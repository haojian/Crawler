My reservation was for 6pm. We were seated at 5:50pm. We were not rushed at all either. Hands down my favorite sushi restaurant in NYC. Sushi Yasuda is a restaurant that will raise the bar for all other sushi restaurants you may have been to. The prices are very reasonable if you stick with the prie fixe. You will also need to try items not on available on the sushi & sashimi combination list. You can tell the quality is set to whole different level. Try Sushi Yasuda and you will see sushi in a whole different perspective. It has been consistent with the quality of fish and service. I highly recommend dining at the bar. Decor: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Food Presentation: 5/5 Food Taste: 5/5 Favorites: Spanish-Mackerel, Uni from Cali and Egg Custard. All three of these melted in your mouth and were absolutely delicious. -$131 (before tax) for 16pc Spanish-Mackerel, 5pc Salmon, 6pc Striped Bass, 5pc Rainbow Trout, 4pc Uni, 4pc Egg Custard, 6pc Orato, 6pc Tuna, 1pc Rock Crab, 1pc Octopus, 1pc Scallop, 2 rolls, 2 desserts. Each piece is less than $2.40 and that's not factoring in the 2 rolls and 2 desserts!! -I enjoyed eating with my fingers and wiping it clean with the moist finger towel -The green tea mochi and green tea ice cream were the perfect ending to a perfect sushi dinner

It is a classic Japanese restaurant that was packed, even though it was a Tuesday. I got takeout and everything was outstanding: from presentation to taste, it was fabulous. It is definitely one of the best sushi restaurants I've been too. The sushimi melts in your mouth, the rolls taste authentic, everything is beautifully presented. Please note that if you are not a sushi fan, you probably won't like it. It does not cater to a standard American population that prefers imitation crab over raw fish. But if you are really into sashimi and simple, fresh rolls, welcome home: you will be coming back. A couple of things to note: - it is not that easy to find. It does not have a shiny display and I had to double-check I was in the right place. - it's a traditional Japanese restaurant: service and takeout are slow - make a reservation!

Sushi Yasuda is probably the best sushi place that I've tried in the city so far, though I admit that I haven't been to either Sushi of Gari or Masa. The restaurant itself is pristine and spacious by New York standards. The sushi chefs and waitstaff are immaculately dressed. The sushi itself is amazing. I loved every piece. It's incomparably fresh and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The uni was hands down the best uni I've sampled in the city. Sushi Yasuda is a great place for sushi purists who simply love the taste of nigiri or sashimi. Would love to come back some day for the omakase!

I'm gonna say that if you can appreciate really good sushi then this is the place to go! I've heard people say it's expensive (price wise yeah) but for the quality of the fish I think it's well worth it. The pieces are smaller than what you'd get at a normal restaurant as well as more expensive per piece but again, quality cannot be beat and this is coming from someone whose been to Japan and eaten A LOT of sushi over there! Service was really good and the place is very clean and efficient as a Japanese restaurant should be. You're definitely not going there for frills and decorations. Highly recommended.

I'll keep this short. Had the omakase and requested that it contain toro and uni. What came was the best toro and uni I have ever had in my life. So delicious, meltingly tender, and flavorful. I have never had fish with such divine texture and freshness. My eyes literally popped when I put the pieces in my mouth, they were so good. Our omakase included 2 types of toro sashimi, 2 types of toro sushi, uni sushi, and uni handrolls, among other fishy delights. Other stand-outs were the squid sushi and scallop sashimi. I also quite enjoyed our ebi sushi and eel sushi. I would recommend the sushi and hand-rolls over the sashimi--Yasuda is really at a level of its own in those categories. I really appreciated the home-brewed soy sauce and home-made wasabi and ginger. Service was impeccable. I love sushi and I came in with really high expectations. Going back next time and sitting at the bar!

I was first introduced to Yasuda in 2008 and I try to go back to it as often as I can. I have also told many out of town friends visiting NYC to go to Yasuda. I think the fish quality is top notch and I like the quiet, subdued ambience. In my most recent trip (about 4 months ago), I made a reservation for 2 - a good quiet place to catch up with a friend. I was told I must finish my meal by 8 PM (giving us about 90 minutes). I find that a bit snobby but ok, I get it, you have lots of customers and you need to turn the table quickly. As usual, I have found the fish quite good but I found the service absolutely atrocious. They appeared to be rushing us throughout dinner even to the point of being unhappy when we ordered additional fish. At 7:30 (with 30 minutes left to our reservation)when we asked about dessert, they basically snipped that this is the last order they could take from us. I felt disrespected and unappreciated as a customer. It's not clear to me why we got this kind of treatment. We were not drunk. We were polite and said our "please" and "thank you"'s and didn't fuss about anything. I have never felt less welcomed at a restaurant. This is New York. Good food is plenty and with that kind of attitude, I don't find a reason to go back.

Went here on feb 15th for dinner and had the omakase. ?To be fair, if price was not a consideration, this place would get 4 stars but taking into account the bill ($400 for 2 people - no alcohol, just tea), its a 2-3 star deal. I've had better sushi (Ushiwakamaru) for this price range. ?Everything we've had was good but I couldn't say amazing. ? The rice is a bit crumbly though and fell apart quite often.. ? Coupled with the strict time limit on dining (90minutes), i just dont see myself going back here.

My friend took me here for a lovely birthday dinner. ?While I'm not a sushi afficionado and although sushi is not my favorite cuisine, I wanted to give this place a shot since I've heard so many rave reviews. ?I thought it was pretty good but it was expensive for a cuisine that I just don't have a sophisticated palate for. What we got: Flash Fried Monk Fish - yummy light and flaky breading with perfectly cooked fish Sushitake (chef's choice - 2 piece blue fin tuna, 1 piece salmon, 2 piece white fish, 1 piece hamachi, 1 piece spanish mackerel, 1 piece shrimp) - My favorites were the tuna, salmon and mackerel because they were so fresh and melted like butter in my mouth Additional sushi pieces - toro (DELICIOUS!!!), white king salmon (very good), sea scallop (not a huge scallop girl so this was just okay), salmon roe (would not get this next time) Red Bean Mochi Ice Cream Green Tea Ice Cream Service: Our waitress was very attentive and the restaurant was a no frills establishment intent on serving great food with a 1.5 hour turn-around.

This place is one of a kind. I've never had sushi like this before. All the fish literally melts in your mouth. We ordered the omakase and spent about $100 per person. If you want more food, you can order more. I especially enjoyed the toro (fatty tuna), ikura with quail egg, and the oyster. The salmon had too much of a smoky taste for me. The service was excellent. Our waitress was such a sweet and cute lady. She said, "our sushi is very good" and then gave us a thumbs up haha. Make sure you make reservations and be on time. Sometimes they have reservations scheduled back to back every hour, so they do want you to try to finish your meal in an hour.

I've never liked sushi until I joined a study abroad program to Japan. All the food in Japan was superb. I'm drooling while reminiscing the bits and pieces of memory I have left. I was totally in love with sushi ever since the trip. I haven't visited any places in New York close enough to Japan's quality, until a friend of mine brought me here. It's still not as good as Japan but I must say this is so far the best I've had in New York. I haven't tried a lot of high end sushi places, therefore I can't say this is the best of the best... but definitely great quality ! TIP: My friend knew a little trick in eating here for the bang of your buck. First order a sushi deluxe meal which comes with a variety of assorted sushi/sashimi, and some of chef's choice. The meal is so worth it. Every piece melted in my mouth. DROOLS! You prod won't get full but you shouldn't stuff yourself eating sushi either. It's about quality, not quantity. ?There after, order the pieces you want separately. It can get really pricey but the quality is well worth it! My favorite was the scallop! It was super fresh and tasty! yummmmm. I had plenty of other sushi/sashimi pieces. They were all delicious!!!!! I'd rather rate this a 4.5 instead of a 5 star only b/c there's other famous sushi restaurants in NYC that I haven't tried yet. Japan is #1 !!! All you sushi foodie must make a trip out there!!!! BTW, the Japanese gov. is inflating their currency currently and continuing to in the next one-two years. $ to ? is currently 93.57!!! Go, Go, Go ! :)

All I wanted for my birthday (besides a pony, which I still have not received) was to go to Yasuda for omakase. Didn't have much trouble scoring a reservation for 2 at the bar, and they were accommodating when I had to reschedule my reservation an hour before it was to occur (damn you, flu!). When my friend and I arrived, we were informed that if we could finish our meal in an hour, we could sit right in front of Head Chef Mitsuru. Ummm....yes please! Sitting in front of the chef was a fantastic experience that helped me justify shelling out $105 pp for sushi, although it was worth every penny! Service was attentive the staff had a lovely demeanor. I have a very soft spot for mediocre sushi around NYC, and I'm afraid that after eating at Yasuda, I'm ruined! Everything was so fantastic down to the sushi rice. Highlights from the omakase were amaebi, mackerel, and scallop. We also ordered flash-fried monkfish as an app, and it was light and clean, especially for a fried dish! Being at a place like Yasuda makes me wish it was my birthday every day, or at the least, that I could afford to eat like it's my birthday every day!

Really good! A bit pricey but definitely worth trying. I came here for lunch with a couple of my coworkers. You need to make reservation before you go. My favorite was the delicious sea scallop. I also had their king roll and some really yummy ice cream in the end. I'd recommend this place to my friends if they're looking for some fresh and yummy sushi!

This place is legen, wait for it, dary!! The sushi is amazing, the quality of the sushi is superb, and the service was good as well. Only go to this place if you are a true sushi connoisseur, not if your definition of eating sushi is a California roll and if you really feel adventurous a spicy tuna roll. You will not like this place if you fall into that category. Yasuda has a large selection of fish and exotic fish at that. They have more than 5 types of tuna, more than 6 types of salmon, eel from all over the place. Large selection of fish. The restaurant is aimed at authentic Japanese cuisine so the menu has some lots of sushi, sashimi, and maki. There are no specialty rolls like shrimp tempura roll, California roll, and others that you have been use too at other american sushi establishments. The cost for dinning is moderate to high. I spent $250 for my wife and myself and we did not have any alcohol but the cost is worth the quality of the sushi. Also we ordered every single variety of tuna, salmon, eel, yellow tail, makrol, white fish, uni and 3 rolls of maki. I went a little over board since I haven't had this type of sushi and variety since I was in Japan many years ago. In conclusion this place is great. This is a place you should not miss in you are in the area. Also make a reservation, they do not take walk-ins and they don't like you lingering after your meal. You have about 90 minutes to eat and pay which sucks but I understand why. They run their reservations like a swiss clock, if you have reservations at 8:00 you will be seated at your table by 8:01. So its great that they honor their clients time.

I came here for lunch and liked it-- but here's the deal. If you sit at the sushi bar it can be awesome or weird as hell depending on how much eye contact you'd like to make with your sushi chef. He was just serving me. In a packed room. ?Also- every time you take a bite, he was watching for approval. The fish is fresh and they know what they are doing. I would definitely go at least once but not by yourself because it will be a staring contest with you and the sushi maker. And he will win.

Since the departure of chef yasuda, the quality turned subpar. The sushi is barely acceptable as a top notch restaurant. The fish is soft and melts in your mouth but its far from being fresh and tasty as it was before. The rice was dry and waiter as usual was impolite. We found a huge fish scale in the sushi and complained. The waiter looked at me weird and said "that's fish...you want another one?" I had to raise my voice and demanded that the chef should be aware of this...Good bye sushi yasuda...I had a magical time 3 years ago but now your glory days are gone...It is just not worth the price...and I know the value what good money should buy for a meal.

Best sushi I've had in New York (disclaimer: I've never been to Masa). I had a belly ache after I ate but from overeating, I didn't know how to say NO when every prior piece was so amazing. ? Sit at the sushi bar and let the sushi chefs guide your meal. ? The service can be a bit overbearing - mainly the women who are constantly refilling your water and leaning over you but I prefer that to negligent wait staff.

I'm surprised at how highly this is rated. My experience here was "aite" but certainly not the life-changing sushi adventure that other Yelpers seemed to have had. My partner and I ordered a variety of nigiri. Fish itself was great, especially liked the toro. What really got my goat was the dry, crumbly rice. Whatever was going on with the rice that day, it didn't end well for the texture of the nigiri. It might seem a little petty to harp on the rice quality, but bad rice seems like a big flaw for a place that prides itself on masterful sushi preparation, In the interest of being a pleasant dinner companion I didn't mention my rice issues, but my date brought up the rice quality on the way out. At least I'm not going crazy. Place is nice, if a bit hard to find (inconspicuous exterior). The interior of the restaurant is all super-sexy wood, definitely liked that part. Walk-in seating was easy to get at ~9PM on a weeknight. It's on the exorbitant side of pricey and at this level of hype/cost I was expecting more. Based on the glowing reviews, I'm willing to believe that this was just an "off-rice-night", wouldn't recommend it though.

The chef we were paired up with was awesome! He told us everything we were eating. Everything is so fresh as well! I have been to Japan and LOVED the sushi we had at Tsukiji market - it was the best!

We've been to Yasuda several times so I feel I can review quite thoroughly. You can't go wrong with the omakase at the counter. Be open to trying things you don't necessary like because I can guarantee you these raw clams, oysters, scallops, etc aren't the ones in your local market. Each piece of sushi shines on its own and is seasoned so perfectly, you will swear off generic crispy spicy mango whatever rolls that probably have so much crap in them to hide the flavor of the mediocre fish. Extra bonus points for our sushi chef observing my left handedness and positioning my pieces of sushi accordingly. Wow!

I feel bad for doing this... especially since my friend treated me to a sushi and sashimi omakase dinner with sake here a few weeks ago... but I just wasn't super impressed with Sushi Yasuda. Prior to my visit, many of my friends kept telling me that this would be the best sushi I've ever had. My experience was for lack of a better word a let down. Maybe my expectations were too high? Look, I am an avid (i.e. obsessed) sushi connoisseur and I KNOW when I've got high quality fish in my mouth. I thought it was decent but not mind blowing, and trust me, I've had my mind blown by sushi. How is one's mind blown by sushi? You take the piece of nigiri/sashimi in your chopstick, place it in your mouth, slightly chew and from out of nowhere this feeling of warmth and butteriness is released into your mouth that you never want to end. Your eyes will close. The world stops just for a moment. You don't want to swallow because once you do the feeling disappears... unless you have another. And another. And another. *Waits for the men to nervously loosen their shirt collars* See, I told you I was obsessed with sushi... As stated before, we had the sushi and sashimi omakase. Oh and some miso soup to start and a bottle of hot sake. No maki rolls. We kept it very traditional. The portions were on the small side as to be expected. Nothing really exotic comes to mind about the selection of fish we received. Again, the sushi was good and fresh but NOT mind blowing especially for the price (which by the way came to $300 including alcohol). Although the food did not meet my high expectations, the service was impeccable and our waitress made sure that our every need was met. Still, for the price tag I just don't think it's worth the reservation effort. It was a good experience and I believe that everyone deserves a chance so please don't write them off. Maybe it was an off night. Maybe I'll come back again someday and think "whoa what was I thinking?" but let's be honest, that wont' be anytime soon... especially if it's on my dime.

Sometimes language barriers arise that cause confusion and consternation. ?While this would be really bad in certain circumstances, like in a missile silo ((Major Tom) "Private Jenkins, I need to take a pee! ?(Private Jenkins) 'Ok Major I'll turn my key!) ", it is almost as bad when making reservations. ?When the restaurant in question is really in demand, the ability, or lack thereof, of the host to accurately transcribe your name is in fact determinative of whether you'll eat there. So it is with Sushi Yasuda. ?This top notch sushi joint lives up to all the rave reviews. ?It is pricey, so be prepared for some sticker shock, or better yet, get someone else to treat you (ladies this is a good time to cash in that credit you've been saving for your boyfriend's screw up du jour). ?However, you'll need to keep two things in mind: First, make a reservation, or you'll be eating at the Mexican food cart down the block. ?You better make that reservation well in advance, and don't think you won't need one on say a Tuesday night. Second, make sure the person taking your reservation gets your name right. ?These folks just about denied me entry because they misspelled my name; it was only the phone number that saved me. ?Their English isn't the best, so you might just want to book it under "Jones" or "Smith" instead of Yastremski or Sczepeck.

Did not disappoint! Ordered omakase sashimi for 2 and got 6 pieces each of fluke, mackerel, amberjack, king salmon, fatty tuna, scallop and mirugai (translated as giant clam) and everything was delicious. Highlights were definitely the tuna (tasted like butter), scallop (so sweet and tender) and clam (perfect texture and briny like the best part of an oyster). Tab with one app and a seaweed salad, one beer and one sake came out to $125. Definitely worth it!

If you saw the movie "The Last Samurai" with Tom Cruise, you may remember the scene towards the end where Ken Watanabe's life drawing close to an end. He is in a serene state when he sees this beautiful cherry blossom tree. His last words are, "it is 'pah-fact'." The sushi at Yasuda is exactly that. ?"Pah-fact". Close your eyes. Place the nigiri gently into your mouth. Be sure to taste the food and try not to swallow too quickly, ?because it will melt in your mouth. Forbes rated this establishment #12 restaurant in all of United States. Second best Japanese restaurant only after Masa which I probably will never go due to the $500 per head damage.

After hearing two of my friends rave about the quality of the sushi here, I decided to book a reservation - making sure to get a seat at the sushi bar because you get your own sushi chef if you do that! And you get to watch him prepare your sushi on the spot and give him suggestions for or ask questions about ?the next sushi order as your meal progresses, which is fun. I did the omakase - I asked my sushi chef to stop at $100 (and he did just that - it actually came out to just under $100), and asked him to make sure to include the hotate (scallop sushi), and sea urchin at some point during the meal. Those ended up being my favorites (the hotate just melted in your mouth and the sea urchin was the best I've ever had, so fresh), in addition to one of the anago (sea eel) that they had that night. I went with someone who actually doesn't love trying different types of raw fish - she got a piece of toro which she loved, and ordered the flash fried prawns with green tea powder and the sea bass. The prawns were beautifully presented, and I tried the sea bass, which was buttery and in a tasty sauce. We both thought they did a great job with the cooked food even though they're not known for it (focus is on the sushi). The prawns and sea bass were decently priced too. Definitely expect to splurge if you decide to go the sushi route though! It will probably be the best sushi you've ever had. Service is very efficient, and you feel completely taken care of throughout your meal. Reservations were easier to get than I expected - you should try to call a few weeks in advance, ask for seats at the sushi bar, and remember to keep your reservation number safe and call back the day before to confirm your reservation!

What can I say about Yasuda that hasn't already been said. This is amazing stuff that will blow a hole in your wallet but also in your pallet. None of the 50% off all rolls, etc. etc. here. Only thing I have to add that others might not have already said... Make reservations (by the bar if you can) Arrive early (but if not, definitely ON TIME, they won't serve you if you're late!)

I set a reservation the night beforehand (with two other individuals in the same room) for a reservation of "six people" with a person over the phone for 7:30 PM. ?I took down the reservation number at that time as 2803. ?We were asked to make certain we arrived early. ? We arrived early and were taken to a table for two. ?

Then a server named Taku (?) very warmly told us "the reservation is for three" and "we do not make mistakes." ?Here, they violated the quintessential rule that the customer is always right (especially when the customer was actually right!). Obviously, this ruined our plans for the evening. ?We really looked forward to sharing what promised to be a lovely dining experience. ? What is most unacceptable about this scenario is that as a family, we were all dressed appropriately, had made appropriate reservations, and were composed of three New York City attorneys, one officer in a health care corporation, and our mother. ?We are pretty precise about the language we use. ?We have also shared ?in a number of fine(r) dining experiences. ? If you would like a fine dining experience, you have to get through the door. ?We were very willing to pay for our dinners and think it shameful the way in which we were treated by the staff. ?We hope this serves as a warning to other potential customers, and we will certainly share with others: Your money can be better spent elsewhere.

Here is my first review for the dream sushi place !!! The sushi was so tender and it melted in our month. ? We went there after watching the movie Jiro dreams of Sushi and Sushi Yasuda has met all of our high expectations. Quote from the movie , "There are five attributes to a great chef: 1. Take your work seriously 2. Aspire to improve 3. Maintain cleanliness 4. Be a better leader than a collaborator 5. Be passionate about your work." -Yamamoto, Food Critic The space was very warm, basic, and clean, yet very sophisticated. ? We asked for Omakase and were very happy with the chief's selections. ?The eel came separately at the end and it was a nice surprise. ?I like fatty tuna the best. ?Octopus was very interesting ... The sushi was very simple and very tasty. ?Omakase is 20 pieces for two people. We completed the dinner with Mochi icecream and ?the brown rice tea. Looking forward to going back , this time of course seating at the bar :) Nimet

A little disappointed. We ordered the sushi combo. It's cheap,but not fresh or tasty. I made a reservation of two in sushi bar, but the waiter made a mistake. And he did not correct it or explain it.

In and out for lunch in 40 minutes. I can't really give a full 5 stars until I come for the dinner omakase experience. But for lunch, it's definitely not a 5 star experience. The service was bare minimum. No explanations, no recommendations, no friendliness, no smiles even. They just do what they have to do. The atmosphere was almost kind of sterile. Not sure exactly what it is about this place, but I didn't feel comfortable just sitting there after I finished eating. Huh. Very much like a spot to get quick lunch during a short business lunch break. Not so endearing. The sushi is definitely on another level compared to other places. Some fish are better than others. I was wow-ed by the sawara (spanish mackerel) and the eel. Those were simply amazing. The uni was alright but I was sad to see they didn't offer any other kinds of uni (maybe only for the omakase experience?). The otoro was actually pretty bad. Huh. For some reason, maybe I'm just nitpicking, but I thought the sushi rice was a bit too hard. I also did not see any monkfish liver on the menu. Which is sad because I love love love ankimo. :( I guess I really have to come back for dinner to experience what everyone else has experienced because lunch just wasn't much of an experience.

Sushi Yasuda seems to be the gold standard that all NYC sushi places are compared against. ?The interior decor is very clean and stark, almost to the point where the wood looks too hard to be comfortable. ?I wouldn't say it's a welcoming atmosphere, but we're not here for the decor anyway. I've ordered omakase here. ?Unlike Sushi of Gari which adds more flavoring, Sushi Yasuda is more focused on the fish. ?Both are excellent in their own way. ?The fish is very fresh and clean tasting. ?I really should take notes next time of what everything is, because the selection can be a bit overwhelming. ?It's not at all your standard salmon sashimi fare. ?Every time I've been there, all the fish is served on a stone slab that everyone eats from (family style). ?It's beautifully laid out. ? Service is sprightly as they focus on table turnover. ?I've gone here for lunch at noon and when we're exiting at 1 pm, there's a line going out the door. ?Even when it's pouring outside, there is always a line. ?Dinner isn't as busy but the restaurant has always been full. ?Key takeaway: You MUST make a reservation. ? Sake is quite good too ;)

Total: 4.0 When I had sushi at 15 east and people sitting next to me told about Sushi Yasuda where they think it's the best in town. A week after, I visited here by myself and was seated at a sushi bar. I ordered Omakase, the chef's selection of sashimi and sushi where the price was unknown. Before going to Sushi Yasuda, I had a rumor about their super high price and hesitated to order Omakase (Chef's selection menu) for a while. After having dinner with one beer, I received a receipt and it said $107. It was expensive but not as much as I expected. Food: 4.0 Great! Sashimi was very fresh without a fishy smell and sushi was great too. Absolutely top notch in New York and I could recommend for everyone who would like to enjoy traditional and authentic sushi around Midtown. Memo: I heard that Mr. Yasuda no longer makes sushi. Service 3.5 Good. The waitstaff was professional and attentive. It took a little while to serve drinks after ordering. Decor Good. The sushi bar counter is huge and has approximately 15 seats total so that you may find a seat at the sushi bar easily. Their dining space is also roomy and you may be comfortable and relaxed to enjoy your meals. Attention: a person sitting next to me wore a lot of perfume which spoils the flavour of sushi. Please do not put a lot of perfume when having sushi, especially sitting at a sushi bar.

There's not much that can be said that hasn't already. ?Yasuda serves as my benchmark for a great dining experience. ?Sad to hear that Chef Yasuda no longer works here. ? Hands down my favorite sushi restaurant in Manhattan. ?Yasuda's unique style to nigiri sushi is often described as "cute". ?They definitely have a signature style when it comes to making their sushi; and every other sushi chef in the US knows it. The service at this place is also something that every other establishment should strive to achieve. ?+1 for great service. Omakase is definitely the way to go when you get here. ?The steamed monkfish liver is also a must-have. ?+1 Star for simply the highest quality fish around. The take-out here is also outrageous. ?$25 for 6 pieces and a roll. ?Definitely well worth the price considering you're getting some of the best sushi in Manhattan. ?They do the sushi box for both lunch and dinner. ?+1 Star for value. The decor is also very Zen. ?Apparently the sushi bar was hand made. ?They also don't utilize the standard glass fridge on the bar like every other sushi shop under the sun. ?You can definitely see how Yasuda shares some ideas and opinions on how fish should be prepared and stored with Jiro Ono, owner of Sukiyabashi Jiro. ?You don't see this sushi restaurant with those glass fridges and they're the best in the world. +2 stars for decor and following Sukiyabashi. Yasuda provides the best combination of food, service, and price out of any other sushi restaurant I've been to in Manhattan thus far.

"I am disappointed", said Taste Bud#1 as she rolled her eyes and proceeded without hesitation to fall asleep. Taste Bud #2 frowned, and followed suit. Fine, my taste buds' expectations were elevated considering a few people recommended this place with very high regard. The most aggravating thing about eating here was the flimsy rice crumpling all over the place. MEH. so I decided to give the sashimi a try. Although the sashimi was fresh, it did not possess the succulent distinctiveness which one would involuntarily close their eyes, shut off their mind, and deeply and thoroughly indulge in the orgazmic bliss that is emerging from within. (To achieve the previously mentioned, sit at the bar and chose omakse at Sushi Seki or Sushi of Gari.) The service was efficient. The d¨¦cor is wood and tidy clean, but not the most welcoming. I will give it another shot since Forbes rated them #12 in all of the US.

With only a few day in Manhattan you find yourself struggling to decide on where to have dinner. In Japanese Cuisine alone you are left with numerous (Michelin Rated) options spanning the entire spectrum of different types of dining. On my last night in the Big Apple I chose to dine at Sushi Yasuda, although talking amongst New Yorker's several other Sushi-Ya's seem to be more popular at this time. I don't know if this is a direct result of Mr. Yasuda departure to Japan last year. While making my reservation I was asked if their was a Sushi Chef that I would prefer, which was a very nice touch because I believe it's all about the Chef/Customer relationship. Since this was my first time at Sushi Yasuda, I left that decision up to the staff. I arrived early for my reservation (5:50PM) and was seated at the empty tsukeba(Sushi Bar). I was actually the only customer there, and standing at attention if front of me were six professional sushi chefs looking as if they were preparing for a battle on Iron Chef. My dinner started with an Ankimo appetizer which had to be one of the best that I've ever had. Smooth and creamy, almost with the consistency of room temperature butter without that strong liver flavor you sometimes get. This was a nice precursor to one of the best Sushi dinners that I've had in North America. My dinner was delivered to me in EdoMae fashion with the inclusion of a small Sashimi course and then a Nigiri Omakase of the chef's selections. What set this Omakase at Sushi Yasuda different from others that I've experienced was that their was no set price, you just keep eating until your done. You are given an extensive list of sushi and are free to make requests, but towards the end of your dinner you start getting curious on what you have racked up. Alas, good quality sushi like this is priceless!! My sashimi course arrives with maybe seven or eight selections, mainly fish but with a bivalve(Mirugai) and octopus included. Two different types of sea salt and (of course) fresh wasabi are provided. I'm starting to prefer the use of sea salt over wasabi lately, but to be truthful with fish this fresh very little if any wasabi is actually ever needed. For the Nigiri course you are once again provided with fresh wasabi which is completely unnecessary as the neta is stunningly fresh and the Itamae does apply the desired amount into your sushi. More importantly, the temperature of the sumeshi (vinegared rice) was excellent, very moist and with a nice vinegared flavor. Possibly the best sushi rice (along with Mori Sushi in LA) that I've ever tasted. Towards the end of my meal I started conversing with my Itamae about my hometown of Las Vegas, he surprised me that he knows a few of the notable LV Japanese restaurateurs that had previously worked in NYC. I guess that the Japanese Culinary Scene in North America is a small close knit community. Sushi Yasuda, possibly one of the best Sushi-Ya's in North America??

Service = excellent Decor = ok, nothing special Food = very high quality sushi - excellent Price = insane Sat at a table, not the counter. ?Read several reviews on here, not sure what the hubub is about sitting at the counter? ?The food looked the same over there as is did at our table. ?Did not like the fact that they really push people to eat, finish, and leave. ?There actually is a "last call" for food - I am VERY familiar with this concept in drinking establishments, but not in a sushi restaurant. ?Great place for dinner when someone else is treating...but I won't go there on my own or take someone there.

Came here for with the plus one during the week of "no power" post-superstorm sandy. ?It was a celebratory dinner of sorts and we were seated at the "chef's table" watching our neverending sushi being made. ?I like the concept. ?Didn't cover the bill but they charged by the roll so have a feeling it wasn't pretty.

Simple and impressive. I think I was expecting more "bells and whistles" with all the hype surrounding this place, but was initially a bit taken back when we were brought our first plate of sushi. ?Plain and unassuming to the eye, it was not until we began to take our first bites that we realized what sets Sushi Yasuda apart from the rest. The freshness and quality of each piece was fantastic, and we were started to notice subtle notes and hits of flavour that we never noticed before in similar offerings elsewhere. ?The uni had actual layers of flavour we had not experienced before, and the scallop sushi had just this divine texture and richness to it that we did not expect. ?I think what we had the most fun with were trying fish that we typically didn't see at other sushi restaurants, as it brought fresh new flavours to an experience that can sometimes become routine and predictable. Not every sushi we had was "mind-blowing", but it was all absolutely top notch and enjoyable. ?Each piece of sushi was anywhere between $4-8, and for the omakase, they basically brought out as much as you wanted, and were happy to accommodate any requests for favourites.

I add my voice to the chorus of approval for Sushi Yasuda because it is that good. Their strength is simple sushi, focusing on the taste of the fish and the rice, not super-fancy rolls with so many ingredients that I don't even know what I'm eating. I believe it is the freshest fish in New York. The best way to approach Yasuda is to just order the specials as indicated on the menu. If it's included in the specials list, the New Zealand King Salmon sushi is so good that I involuntarily close my eyes and bliss out while eating it. I also love their sea urchin, and this is where I discovered that I don't hate all eel -- saltwater eel is actually amazing. I'm willing to try things at Yasuda that I wouldn't try elsewhere because I trust them. Bonus points for checking their imported fish for radiation levels and caring about their customers' health. Be on time because otherwise you will lose your reservation. And don't be afraid to call on a busy night to see if they have a cancellation -- you may get lucky.

I truly enjoy Sushi Yasuda so much that I will make a special trip to NY just to have the pleasure of eating there. I won't repeat what others have said. ?It's obvious the overwhelming consensus is A) their fish is sublime and B) omakase is the way to go. What I will do, instead, is provide a list of pointers on how to make the most of your experience. You must call ahead to make a reservation. You must also call the day before your reservation to confirm it. If you don't call, they will call you to be sure you are coming. If you run late at all, don't make it past 10 minutes. They make it clear when you confirm your reservation that they -will- give your seat up after 10 minutes. If you sit at the sushi bar, your reservation is good for 1.5 hours. They mean it. Seriously. On my last visit, Yoshi was our sushi chef and from now on, I will make sure I can sit in front of only him. He warned (nicely) that we should put wasabi on the fish first, then lightly dip in soy sauce. The reason is because their wasabi is fresh and if you put it in the soy sauce, it will lose the delicate flavor that it imparts on the fish. I loved how mild and flavorful it was at the same time-this ain't that sinus clearin' stuff. I specifically asked for 80% sashimi, 20% nigiri (fish over rice). ?Once I had several delicious, melt in your mouth slices of sashimi, the nigiri started coming. This is another opportunity to really feel the difference between Yasuda and other sushi bars. Their rice is like no other. ?Small mounds, perfectly seasoned, and just the right temperature. The soy sauce they brush on the nigiri doesn't require you to dip it in your own soy sauce; if you do, it will be too salty, and you don't want to waste that precious, buttery fish. As you enjoy your meal, there will be some fussing over you in the background. The servers are constantly changing things out so that you'll always have a fresh towel, fresh dipping bowl for soy sauce, fresh finger tip towel, etc. If you're ever unsure about something, just ask your chef or server. I am not a sushi/sashimi connoisseur, but I do enjoy and appreciate quality, and to me, quality means that the fish is clean; smells clean; is buttery and contains texture at the same time; and tastes clean. All I can tell you is my first experience was a little overwhelming, but I learned quickly. You're paying good money for what's being put in front of you at Yasuda, don't be afraid to ask. And if you sit in front of Yoshi, well, he's simply the best. Humble, been in the business a long time, and very nice. Enjoy!

Went there with a friend of mine last night. ? Food was fantastic. If you are looking to the freshest sashimi, look no further. This is the place. My favorites were the Uni, scallops, and fatty tuna. The seabass appetizer soaked in sake was excellent. the green tea mochi ice cream was great, but obviously it's not the healthiest thing, so ordered one to share. HOWEVER, our waitress was terrible. she was Japanese and was clueless. she rushed us and just didn't get it. terrible service. we also had to wait for 20 mins for our table, even though we had a reservation for 9. We were seated next to a loud table of 6 people....disturbing... would go back, but definitely need a seat at the bar and better service.

Welcome to Sushi Yasuda, a clean modern looking Japanese restaurant with absolutely no signage to demarcate white lies within. ?In fact, I literally walked by the restaurant and had to look for the building number before I knew I had stumbled to the right place. For my entree consisted of the chef's choice. ?The rules for this game is simple. ?You tell the waiter what you don't like to eat and the chef will make whatever he feels like making. ?What Sushi Yasuda excels at is getting the freshest ingredients and making the perfect rice. Let's be honest, the entire concept of sushi is incredibly simple. ?You have rice and you have fish. ?The flavors are simplistic, the number of ingredients is minimal, and execution is tantamount to perfection. ?And Sushi Yasuda without a doubt executes everything to perfection. ?What really distinguishes this place from every other sushi joint is the quality of their fish and that's about it. ?Their sushi is indeed good, but is it really worth the $$$? ?I'm on the fence about that since I ended up dropping about $120 just for myself not including tip and eating two dollar slices on my way to Grand Central. ?However, this is definitely the best sushi I've had thus far.

Sushi Yasuda... we have a problem. You have ruined sushi for me. Anywhere else I get it ever again will just not be good in comparison. I came here for a surprise birthday dinner, knowing this place had a reputation for pure sushi without any of the fluff or non-sense... no volcano rolls here. We did the Omakase (which if you go, you must do) and were really surprised at every bite. We started with a little bit of sashimi of toro, yellowtail, and squid. The the toro had that collagen type stickiness you get with fatty meats where the fat just melts in your mouth. This was the case here. The squid was tender and creamy... if you have ever had truly good squid sushi, you know what I am talking about here. We then had a whole lot of other pieces of sushi (white salmon, king salmon, yellowtail, uni, shrimp, oyster, squid, 2 types of toro, 2 types of eel, and a few others I cannot recall). So many of the pieces were so tender and melt in your mouth delicious, you could have eaten them without teeth. For me, the absolutely must have items of the meal were the squid sashimi, the uni (food orgasam), and the oyster. The uni and oyster were so amazingly melt in your mouth delicious that I feel like I am understating just how good they were. It is not a cheap meal... came to about $300 for 2 of us with a few bottles of sake. That being said... pieces seem to be mostly $4-$10 a piece a la carte... I think I want to come back here to just get some of the more amazing pieces, but fear of not getting the best of the day, I would probably get the Omakase again, with an extra 200 pieces of uni and oyster on the side.

After a day of shopping, I visited Yasuda. I had a lot of shopping bags with me, and they put them begin the hostess desk so I didn't have to carry them to my table. Walking into this place felt very serene. Their rice is the best sushi rice I ever had! I loved the flavor, and it wasn't too dry or too moist...it was perfect! The service was impeccable! (Something I don't say often about restaurants.) The fish was fresh, and our food came out quickly.

I didn't like sushi until I had sushi at Yasuda, it is literally taste-bud changing. First time I went, I had omakase, found what I liked, and subsquently have been ordering a la carte. ? The rice is amazing, I can eat a huge bowel of just the rice. I like all of the fish, they are fresh, and there are awalys a good variety. My other ?favorites are uni, scallop, and the 5-6 kinds of eel. ?I personally don't care for the large oyster, squid and octopus. The pieces are the perfect size for one bite, so the prices range $3 to $5.50 for most pieces. I need about 20 pieces to be happy. In addition to sushi and sashimi, they also have other food items, but I haven't tried them. Call for a reservation and ask to sit at the bar, this way, you can have each piece it is made. They may give you a time limit on the bar seat, but is usually no less than 1.5 hrs, which is enough time. They don't really have a dessert menu. Great service and calming ambiance.

Awesomely Fresh Fish! Finally made it here after hearing multiple times that it was the best sushi in NY. ? As would be expected, reservations are needed well in advance, even for lunch. The decor is kind of bland, the usual sort of businessy midtownish type spot. But... the Fish is ON POINT We had all sorts of different things, some of my go to standards as well as some that were just recommended as the best in house. Maguro, Oysters, Scallops, Clams, Salmon, all the sushi comes out on banana leaves, pre-brushed with the correct soy sauce to make it a perfectly composed bite, in the eyes of your chef. They had different sauce combinations for different fish, and brushed the adequate amount of flavoring on with a small basting or paint brush, ?so that just enough kick was added without overshadowing the delicate nature of the fish. Also, I thought it was cool that they have different mini fridges behind the chef's counter, set to different temperatures to store the various kinds of fish at their ideal temps. Small things, that show the level of attention to detail that give you unparalleled seafood! Cons: it is not cheap, nor romantic... Go there for the love of the fish!

I came here several months ago for the lunch special. I got to eat some of the best sushi in the country (if not the best) for less than $30. I had a reservation for one made a few days in advance, but at the last minute my friend wanted to come. The staff called in the morning to confirm the reservation and I asked if we could change the reservation to add another person. They accommodated me without any trouble! When we arrived, the place was very busy. It was full of business people and you could tell that this was also a place of regulars for lunch. The sushi was truly delicious. I had some sort of combination of nigiri and sashimi, chosen by the sushi chef for what was good for the day. Granted, it's not a huge amount of food, but how else could you try this place for such an amazing deal? Terrific quality and attentive staff, but not overly attentive how it can be sometimes at Japanese restaurants where you feel them hovering over you.

Definitely one of my favorite omakase experiences, if not my all-time favorite. On the reservations process: After reading all the yelp reviews, I felt super antsy about holding onto a reservation at the sushi bar, but my experience was a lot easier than expected. ?I called Monday morning before the restaurant opened to get a reservation for 2 on Friday at the sushi bar. ?I got a choice between 5pm & 9:15pm. ?I took the later reservation & received my 4-digit reservation number with instructions to call back to confirm my reservation the day before. ?After confirming my reservation Thursday morning, I was set. ?My friend and I ended up arriving at the restaurant super early (overcompensating to avoid being late) - like 45 minutes early - but the host was super nice, friendly, and accommodating. ?We lucked out in that our reservation was open already so we were seated right away. I wasn't expecting much in the way of service from reading previous yelp reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. ?The host and wait staff were extremely friendly and nice; we never felt rushed. ?Our sushi chef was also really sweet and kind, very fun to talk to while we ate. I can't remember exactly how many pieces we had, but we got a good amount of sushi and sashimi. ?We were able to try pretty much all of the recommended fish for that day. ?My favorites were probably the Santa Barbara uni and oyster. ?All of the fish was perfectly fresh, cut precisely, and served with deliciously warm rice. ?It was definitely one of the best omakase experiences I've had to date. We ate until we were full & the cost was reasonable considering quality. ?Including cold sake and tip, we paid $150/pp, and I think the meal was well worth it. ?Overall, I'd definitely recommend Sushi Yasuda for omakase and hope to return again soon!

This is my second visit to Sushi Yasuda and I have to say the first time was a lot better. I enjoyed my second visit but the reason why the first was better was because my boyfriend and I sat by the sushi bar, the second time around we came in a group of 5 which they sat us at a table. The experience at the bar was an eye-opening experience. You can watch as the sushi chefs prepare the pieces of sushi for you and within a 10-15 second gap of it from the sushi chef's hand to your mouth is the crucial part. You don't want your sushi sitting for a good few minutes because it loses it's texture and "feel". Both experience here was superb. The waiters and waitresses were extremely helpful and nice. They always make sure that your tea/water is filled and comes by occassionally to check on how everything is. Things you would want to do here -- -Ask if there are anything off the menu (if you're sitting at the bar) -Definitely try the east and west coast uni (if they have) -Try not to go in such a large group (preferably two, so you can sit by the bar and get treated like a king/queen) -Order the sushi and forget the sashimi (their sushi rice is outstanding) Yes, it can be quite a wallet breaker but it's worth it if you want to impress your date. If you control yourself, you can hit about $100-150 a person but if you're going all out and enjoying yourself (which I do suggest because it would be a crime not to order everything on the a la carte menu) then you're going to be about running about $250ish a person. Trust me, it's worth it - keeping everything into account, the service, the atmosphere, and the food.

Visited Yasuda last week for a dinner omakase at the counter. I've always wanted to visit Yasuda due to all the great reviews. Prices wise I thought it was actually not as expensive as I thought... Good pieces: anago - delicious - soft, flavorful, much better than the unagi piece that came with the anago. Ikura - fresh, not salty at all, significantly better than the ikura I've had at other places. Scallop and scallop "guts" - the guts were beautifully presented and tasted very smooth and flavorful. Uni - no need to explain Not-so-good pieces: Toro - I was quite disappointed at the toro. I went to Gari a few days later and had toro that was much better in terms of flavor and texture. I was slightly disappointed at the toro but you definitely can't go wrong with anago or uni at yasuda.

I just had my second visit to Sushi Yasuda and have some things to clarify. Sushi Yasuda has fantastic sushi and I will agree with the consensus that this may be the best sushi you can get in America. ?At the very least, I can vouch for their Sawani (Eel) and Aji (Mackerel). ?It is absolutely phenomenal and while you may find something on par, I'm certain that you won't find anything better in grade anywhere else in the USA. That being said, it hurts to say that I am convinced that Yasuda falls short from being ?considered in a world class category (sorry Bourdain). Now....I have found a slew of problems and I hope Sushi Yasuda fixes some of these issues in the near future. Here goes: 1) Lousy preparation. ?One of the chefs, who I will not name, served my Ikura (salmon roe) wrapped in seaweed. ?It was unevenly wrapped and 1/2 of the seaweed was off from its proper position and protruded at a 45 degree angle upwards. ?I was in disbelief, so I checked the person next to me and saw that the maki that he ordered was unevenly cut and squashed. ?In addition, the seared Toro that I ordered was only 1/2 seared on top. ?This is unacceptable. ?In all fairness, however, I took note of the other chefs to my left and right. ?The cuts and preparations were fine. ?This is clearly a chef specific problem. ? 2) Blue Fin Toro. The toro lacked the repugnant stench during my previous visit and it melted instantaneously in my mouth. ?I know that Yasuda serves blue fin toro and it is the highest grade of toro that a sushi restaurant can serve. ?However, not all blue fin toro is equal. ?The highest grades of blue fin toro come from colder regions where the fat content of the tuna is higher (for obvious reasons). ?While, I'm no expert on tuna, I am absolutely positive that this is not the highest grade toro because my experience at Sushi Kyubei's sister restaurant has told me otherwise. ?The highest grade of toro almost made me fall off my chair. This was not. 3) Small pieces. ?To give the perception that prices are somewhat in line with the norm, Sushi Yasuda uses smaller cuts of fish and therefore creates smaller sushi pieces. ?If the pieces are too small, you cannot enjoy the texture and flavor in your mouth as much as you would eating a larger piece (I would gladly pay twice the price for a larger piece). ?This reason is why I would have to knock down about 1/2 point from the best in class sushi restaurants in Japan. ? 4) Service. ?The service was not bad, but it was problematic. ?Because I wasn't satisfied with the toro, I ordered 1 piece of the seared toro for my girlfriend. ?She received a piece and I received a piece I did not order (I didn't bother to argue). ?Also, I had to remind the sushi chef 3 times what I ordered. ?The chefs at Yasuda do not write down what you order, but keep them in memory until you finish your meal (to replicate the high end experience you would get in Japan). ? If you can't remember what a customer is ordering perhaps it's best to write it down right then. To make this not sound like a rant and complain review, I'm going to provide some constructive criticism to fix some problems (#1 and #4). ? From what I've seen, the root of the problematic service and lousy preparation is the pressure that chefs have to serve food in a timely manner. ?The chefs are rushed BIGTIME especially when everyone flocks in at once at 6PMish when the restaurant opens. ?All of the orders will flock in to 4 chefs and it's not a pretty sight. ?What Yasuda needs to do is stagger the seating of small groups of customers by 5-7 minutes so the chef has time to prepare the sushi without feeling so rushed. ? Contrary to most top sushi joints I eat in Japan and Korea, I feel super tense eating at Yasuda because the sushi chef is so stressed. ?And while I like engaging in small talk with my sushi chef to learn a little bit of sources of the fish, his experiences working in previous restaurants and so forth, it is almost an impossibility at Yasuda (at least at the 6PM reservation). ? On a final note, if i had to recommend a reservation time, I suggest at 7:30pm and beyond. ?My guess is that the pressure is probably not there when the restaurant opens because the customers are getting seated at different times (because initial wave of customers are finishing their meals at different times). This is only a hypothesis, but will soon be tested. ?I will update my review once I find the answer from my next visit.

My first time trying omakase, and I'm so glad I did. I don't think I've ever had fish this good in my life. It was so sweet and tender, I WISH I COULD EAT IT EVERY DAY. It is on the expensive side though-I think I spent $25+ on that meal. But it was definitely worth it. Each sashimi was especially made with different types of seasoning on it. The waiter explained it all but I don't quite remember. All I remember was, I was so sad to see it slowly disappear. Awesome awesome place to take someone on a date.

My bf and I were very disappointed with this place b/c we saw all the great reviews so we wanted to try out this place when we visited NY. My bf called for a reservation for 6:30pm and the guy who answered said ok and said we would need to be out by 8pm. Um...I never heard of a restaurant giving a time limit for its customers to eat so I thought they were just small and did not have a lot of seating. However, the location is quite spacious. They can probably fit a table or two more in there. A minute after we were seated, this man(probably the manager?) asked if we were ready to order and we told him not yet b/c we didn't get a chance to look at the menu at all. He came back a couple minutes and asked us if we had questions and we asked him several questions about the items and what we wanted. He then told our waitress to give us a separate menu for ordering the sushi & sashimi combo. Most of the reviews seem to talk about the Omakase, but we didn't see that on the menu and our waitress and manager didn't mention anything about it so we didn't bother asking about pricing since we felt we were being rushed to order. Maybe only the Omakase is really good, but the rest of the sashimi & sushi, I thought was just okay. The uni and scallops were very good! I would definitely recommend the scallops. For toro lovers, you can skip the toro at this location, the texture and taste of it was very dry. I don't think I will give this place another try. For the price Yasuda expects me to pay, I expect my sushi & sashimi to be way better than average, but what I tasted was average or maybe just average.

I've been to Azabu, Sasabune, Ushiwakamaru, Sushi of Gari, and 15 East but I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Sushi Yasuda because it was my first experience with REAL sushi. When I say REAL sushi, I'm talking about the kind that you eat with your fingers and it just melts in your mouth and you have to close your eyes so that you can concentrate on savoring the incredible flavors. And afterwards, all you can think is WOW. Sushi Yasuda was my doorway into this type of sushi. As you can imagine, I was really sad when I heard that Chef Yasuda was leaving but it doesn't take away from my love for Sushi Yasuda. ? If you come, you should absolutely sit at the bar. There's no reason to go to a sushi place and sit at a table. Half the experience is watching the chefs. The soft shell crab app is amazing--I get it every time. It's the perfect crispy texture and is packed with flavor. I also love the usual suspects like the unagi, toro, and uni. I didn't like the clam guts but it may have been because I wasn't as adventurous the first time I came here about 2 years ago. It's been great every time I've been back since, sans clam guts.

Sushi Yasuda is just...WOW. All caps. The kind of wow that widens your eyes and drops your jaw except you quickly close your mouth when you realize it's agape to avoid spilling even a drop of that spectacular sushi . Just don't open your mouth when you're drinking their amazing Green Tea... The Kane Miso is another big WOW of eye-popping crab roe mixed with a grainy touch of miso. ?The Hone was another tasty starter, a surprisingly addictive crunchy concoction with salt. Notable highlights from the omekase include rich and savory toro, unbelievably sweet and tasty sockeye salmon, and melt-in-your-mouth NZ king salmon. The mirugai is one of my all-time faves, and uni is always amazing. The Sawani Eel had to be my fave piece of this meal -it is out of this world, and it has rendered me incapable of enjoying eel ever since. Our server was as sweet as the sushi. Soft-spoken but bubbly and ever-so-polite, she made sure the dirty dishes never dwelled. Just be prepared to abide by the rules in Yasuda-san's house. Eat your nigiri with your fingertips and don't add soy or wasabi - it's too perfect to drown in sinus-clearing green stuff or rivers of black. Especially when supping at the sushi bar, be prepared to shut up, snag your sushi with clean fingers, and shove the soy sauce aside. If you'd rather indulge with your own free will, you will find Sushisamba becomes a superior substitute. At Sushi Yasuda, even the biggest WOW is unable to capture the explosion in your mouth when Yasuda's sweet sushi hits. Most people wouldn't describe sushi as sweet, but there is no better word to capture the umami uproar, and there is no better description for the feeling that comes after.

So, I said in another review that Uchi Houston is the best sushi I've ever had--& I stand by it. HOWEVER, Sushi Yasuda is such a close 2nd, that it's really a tie and ties are like kissing your sister. So I'm just going to keep eating lunch here until I'm convinced Yasuda is the best sushi I've ever put past my lips. It's gonna be tough eating perfectly made sushi rice adorned with fish that was killed 5 hours ago off the coast of Greece or wherever and flown in. Nevermind that I don't have access to Uchi anymore. Or the fact that if I keep eating @ Yasuda, I will have to file for bankruptcy.

Why the 3 stars? Overpriced... Not sure if most of yall sushi lovers realized, Yasuda's sushi tend to lend toward the SMALLER size compared to other high end sushi restaurants. I wouldn't mind paying top $$$$ for sushi, but the chefs needs to be more reasonable in giving their patrons a bigger cut of fish. Fuck, i'm paying $5 for a piece of sushi that's not even as long as my baby cousin's dick?! Fuck outta here.... I would rather go to 15 east for sushi. 2 pieces of Yasuda's are equivalent to1 piece of 15 east. BIG DIFFERENCE. Yasuda's rice is a bit more vinegary, which I don't mind. Everything is good from the decor to the service to the freshness of the fish. There is this one person who answers the phone and he is quite rude... Don't appreciate that. The bill for TWO would run you about $160 each after tips and tax, NO DRINKS INVOLVED.

There is none of that 50% off, crunchy roll or spicy mayo stuff (although I love them all!). This is the place to be for good, clean sushi. Fresh, delicious, pure, and like Tommy G. pointed out, it's not as expensive as people may perceive it to be (certainly not cheap though, notice the Yelp dollars). Treat yourself (or be treated) to some grown-up sushi...and don't be late; or kiss your difficult to obtain table goodbye.

The bestest freshest uni (sea urchin) i've ever had in my life. and it wasn't even a red circle chef special suggestion of the night! not a fan of the orange clam. it was a bit tough to chew and there was a shard of large intact salt in my piece? The fish were all in its prime, not even a tinge of fishiness (and I've DEFINITELY have had questionable sushi... yes, what was i thinking...) Go and savor!

It has been some time since I visited Sushi Yasuda, but felt I needed to chime in with a review of this restaurant. ?Like many, I was a bit suspicious of so many five-star reviews. ?Maybe many people have not tried other high-end sushi. ?Maybe they assume California Rolls are the only types of sushi. ?Maybe they are all have low standards. ?I mean, how could so many people think so highly of this place? ?Oh, because it has the best (expletive) sushi on the planet. I will admit, I absolutely am a sushi snob. ?I've tried Nobu in New York and Los Angeles, Matsuhisa in LA, Katsuya, and really most of the other highly-regarded sushi restaurants in my travels. ?This place exceeds any sushi I have ever had before. ?The quality of the fish is incredible. ?I did not venture outside of my typical repertoire, so I can only speak for the Salmon, Yellowtail, Mackerel, Salmon Roe, and Eel that I tried, though each piece was spectacular. Long and short; this place has the best sushi I have ever had. ?They are friendly, and it is really really expensive. ?But damn was it good.

Incredible sushi! ?Super fresh fish, well cut, and the rice is perfect. ?Additionally, we sat at the sushi bar and the chefs were nice and put up with our ordering individual pieces at a time. The prices are insane, and so I can't really imagine coming back with any frequency. ?When you you're paying $3-4 for a single bite, it adds up quickly.

Wow. The Omakase is the way to go. I don't know what to say but it's amazing. The sushi is so so so fresh. The rice is vinegared perfectly and they brush a special sauce right on top of the sushi so there is no need to dip. Each piece is perfection. You can ask for additional pieces of what you enjoy the most (of course you pay for it). The service is friendly but aloof and perfect for a catch-up with a friend or a date. The uni hand roll was the most amazing thing. It tasted of the sea but had a slight vinegary sweet tang to the rice topped off with a crisp and fresh piece of nori. Perfection. I cannot wait to go back. Does sushi get better than this? I think not.

It would be stupid of me to tell you I didn't love my lunch here. Therefore, I'm going to do what I usually do, and tell you about something else. I'm going to tell you about how close you came, if you've eaten here, to being attacked by someone who undoubtedly spends her free time as a world-class assassin. I'm speaking, of course, of your waitress. Sure, when you came in you most likely took brief notice of her, smiling politely, but you didn't take the time to really LOOK, did you? You were absorbed in the thought of the kinds of amazing and ridiculously fresh fish you were about to eat. Well, you should have, because that was the last time that you were going to get to see her, since you're now facing the sushi chefs. Once you're seated, the only thing you'll notice of her for the rest of your meal is if she's had a recent manicure. That's right: while you're completely absorbed in the only fish-related orgasm since, I would hope, the time of ancient Greece, you'll suddenly find a slender arm directly over your shoulder, deftly removing or placing things in front of you with extreme pecision, nary a sound, and an economy to her motion that surely indicates foul play. So, Sushi Yasuda: Come for the fish, but keep your guard up.

Tops sushi in the States. ?Had omakase there last night and everything was perfect. ?The fish is extremely fresh, they use the right amount of sauces, and the Uni is sublime. ?I found the staff very pleasant and they have an excellent sake selection to boot. ?The anago, ikura, and well, the Uni again were all standout pieces. ?

Came for a mid-week lunch with a 1:30 reservation. ?We were seated promptly and ordered prix fixe sushi lunch: 5 pieces of sushi and 2 rolls, plus a choice of soup or salad. ? You get to choose the sushi and the rolls from a slightly limited selection of fish, but it is still ample and, today at least, included most of the fish recommended by the chef on the regular menu. ? All the sushi was incredibly fresh and delicious, and at $22.50 - a RIDICULOUS bargain. ?The service was nice, helpful, and efficient. ?The space was ok - pretty standard for sushi places, not much of an ambiance. ?Make a reservation at the sushi counter, if possible. Oh, and ?half way through the lunch, Yoko Ono walked in and was seated at a table right next to ours! ?How about that?

( I'm Japanese and I'm impressed) all sushi chief were Japanese . anything they make is up to japanese standard and this is not your typical sushi restaurant in NYC at all. If you like Americanized sushi (California roll, spicy tuna, boston rolls etc) they don't serve that kind of sushi ....

My Japanese friend recommended this place so I knew it was going to be good. You need to call ahead for reservations and confirm the day before, almost every table is reserved when you walk into the restaurant. Sashimi is by far the freshest I have ever had in NYC. They also have a good variety on the menu. You just can't go wrong no matter what you order. This place is not cheap but it's well worth it. My husband took me to Nobu a few years ago and I thought that place was overrated. I can spend the same amount of money at Sushi Yasuda and enjoy a better meal, a more authentic one! Love it!

There's really nothing that I can say that hasn't already been said! Order the fantastic omakase but prepared to spend a lot of dough. With two people ordering one small bottle of sake and the omakase our bill came to about $220. The sushi is fantastic. The portions are on the smaller side but you are paying for the quality. Our waiter, Taka, was helpful, very polite, and gave us great suggestions on sushi. My favorites were the toro scallion hand roll and the freshwater eel. Be prepared to spend, but this was the best sushi I've ever had!

There's a reason why this place can afford to be closed on a Sunday and close before midnight on a Saturday. I can never eat "cheap" sushi again without feeling like I'm cheating myself out of the amazing sushi as Yasuda. First of all, the decor is awesome. Super sleek and very clean with impeccable service. That alone will keep me coming back for more. Make sure you make reservations, because without them, you won't be eating here. There is no such thing as waiting for a table, they will turn you away. More importantly, the sushi....I can't even put into words how amazingly fresh the fish was and how delicious each and every piece was, but it is definitely to die for. Ihad the Sea Bass appetizer and the sushi and sashimi ?entrees, along with two pieces of Toro. I have never tasted anything like this. Each piece was so full of flavor and so fresh; I couldn't believe my taste buds. I will definitely come back here again. Yes, it's a little pricey, but so worth the price. Between the service and the awesome food, there is no reason why you wouldn't want to come back.

This is quite the freshest sushi I have had to date. The freshness itself gets 5 stars. Anyways, we arrive promptly a little before 8:00 PM for our meal and ask our chef for the omakase. He presents us with the following in this order: Blue Fin Tuna and Big Eye Fatty Tuna Sea Scallop Yellow Tail (Warasa and Shimaaji) Sea Eel (Anago) Bronzino and Striped Bass Shrimp Trigger Fish Sea Urchin (Santa Barbara) Rock Crab Sockeye Salmon, King Salmon (New Zealand), and White King Salmon White Sea Eel and White Freshwater Eel(Sawani and Shirayaki) Spanish Mackerel Salmon Roe Blue Fin Fatty Tuna Our chef expertly adorned our selections when applicable with soy sauce, lemon juice, rock salt, and/or wasabi. Afterwards, he asked us if we wanted any additional pieces and we chose: Sawani (2 pieces), Rock Crab, Sea Urchin, Big Eye Fatty Tuna, and Sea Scallop. I must say this was a 23 piece sushi tour de force. The sea urchin was incredibly fresh, the best I have had yet to date. I was very pleased with this tasting course and the wonderful, attentive service that accompanied it.

Sushi is my favorite food. Sushi Yasuda serves great sushi. By the powers of logic, that should make it one of my all-time favorite restaurants. Unfortunately, the ambiance at Sushi Yasuda kind of sucks. It's a very business-y kind of place, so not great for a date or a night out with friends. Go if you are wearing a business suit. Don't go if you are wearing jeans. Do go for the awesome prix fixe lucnh ($22.50).

I've been here a few times now. I always sit at the sushi bar and order directly from the chefs. Every time, I've had the same experience-- no one on the east coast beats their nigiri. NO ONE. Very traditional style. Extremely fresh fish. Wish they had a better sake selection. Definitely on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for. Service is okay-- could be better. Food quality is definitely a 5! I wish they had ama ebi. why are you always out?WHY?? But service, prices, ambiance combined, 4 stars it is.

This place is amazing. A beautiful, contemporary restaurant with authentic, sushi masters that create beautiful and delicious pieces of some of the best Nigiri & sushi in Manhattan! If you don't want to break your piggy bank, go for lunch and get their lunch specials. You won't get top selection like Uni or Aji, but it will still give you a sense of what wonderful sushi they offer. Their lunch specials (mixed Nigiri/Rolls or Sashimi) range from $23-$30 - a deal for such delicious Sushi. Will definitely return for Omakase next time for dinner. It sounds nothing short of extraordinary. Reservations are highly suggested.

Just brilliant sushi. ?Fantastic selection from basic sushi / sashimi all the way to Torro. ?All the food was super fresh, perfectly prepared and delicious. ?If you are looking for some of the freshest sushi in the States, this is the place to be.

A great, clean Japanese place that serves fresh, simple sushi. But it does give off a slightly sanitized feel that makes it a favorite of the lunch crowd from the elite law firms a few blocks away.

This is really as good as it gets! Came here the other day and sat at the end of the bar being served by a true veteran, chef Yoshi. He's been with Yasuda for over 10 years and is very knowledgeable about fish and sushi as I've asked him a ton of questions throughout the night. Had the sushi omakase and the pieces just kept coming. The tuna, salmon, eels, and different kinds of whitefish were all delectable. If it wasn't for not winning the mega-millions, I would be here at least twice every week.

Very fresh quality fish. Simple, understated ambiance. Fast service. Had the omakase at the counter. I really really really enjoy watching chefs at work (and I probably spend way too much time watching food network). Very fast service - I love how the chef just puts the pieces right in front of you. The scallop pieces were divine - so good we went for seconds. The yellowtail was amazing. The cooked eel was warm and tasty without being overwhelming. The octopus legs looked pretty badass and were pretty good as well. The toro was amazing as always. Even the salmon, such a plain fish, was great. And this was definitely the first time I had an oyster sushi - it was interesting but I prefer them the traditional way. We probably tried over half of the sushi menu. It was that good (or maybe we were that hungry =P). Ended up with over $200 bill for two, but they have some great prix fixe options. We also had a really crisp sake. I forget the name, but the waiter with the mustache said it was his favorite. The one slight downside is that their rolls are mashed fish instead of whole pieces. At least our toro roll was, but still delicious! Oh and the waiter almost spilled soy sauce on me when he was cleaning up.... FYI, if you're the type that doesn't like wasabi, it's helpful to know that the chef puts it into the sushi piece.

I don't live in NYC so I don't have all the experience to compare however I know good sushi from bad sushi and I also know good sushi from AMAZING sushi that sedates you. The latter is the case with Yasuda. Just What the hell? I was in such a drugged up fog from the beauty and taste of the fish but let me see what I remember... I walked in right when the place opened for dinner to see a gillion sushi chefs lining the inside of the sushi bar in which we sat at and which I recommend you make reservations for. I researched the FRIK out of yelp reading tons of reviews for the best authentic real sushi in NYC. I was actually torn between this one and Blue Ribbon which I also plan to visit. I was beyond pleased with the whole experience. I honestly thought I was going to feel pressured because of the time frame they give you for the Omakase. It is also kind of scary that you don't name your price, he just keeps giving it to you until you say you have had enough. Whatever though, swallow that fear and toughen up because this sushi is shipped in fresh from ANGELS. I don't remember much but I do remember some stand outs such as rainbow trout (looked like salmon), giant clam with sea salt was probably my favorite of the night. UGH i wish I had a better memory. Everything was uniquely delicious. After saki and a decent filling of sushi it came to $150 per person after tax and tip which is what I expected from reading the reviews. If you have a big appetite you might leave feeling hungry. This is not a place to gorge. You go here to take in the delicate combination of flavors provided to you by a highly skilled sushi chef. Take your time with each mouthful and really savor the expensive seafood. *siiighhhhh* You know what, I am glad this place is expensive because It is only meant to go to when you really can appreciate it. If you go here all the time then screw you. I probably would too if I had the money! haha

First: THIS IS NOT AS EXPENSIVE as people would have you believe. Second: I've had sushi all over the world and believe this is the best sushi I've ever had (though I've admittedly only been here once). As to point #1 above, I ordered the Sushi Take, which is 8 chef's choice nigiri and a 1/2 roll. This is only $22.50. In my opinion that's super-cheap for that much high-quality sushi. Also, I sat at the sushi bar, as I always do at sushi restaurants. The service was superb. He first gave me 3 sushi pieces, as soon as I finished those 3 more appeared, then as soon as I finished those the last two and my roll appeared. There was also a free amuse-bouche (not sure what you would call it in a sushi restaurant) of diced (cooked) shellfish, seawood and wasabi. Someone else said don't get sake with your sushi ?? Never heard that before but I personally love cold sake with just about anything. The $9 dry cold sake here was very good. Can't remember what it was called. FYI no shochu here. Also appreciated the hot towels both before and after the meal, and the little cold towel they had for use during the meal. Nice.

Sushi quality is 10/10. ?Service is excellent. ?Some of the best sushi I've ever had. Yasuda is a great lunch spot. ?I personally wouldn't come here for dinner. ?Too much of a business atmosphere/clientele. ?Definitely stuffy. ?If you want a fun, young dinner atmosphere with amazing sushi, check out Niko in Soho. ?I would rank that sushi as same quality as Yasuda.

4.5 stars. Over $300 for four people when we ordered omakase for all four, plus miso soup, 8 egg omelette sashimi, a salmon roll, and 4 green tea ice creams. Don't come here if you are just looking for decent but cheap sushi. This is a high quality authentic place. It's definitely a splurge but it was amazing to have such high quality, fresh sushi. The omakase isn't on the menu but it included 4 pieces of sashimi (fish on rice) and 5 pieces of raw fish for each person. I left feeling full but not stuffed (but do you really ever leave a sushi lunch feeling stuffed anyway?). You can taste the quality. My only complaint is that the crab sashimi I had had a piece of shell in it... ?ouch. The acoustics in the restaurant are terrible because you can't hear a word anyone is saying (and the waitress was incredibly soft spoken and had an accent, so we had a difficult time hearing her). Service can be slow, but if you make reservations you can get in and out relatively quickly for a business lunch (1.5 hours). They take great care in changing your plates and bringing out hot green tea when yours turns warm/cold. I thought all the fresh plates were unnecessary but it's a nice touch. I would definitely return. The sushi is amazing. The rice is seasoned perfectly. No need for soy sauce, wasabi, or ginger (though the wasabi and ginger are very fresh as well) here.

There isn't really much point in writing much detail about this place, because everything about it was amazing. It's definitely "high sushi" if I'm allowed to create that term, and the freshness of the seafood is just plain ridiculous. We had the omakase, and every single piece of sushi was amazing in a different way. I'll find it hard to go back to normal sushi! If you don't do omakase, the prices actually look relatively reasonable (still four $s, but at least not outrageous). The omakase with some sake (which will also be amazing) thrown in will cost quite a bit though. If you consider yourself a food fanatic, a sushi snob, or a culinary connoisseur, try this place out at least once!

Fresh azz sushi. ?No gimmicks. ?No special rolls. ?No special sauces. ?Just straight fish from a market, cut by a master, served on plaster. ?No, just kidding. ?Not on plaster, just a plate. ?Probably porcelain though. I don't think I've ever had sushi as fresh, and as delicious as here. ?But I must disclose that because of my budget, I haven't had the chance to go to a place such as here. ?However, after my initial experience, I think I will just forego paying my electricity bill to eat here. They have a great lunch special priced favorably at $24 which comes with two rolls and five sashimi pieces accompanied by a soup/salad. ?I don't think you can go wrong with anything roll/sashimi you choose. ?It seems as though all the fish is fresh and coming straight from the ocean aka Fulton Fish Market. I would come back in a heart beat. ?A very expensive heart beat.

The first time I attempted to come here was with my coworkers. We had a party of 7. I called the guy up and asked if I can make reservations for 7. He said no and that they don't have a table that seats 7. I asked if we can split it in two tables, one 3 people and the other 4. He replies with "No. Ok?" and hangs up on me. I attempted again with just my brother. It was pretty easy to get a reservation the same day. But they said we had to be out by 9 because they had a reservation at 9. Although the fish was really fresh and melts in your mouth, I don't think this place deserves all the hype. I felt a bit rushed the entire time we were there. Moreover, I asked if they marinate their fish and one guy said they do, another guy said no and that they only serve it traditional style. I ordered: omakase sashimi. Yes, the fish melts in your mouth, but if you want somewhere a bit unique and something you have never tried before, I recommend Sushi of Gari. I'm only giving Yasuda 4 stars because of the quality of their fish. I do have to add one detail. This place is listed to be very expensive but it was actually not as bad as I thought. I think Sushi of Gari was pricier, but definitely worth it!!!

** 3.5 stars ** The sixth stop of our Manhattan sushi crawl, and a second visit for me to Sushi Yasuda, a highly regarded sushi restaurant in NYC. ?I had a very disappointing table meal in 2010, primarily affected by the quality of the shari, but since I began dining exclusively at the bar, it was only right to return and experience it in that setting. ?Yasuda-san has since left the restaurant and returned to Japan, but by all accounts, the quality of the work is said to be unchanged. Sushi Yasuda has a bright and open dining room but limited seating, table areas separated by wide spaces. ?The bar is relatively large, seating at least 14 comfortably, with a well-nigh army of sushi chefs manning it. ?Much of the restaurant and the entire bar is bamboo, and its pale, glowing color is ubiquitous throughout. Seating is very strict; reservations are cancelled if you're 10 minutes late, and each seating, whether table or bar, is for 1.5 hours only. ?This time allotment is very tight for omakase, and discourages lingering over dishes or modifying courses. ?Their wait staff were efficient and courteous, smoothing the experience, but because it was rushed compared to other sushi bars, I felt the quickened pace despite the skill of the staff. We slid into comfortable bar seats, selected a carafe of sake to share, a few appetizers, and the sushi omakase. ?They left paper sushi menus with us, where the recommended fish are marked in red ink. ?These are likely the same menus the tables use to order from, and at least on query, they don't seem to offer anything besides what is listed. ?The sushi courses began immediately (again, seemingly a concession to time restriction rather than a deliberate order of serving), interrupted after the third piece for our appetizers. ?The quality of the fish in two of those first three sushi pieces were frankly not fresh, which surprised us. ?The appetizers were fine, although flash fried ankimo was disappointing, the delicate taste of ankimo buried in heavy tempura, a great contrast to the ethereal version served by Azabu. ?Flash fried shrimp fared much better, delicious and well-made. ? After the appetizers were cleared, the sushi omakase promptly resumed. ?Thereafter, the quality of fish and their preparation was flawless. ?Unfortunately, while the shari was much better than my first experience, it remains disappointing, being consistently too cold and not cohesive enough. ?One piece fell apart in half as I picked it up, and almost immediately after the chef placed it before me. ?On the upside, after a bumpy start, the quality of the fish was mostly wonderful, and my favorites included a sublime Santa Barbara uni that is one of the best preparations I've ever had, two new fish (and new favorites): Tasmanian trout and Branzino, and their delicious versions of sawani and anago. As our omakase ended, we asked for a few additions, repeats of our universal three favorites, a vegetable hand roll (the chef-recommended sprouts, crisply refreshing), and a second hand roll, sawani for me. ?And of course, what omakase is complete without me trying house tamago? ?Well-made version but a touch sweeter than I like. ?Our waitress offered dessert and we decided to have green tea ice cream. ?Immediately after ordering, we were asked to move to a table because it was precisely 1.5 hours after our start time, fair given the notification on reserving, and we didn't mind. ?The ice cream was very good, nutty, not too sweet, with red beans on top. Currently, Sushi Yasuda ranks sixth and last of the sushi bar experiences I've had in NYC (15 East, Kurumazushi, Ushiwakamaru, Sushi Zen, Sushi Azabu). ?While considerably better than the table dinner I had some years ago, several issues will keep me from returning. ?First, subpar shari, so vital to proper sushi making and enjoyment. ?Second, to have any unfresh fish at this level is unacceptable. ?And third, a rushed experience; the only way to avoid is to ask for everything you want at the start as I don't doubt the chef will ensure it is served within their 1.5 hr limit, but this takes away from customization, one of the highlights of bar dining. ?And there is something to be said for a restaurant that makes you feel welcome and unrushed; unfortunately, Sushi Yasuda keeps you amply aware of the limit of your stay. Despite some truly exceptional fish, these negatives are enough for me to choose another restaurant. ?I shall miss what I enjoyed the most here, but as I've learned from my sushi crawl, there is excellent sushi to be had in NYC, and enough options that I have no reason to return to Sushi Yasuda.

Do you want top of the line sushi with affordable prices? Then Sushi Yasuda is the place for you! Their prix fix menus are very affordable and a good deal all together. I brought my baby boo here for our 1 monthiversary and it was everything I imagined them being after reading so many reviews on yelp about them. It is a little hard to find as you should know, their signage is a fish and so I was thrown off by that at first (a little embarressing moment in front of her but it's ok ) Reservations are a must, so there is no wait and you will impress your date with your organizational skills as well as being on top of things! lol I suggest also reserving at the bar as that is a whole another experience interacting with the sushi chefs as well as watching them make the sushi fresh! They can serve you right away and there is no need for a middle man/waitress to bring you the food! FOOD: So delicious! You can not deny their freshness in any manner or shape! I ordered a terriyaki fish salmon while my date got one of the sushi prix fix menu types and it wasn't even the omasake! It comes with a fresh and hot miso soup and some pickled vegetables! The sushi comes out in a pack of six and I believe we got like two or three dishes of that! They all were warm, made fresh and the sashimi on top was great! The eel was one of my favorites and they are on top of their craft. ?I ordered the terriyaki salmon and that was delicious as well. It wasn't overly saucy as many places may do and the salmon wasn't dry at all either. I would recommend it as a good stomach filler for many dates not wanting to go all out on sushi! ATMOSPHERE: By far one of THE CLEANEST places I have ever seen. The lobby area is so wide and not stingy at all with its seating. The spacious just provides a clean and chic modern atmosphere. Everything seems to be decked out in a light colored wood paneling and the lighting really brightened the space up bouncing off the wood and accentuating certain restaurant elements! I loved how they took pride in their store and kept true to their personality. Seating isn't a lot because of how they arranged things however, they are on top of the sushi empire and they just have that much customers and raking in money that they can afford that luxury! Some people dress down, but it feels like a nice restaurant where you should dress up a little bit more than you expect so you don't feel out of place! (That's my recommendation) SERVICE: Friendly, nice, and very fobby-japanesey lol. They clean your stuff up constantly and constantly check up on you! Our chef wasn't very talkative as he looked like he just started or was tired from the day which was a downer and almost lost a star for me, however, the chef next to him was peppy, cracked jokes and was very smiley and helped out! So he saved it on service in my opinion! lol. ? SUMMARY: Great sushi! Fresh food! Great Service! Can not go wrong with a date here! Reserve at the bar and remember to dress to impress! : )

When my boyfriend told me he was taking me to Sushi Yasuda, I was extremely excited and spent a good hour reading all of the yelp reviews. The restaurant has a very modern yet traditional feel to it, which I really enjoyed. We started out with salad with ginger dressing. Very simple salad but it had the best ginger dressing I've ever had. I only wished the salad was bigger so I could have had more dressing. We asked our waitor if there was any special sake he'd recommend, and sadly I don't remember what it's called because it was the most amazing sake I ever tasted. We paired it with a bottle of Sapporo and it was perfection. After reading all of the reviews it was clear we had to go with the Omakase. Every piece of fish was amazing, the toro being my favorite. It literally melted in my mouth. My boyfriends favorite fish is eel, so we asked for two different kinds, and we were shocked to see fish that looked almost nothing like the eel you see in most sushi restaurants. I'm not the hugest eel person and I could have eaten piece after piece. We finished the meal with the traditional red bean and green tea ice cream, both of which were delicious. Overall, the sushi was the freshest and most fabulous we had ever eaten. The only negative was it made us question all sushi we had eaten before this. Going back to your regular sushi restaurant would not be easy, although necessary, being that if we dropped $250 every time we craved sushi, we'd be broke!

Yummy! I've always been wanting to try the sushi here and luckily it is M's favorite sushi spot in NYC so we popped over on a recent trip. My mind was blown! We sat at the bar, which I recommend if you're not completely sure what types of sushi you want to try. Our sushi chef Tatsu was extremely nice and friendly, and kept the varieties of sushi coming based on our likes/dislikes. My favorites were the toro, scallop, different types of eel (seared on top), and uni. The toro was absolute melt in your mouth perfection. It tasted like delicious fattiness was mixed in the meat for that buttery texture. Between the two of us, we got six orders of toro (yes, we are fatties!). The uni was the freshest I've had anywhere. The only piece I didn't like from our chef was the clam - it tasted way too brine-y for me. Watching the chefs at work was quite fun as well. Their hands move so fast that it was all a blur. The atmosphere was elegant and clean and the service was excellent. Only slight weird thing was the host at the front desk looked like a member of the yakuza. He was frowning and yelling at the waitstaff from across the room, which really disrupted the classy atmosphere. All in all, I'd love to eat here again and let the sushi chefs spoil me with their personalized picks.

Wowza, I have definitely come a long way from half-priced sushi in St. Marks! Sushi Yasuda was the restaurant of choice for my 1 monthiversary with the wonderful boyfriend of mine :) We were seated at the sushi bar on a Wednesday evening (make sure you specify this when you call to make reservations!) When seated at the bar, you will have your own personal sushi chef. Ours wasn't terribly talkative, but chef next to us did a great job - even getting me a refill of plum vino when he saw my almost empty glass. Sushi Yasuda is surprisingly affordable and filling if you go with their prix fixe sets, with an additional piece of sushi here and there. ?Our prix fixe came with four pieces of sushi & two rolls (6 pieces in each roll). We also had a fish entree to accompany our meal. The meals started off with hearty soup as well as some picked cucumbers; the soup was delicious and authentically Japanese. I don't even need to say anything about the quality of the sushi - top of the line forsure! We also ordered additional pieces of toro (fatty tuna), which absolutely melted in my mouth. The prix fixes are absolutely the best way to go at Sushi Yasuda. Large portions and good prices, and a great alternative to the Omakase. Who knew Sushi Yasuda could be so affordable?

Dinner here was somewhat torpedoed by news of Steve Jobs' death. Consoled by melt-in-your-mouth, (tear-salt) chirashi, a double-scoop of uni, and the empathetic eyes of distant diners in the sparse, simple, cherry-wood dining area, I hoped silently that his rendition of heaven was as softly spectacular, and as quietly perfect.

Dining here changes everything. ?While I would consider myself a sushi lover, it took me 12 years to go to an establishment that would help me understand the complex, subtle flavors and textures of the fish and rice. ?Years of trying out local sushi restaurants and finding some unique, fresh rolls and sashimi is now overshadowed by Sushi Yasuda. At the risk of sounding dramatic, eating here is like putting a new pair of glasses on for the first time. ?There is a sudden rush of excitement and joy followed by understanding. There is no labeled omikase. Rather, the sushi chef will just make sushi for you based on your likes and dislikes until you instruct them to stop. ?You get 1.5 hours to consume dinner, which is more than enough time. ?The wait staff is very particular and will appear omnipresent as they move your plate ever so much, adjust the placement of your cup and refill your drinks. ?While I enjoy this sort of attention to detail, it may put some off who are looking for a more casual meal. ?The sushi is outstanding...Fresh and soft. ?The rice perfectly stuck together with the right hints of vinegar. ?Follow the lead and avoid the extra soy sauce and wasabi. ?The chef has put together his own calculation of the appropriate proportions to please you palate. As one would expect, the assortment of tuna was fantastic. ?The sea urchin, creamy. ?The varieties of eel, melting in your mouth. ?After the first piece you realize what all the buzz is about and you find yourself eagerly awaiting the next experience. ?I recommend one goes to the restaurant either solo or as a couple. ?Make sure your partner appreciates food and life and it will end up being unforgettable. The only drawback is there is no return to normalcy. ?Going forward I cannot be content going to my local favorite. ?I may be the one who now hesitates when the crowd suggests sushi for dinner. ?However, the flipside is I now have an excuse to go to New York and get sushi on a consistent basis.

ordered the sushi + sashimi omakase. the selection was okay, very authentic traditional Japanese sushi, but nothing spectacular. the appetizer (some fried stuff i dont remember) that they served before the meal was cold and tasted like it's been sitting out for a while. didnt get the uni in our omakase, so ordered uni. it was sweet & fresh, but again, nothing that stood out from other high-end sushi places in the city.

This ranks third favorite sushi place in the city, only losing out to Soto and Sushi Azabu. ?Without a doubt going to any of those three for omakase you cannot go wrong.

what we ate- the chef's sushi recommendations came here with my boyfriend and his parents when they were visiting. he and his dad had come once before and absolutely loved it. and this time was no different. we had a nice quiet table and promptly ordered sake. after that we simply asked for the chef's recommendations for sushi and sat back and waited. in short, it was all delicious. some of the best sushi in the city hands down. put at a price tag you might expect which makes it (sadly) a rare indulgence. enjoy!

I thought about it some more this place sucks..... Ok ok the sushi is great, better than great, but our waiter was terrible, he took away our menus by accident and then when we asked for it back he gave us one for three people.... which is fine but at a place where you MUST leave after 1.5 hours you just cant do that.... The waiter seemed like he was doing us a favor by taking our orders separately, sorry to trouble you there..... Its rare that I would make a review wholly bad based on the service but.... here we are. in the end I think you could do just as well for not quite as expensive.... i.e Blue ribbon, where you could prob walk in on the later side without a res rather than deal with some time limit dont have to worry about taking 1.5 hours or anything else..... Id take a sushi snob there but thats about it.....

when you go on the website, one critic review reads, "Sublime" couldn't have said it any better... BondSt used to be one of my fav sushi restaurants (still a hit in my eyes) but this place is levels above Bond.. im so lucky to work near this resto so i can get the prix fixe lunch. 5 pieces of sushi and 2 rolls. ordered the tuna, fluke, otaro (might be wrong on the name but it was another white fish), striped bass, and trout. i favored the tuna, trout, and striped bass in that order for the rolls i got the yellowtail and king salmon. love love LOVEd the yellowtail... cant wait to go back for lunch!

I don't get it. When I came and had the Omakase, I was unimpressed. I'm all about traditional Japanese food (in fact I prefer it to all the nouveau attempts like Gari) but nothing wowed me at Yasuda. The fish for the nigiri, however fresh, was cut in too short and boxy pieces and the rice was overly hard. The service was a hot mess. Sushi bar was okay but waiters and waitresses were whispering in Japanese (which I understand) left and right across the restaurant floor and they all just seemed confused. People kept crowding by the entrance which was not my cup of tea to watch. Also, I'm sorry, but if we're paying bank for your food can you PLEASE get real chopsticks and napkins?! Think of the environment! Just GO TO AZABU.

I have been to Sushi Yasuda twice so far. Once last year and once this year. The first time was courtesy of my boss for job well done so he said he'll give me $200 for me to take anyone I wanted to out for a nice dinner. I knew I had to finally try out Sushi Yasuda. And it was definitely the right choice! Then, I knew I had to come back to celebrate me getting a new job back in April. This is definitely an expensive place because each time I came here, I would end up paying about $300+. This is your normal real Japanese sushi place with a sushi bar and regular seating. The two times we came here. We ordered beer and ordered the Omakase and sat at the sushi bar where the Sushi Chef served us personally. I would recommend sitting at the sushi bar for the true sushi dining experience. He makes any type of sushi and surprises you. Of course you can tell him what you normally don't like and what you do like and he'll start creating stuff based on your taste buds. All the sushi was fresh and amazing! I would recommend having some of the uni and eel. Those are my faves. Of course there was nothing there that we did not like! All the individual pieces are $4 and up, which would explain the total of the bill that you get at the end. For dessert, we had mochi ice cream in green tea flavor. Nice way to end the night! And of course, the bill comes and there was nothing surprising about the bill considering it is known to be an expensive restaurant and to me, it is worth every penny and the experience! If I was rich, I would come here everyday! If you have the money, this is definitely a place to try!

I've created a yelp account today in order to write this review. I've considered Yasuda one of the best sushi restaurants in NY. We had a reservation tonight which marked maybe the 7th or 8th time I've eaten there in the past couple years. There was no problem with the food. The sushi was at the same consistently high standard I've come to expect. The problem was that we were served by one of the rudest servers I've encountered in the entire time I've lived in NY. Our server was very abrupt and rushed considering that the tables around us weren't completely full. She took out menus and tossed them on our table, and she proceeded to walk away from us after we deliberated (for about a second) about whether or not we'd like dessert. When we caught her to ask her for more details about the dessert, her combination of eye rolling and head bobbing meant it was time for us to get the check. Her overall tone, facial expressions and indignant attitude caused us to actually confront her. We literally had to ask "Is there a problem here?". She seemed completely surprised about this, and this obliviousness reflects a poor oversight of the people who've managed her and continue to keep her on staff. I love Yasuda, but tonight I walked away having paid more than $150 and feeling like the quality of food could not make up for the fact that my party and I felt unwanted for the time we ate there. I can understand a person having a bad attitude working at a fast food restaurant, but for the amount of tip a server receives at a restaurant of this quality, you would think that the standard should be, "hey, let's try not to make the customer feel like he should leave immediately." I don't care if a server is having a bad day or a busy section, at this price point I expect a level of professionalism that clearly was not present tonight. I'm sad to write this review because I loved eating at Yasuda, but I'm not sure if I'll be going back to risk spending another fairly large sum of money on another frustrating experience. It's easy for bad service to ruin a brilliant mea

If you're reading this then chances are you're either planning on making reservations, or have been invited for dinner to Sushi Yasuda. Pretty obvious, I know, but just hear me out before you make any rash decisions. Sure, the sushi is delicious, but you can find delicious sushi in many other, much less expensive sushi restaurants. What separates this place? Reputation. It's the cr¨¨me de la cr¨¨me (I love using that) of sushi restaurants in the city, and deservedly so. The atmosphere alone is worth the money (if you have that kind of money to throw away on dinner). It's the type of place you go to if you're trying to impress someone, whether it be a client, your girlfriend, mistress, whoever. Just remember that you'll be paying an arm and a leg for whatever you're hoping to get out of the dinner, and in most cases you'll succeed. When you boil it down, it's just another sushi restaurant. There are mexicans in the kitchen making the non-sushi, Japanese students working the tables, and a few guys behind the sushi bar who can slice sushi and place them on top of a handful of rice. It's delicious, the place is beautiful, and it will get you laid. What more do you want for $120 a person?

Not worth the trip. ?Was met by an extremely rude and rather unreceptive person behind the desk by the entrance door. Alleged he was the manager and kept repeating the same few words, "no table, fully booked," "no table, opentable bookings priority." I proceeded to tell him - see what you can do, I drove all the way from Westchester to try the place out....and again, robot answer..."no table, have opentable customer" "come back another time" "next time book online" How about F/U, idiot!!! I don't care how well reputed the place/food is, once you think your customer doesn't really matter you're finished in any smart customer's book. This is NYC, there are way too many places here to waste time with a "too good for your business" venue. I went to Shimizu instead, the place was many times better. Period!

Was visiting nyc for the first time and wanted to splurge a bit on good sushi...so i made my reservation 1 week ahead and came here on a Thursday for lunch. We had a la cart sashimis. I think my fav was the scallop. Everything else weren't very impressive. Portions are tiny...for the price paid I could've gotten much bigger and fresher (in my opinion) pieces at my fav sushi restaurant in the bay area. I wonder if I should've just opted for the bento boxes.

Oh hell yeah. ?Best sushi I've ever had as of the date of this review. ?Four words: Omakase at the bar. ?This was everything I had hoped and dreamed of sushi in an American coastal city known for sushi. Every single thing was excellent. ?I asked for nothing with Roe, nothing with Uni and no Sashimi. ?Straight up nigiri and nothin but. ?It was perfect. ?Every single thing. ?Excellent temperature, texture, freshness, balance of rice to wasabi and fish. ?Excellent service. ? I had a minor cold and was slightly congested. ?I had to keep getting up to go to the bathroom to blow my nose because I didn't want to miss a single flavor. ?It felt wrong to blow my nose at the bar. ?Every time I stood up, the waitstaff pulled my chair back for me. ?Every time I sat down - same thing. ?Military discipline in the waitstaff. I don't know which chef I had but he was awesome. ?He crafted my nigiri with incredible delicacy and finesse. I'm not really that big a fan of Manhattan or NYC. ?I'm spoiled because I'm from the greatest city on earth so NYC doesn't do much for me but this place singlehandedly made this trip all worth while and even made me a little envious that I haven't found a place as masterful in quality as this in Chicago (or anywhere so far). ?I'll have to explore more sushi spots when I'm in town again.

Great Sushi!! We had the omakase and were not disappointed. We didn't sit at the bar but still had a great assortment of fish. The highlights were the sweet shrimp, the king salmon, the blue fin tuna and the trout. The served a lot of the sushi with coarse salt which was a nice change from soy sauce. We also enjoyed the sea urchin hand roll and sushi - the waiter was so excited that we like sea urchin! The service was great but a bit too fast. As we were finishing one course the next course was already on the table. We would definitely go back.

I would have to say that I expect a little bit more. Food was great for sure. I liked everything. The place is very clean, services was really good, food was so fresh, and it wasn't THAT expensive like some other reviews said. My waiter did took a wrong oder from me which I ordered Tako sashimi and he gave me oyster sashimi. I didn't really mind 'cause i like oyster too, and it turned out to be a wonderful mistake. The oyster sashimi was so fresh~!! I love it, love it, love it. I might not go anytime soon again because after all it is just a sushi place, nothing too special about it expect they have high quality of seafood.

After living in NYC for over a year now, i finally got a chance to try Sushi Yasuda(supposely the best sushi in NYC). I would have have been here a few times before hand but each time I call in, I got that RUDE guy who take care of all of the reservation. He act like he doesn't care if you come in or not and if you do come in, he can fit you in a time slot but you have to be out in a 1 1/2hr. This time I just swallow my pride and say yes LOL w/out wanted to talk back to him. We got there on time and got seated right away, we order the eels sprine for the appetizer and the rest of the things were ordering all sushi/sashimi. Eels sprine-it was goot and tasty and I can eat this like a bag of chip Sushi- we pick all of the usual sushi and the one that we like(uni, amber jack, all different types of mackerel, giant clams, etc). The sushi was good but nothing like people rave about and it isn't the best sushi that I ever had so a little disappointed. We keep ordering more but my guest wasn't happy so I just ate by myself. Mostly all handrolls w/different types of fish. Overall this was a ok experience for me, the price is extremely expensive and I was still hungry. I don't really eat much but I had to go to a burger joint afterward. The bill came out to $200 buck and the time we ate was under 1 hr. WOW, this is the shortest amount of time for a nice restaurant. Would I go here again, nope...I rather save my money and go somewhere else to try. The best piece of sushi that i had in NYC has to be at 15 EAST and they have a sushi called iwashi= horsemackerel.....i can eat that forever!!!

I think Yasuda is good but not great. Lunch is a bargain if you order the lunch specials. Let's face it though, you are not coming to Yasuda for an inexpensive meal. The Uni from Santa Barbara was delicious and quite fresh. I actually enjoyed the SB Uni better than Hokkaido, which is unusual since I lived in Sapporo two winters ago. The Aji and Pacific Salmon were very fresh and tasty. The miso is good but not amazing. The scallop/hotate were excellent too. The sushi rice is excellent every time I eat here. I think the Omakase is the way to go, even if you can navigate through the menu. The offerings in general are creative and unique vs. other sushi shops. I think the reservation system is antiquated. There should be a way to circumnavigate the announcement. I think the days for attitude at a sushi shop are over. Overall, the sushi is very fresh and there are fish here you do not get in many other restaurants. I think there needs to be some creative juices or objective taste buds from Yasuda sans staff. If I compare this to Sushi Jiro in Tokyo you would never rush to eat here.

Yasuda has been the closest experience to sushi in Japan outside of Japan that I have encountered thus far. The rice is exceptional and, although it should go without saying at this point, so is the quality of the fish. As some of the prior reviews have stated, this is not your fancy schmancy Manhattan establishment. Dress nicely - upscale casual - but Yasuda is not the place to show off your new Louboutins. If you prefer style over substance, there are less pricey alternatives that can spare you from the atrocities of Midtown. Let me follow this review with a few sentences of oh-my-god-I'm-so-wonderful. After reading, most of you will want me to trip and fall on an HIV needle but no worries, all self-praising rants will all be over in 1 (update: 2) swift paragraph(s). *clears throat* I lived in Tokyo long enough to stop considering ___ (insert just about every USA-based Japanese restaurant name here) to be anything other than a bastardized American version of Japanese cuisine. When you have grown accustomed to eating sushi/sashimi in the sushi/sashimi capital of the world (therefor universe!), you (i.e. me) will undoubtedly notice yourself scrunching up your nose or rolling your eyes when someone starts telling you just how awesome that Japanese takeout was and ohmygod Nobu was so good..... ew (author pauses to shudder at the horror of it all). Meaning- when I give Yasuda a five star rating it is not because I am not familiar with sushi. I am, in fact, perhaps too familiar with sushi. In Tokyo, a person can walk outside of their door and nibble on something aquatic about 2.5 seconds after it was bonked on the head with a blunt object or gutted with a knife. No, dinner at Yasuda is not the same as breakfast at the Tsukiji fish market. If you want your tastebuds to encounter that uniquely Japanese experience you are going to have to book the flight to Narita and wake up at 4am to get it. Expecting anything similar outside of Japan is, simply put, delusional. Rant over.

I always have an excellent meal at Yasuda. ?Always sit at the bar if you can, it's so fun to watch them making the sushi and is also the traditional way to eat it. I think the rice at Yasuda is probably the best of anywhere in NYC. ?Truly a highlight for a sushi snob. ?The service will be fast and efficient, bordering a little on rushed, but not to the point where it is bothersome. ?Definitely has more of a commercial feel. One thing I don't get is that they slather on this slightly sweet soy-based sauce onto every piece of sushi. ?While it is good of course, and I have encountered it at many other sushi restaurants in both the US and Japan, I think this is cheating as there are some cuts of fish that really shouldn't need it, but should be served plain, salted, or with a small amount of sea salt + yuzu or other garnish. ?Last time I went for lunch, literally everything I ordered had this sauce (which I didn't order) on it, so I'm deducting 1 star from an otherwise 4 star rating (the highest I've given to any NYC sushiya to date). PS Don't be afraid to use your hands!

Best sushi I have ever had in the States: West coast, Midwest, East Coast. No contest. The last time we were here, Yasuda was still behind the sushi bar. He entertained us with his usual, haughty take on seafood and then proceeded to barate an Italian chef sitting by the bar for rudely not finishing a whole nigiri. Get the omakase. None of the chefs will fail to disappoint you. The fish is freshly cut per tradition and if you want ?a treat: toro toro TORO.

I've been a regular for the past 8 years and dorky enough to have the sushi yasuda dukedom, so I figured it was time for me to finally write a review of yasuda. It's definitely the expense account crowd, but I'd gladly pay the $100++ per head (pre booze) for this swimmingly fabulous fish. ?As an FYI, I've probably been here more than 100 times for lunch but only once for dinner, so I can't comment so much about the evening experience. ?Does it deserve the ny times 3 stars and all the accolades of best sushi in NYC - yes yes yes!! ? Btw I have reviewed Sasabune and I also call it my fave sushi. ? It's a different experience and the decor at Sasabune is terrible. ?From a presentation and purity of fish experience, sushi yasuda is simply the best. ?All pieces are perfectly delicately made. ?No pieces aren't big so don't expect gargantuan portions. ?And don't expect california roll. Sushi yasuda is about the cut and simplicity of the of sushi and sashimi. There are some cooked choices but eating at yasuda is similar to taking a vegetarian to a steak restaurant. ?Not a great idea. ? ? The room is an inviting very simple light wooden interior. ?If you are just two, sushi bar is the only way to go. ?You still get a wonderful and attentive experience at a table, but the interaction with the chef is really unique and fun at the sushi bar. ?Also if you are fortunate enough to do sushi bar, omakase (chefs choice) all the way! If you are sitting at a table, order by the piece with the paper sheet. ?The best fish of the day is always circled, so it's best to stick with those choices. ?Although I am always a sucker for the toro scallion roll. ?And I am a uni lover no matter what! ?I would probably say omakase is less desirable at a table because the chef is not serving you by the piece. ?Service is very good and you will always see servers scurrying to clear plates, describe your order (note English speaking skills are low) and refill tea/ drinks. ? Reservation policy is strict. ?This is not an http://opentable.com restaurant. ?You have to call and get a 3 digit number and then confirm that day or risk - sol. Also lunch is a strict 12 or 130 (dinner probably has 2 or 3 specific seatings as well).

Oh My God. Excuse me while I close my eyes and drool at the thought of Sushi Yasuda. I first came here in 2009, and have been going back everytime I'm in NY (from LA). Do yourself a favor and definitely make the time and save the money to try this place. Most of the time I go to Sushi Yasuda I get the Omakase, which is a very very expensive option if your nickname growing up was "bottomless pit." But everytime I go to NY, I ration off a small percentage of my paychecks leading up to the trip just so I don't ever feel limited. The price for a standard sushi piece is about $4-5, which might sound normal, but that's the price for ONE piece. Still it's worth every bit. Generally for omakase the chef asks you if there are any fish you're not particularly fond of, and then starts the show. The first time I went, the chef prepared "3 ways" (don't flag me) for various fish. Salmon 3 ways (alaskan, white, new zealand), clams 3 ways, eel 3 ways, etc. It was such a great experience to try the different types of one single fish from different regions, or cooked in different ways. It's seriously enlightening. Each time I get the Omakase, depending on who I go with and how hungry we are, it ranges from $250-400 (2 people). That's not including any alcohol or drinks. The price might seem steep, or reasonable depending on where you've frequented for your sushi experiences, but regardless the trip is worth it.

Another absolutely amazing experience here. ?This is the first time that I've experienced the bar experience here at Yasuda and I loved it. ?The bf ate almost everything on the recommended a la carte menu and the chef took us on an amazing sushi experience. ?I think one of my favorite aspects about the omakese here is that the chefs will give you 2 types of the same type of fish to try together so you can taste the difference between them. ?For example, for most sushi restaurants when you order omakese, the meal will usually end with one type of eel. ?Here the chefs give you a fresh water eel and a sea eel. ?We had 2 types of yellow tail, fatty tuna, many different types of salmon and trout, and the list goes on and on. ?Eating at the bar for omakese beats table omakese anytime!

I've heard about this place as having the best sushi in NYC. When a special occasion came up, the bf and I decided to go. We were a little intimidated before going. They said we only had 90 minutes, and they said absolutely don't be late, and to confirm the reservation in the morning. It sounded like the sushi nazi. This place is easy to miss. It doesn't say Yasuda anywhere -- the awning just has a tiny fish on it. We came 10 minutes early and were seated promptly. We were clueless about ordering, so we decided to get the following: --Pickled vegetable appetizer -- really good, tangy/sour --They also brought us a tiny radish salad on the house -- the 2 bites were tasty --We each got the $36 sushi tasting...and let the chef decide the selection. It came with 12 pieces of sushi (fish on top of rice) and 3 pieces of a roll. The selection included tuna, salmon, branzino, oyster, shrimp, whitefish, roe...and some other stuff. The fish is amazing quality...the fillet ones are almost buttery and melt in your mouth. --green tea mochi ice cream for dessert The bill came to $95 and we left not super full, but not hungry. We just drank tap water. I can see how it would be really easy to rack up a $200 bill. We're not big eaters and didn't drink. This place is definitely worth going to if you can afford it.

So good, so, soooo good. We walked right in without a reservation years ago, like 3 years ago...so I wonder how it is now? Screw the fancy smanchy Nobu & Megu and opt for the ultra low key, yet freshest fish ever here at Sushi Yasuda. I love the interaction with the sushi chef and how everything is served on Banana leaves. Very cool touch, makes it feel even more authentic...although I thought Banana leaves were from for forest-filled parts of Asian, not Japan...but I'll take it. By far one of my favorite sushi spots in the city.

Best sushi I've had in the city. ?Some tips: - When you make a reservation, you need to specify that you want to sit at the bar. ?If you dont, you'll get seated at a table, and then express yelp-rage at being seated at a table. ?If you snag a rez at the bar, note that you'll be told when you have to show up and when you have to leave, and they'll remind you that your time is almost up. ?Be warned and be on time. - You dont have to get omakase. ?I went with a Yasuda veteran, and he suggested we order straight off the menu. ?And we did, and we ordered everything on the omakase menu (we were comparing against the people seated around us, who did in fact order omakase), plus more stuff we wanted to try out. ?The cost was comparable if not better, considering how much food we got. - Talk to the chefs. ?They may not appear friendly but that are extremely knowledgeable and will not lead you astray. - You eat this sushi with your hands. ?If you sit at the bar, there will be a small tray with a vertically positioned wet white towel. ?You wipe your thumb and index finger on this after each dish. ?No one is impressed if you know how to use chopsticks - eating with your hands is the right way. - Do not use soy sauce or wasabi unless the sushi chef recommends. ?Trust me, they notice. ?And they'll tell you when a particular piece needs additional soy sauce. ?Note that some of the sushi pieces have the right amount of wasabi already included - dont be dunking your fish in wasabi soy sauce. ?Save that for the regular places. - Try at least one hand roll. ?The seaweed here is very different than at other places, and ask the chefs what makes the seaweed so special. - When in doubt, order both. ?Or ask which one to order. Enjoy!

I brought my bf here to celebrate our anniversary. It was between here and Sushi of Gari. I chose this because the reservation time availability was closest to what I wanted. We did the omakase which should be noted that the chef simply gives you pieces of sushi to try until you say you are done. We opted for the sushi omakase because of their reputation for the rice. I have to say, the pieces we received were really good. Several pieces to try is the Spanish Mackerel, King Salmon, Calm, Uni, Tuna, Eel, etc. I loved the our sushi chef because he would serve us two different types of fishes next to each other so we can compare the depths of flavors. I tried not to use the soy sauce too much because it cuts the freshness of the fish. Each piece is dabbed with wasabi and with fish that fresh, I highly doubt the wasabi was needed. We also shared a mildly dry sake served cold and that was pretty good. Our damage only came out to be 230 which was not bad at all considering all the pieces we had. Make sure you only order one hand roll because they squish/ground the fish together for the rolls and you cannot tell the different between each rolls. Also, their dessert menu is very limited. I wanted the green tea crepe cake and they only offere I can't wait to try Sushi of Gari for the comparison.

The last dinner I had during a vacation in Japan was at a tiny sushi bar deep in Tokyo's Roppongi district, hand-picked by the family of my cousin's Japanese wife. We were the only customers that night. The chef was an artist in continual motion, his raw material culled from Tsukiji Market mere hours before. His nigiri: poetry itself. Fireworks exploded behind my eyes the entire time, testament to the meal's stunning quality. Yet still, it could not erase Sushi Yasuda from my mind. Almost 30 years of eating memories I have built up, many of them in the NYC area. Countless exceptional moments. But no single restaurant meal has had more of an effect on me than the omakase I had from chef Yasuda-san himself in 2004. True, before then, programmed by my Filipino genes, I enjoyed eating immensely. But after the meal, food became the keenest of all my obsessions. That is what one perfect hour can do. In the seven years since, I'd been back to Yasuda but once, escorting one very special lady there for lunch in 2007. We didn't really talk about it afterwards -- my only clue to her opinion is that to this day her Yelp profile lists Sushi Yasuda as her designated "last meal on Earth". When I heard this past winter that Yasuda-san had decided to return to Japan, my breath caught in my throat. "Sushi Yasuda" would march on under a trusted lieutenant, but how could it ever be the same? I needed to know. I would give the sushiya several months to complete the transition. Then I would return to pit it against the virtually invincible fortress of my memories. Now: a beautiful summer day. Textured paper in the windows was new; otherwise, all was the same as four years prior. I sat at the counter. The young chef before me, Tatsuya Sekiguchi, gave me a plate with pickled ginger on it. I popped a slice in my mouth, just as a palate cleanser. And I realized instantly that I had made a mistake. Understand, everything at Yasuda is made from scratch, from the grated wasabi to the soy sauce. The ginger vanished on my tongue, releasing its crisp flavor like a water balloon popping. My God! Even the ginger was breathtaking! No wonder I'd been reluctant to return -- even my 2007 visit had been more of a lark than premeditation. The place was a temple to sushi, a sanctum sanctorum that should not be breached lightly. How had I forgotten? I wanted to get up, say, "I'm sorry, I have to wait for a life-changing experience to come back, I don't deserve this right now," bow in deepest apology. But Tatsu-san smiled warmly at me, seeming to detect that amongst the businessmen and Japanese expats at the counter, I was the one who felt most privileged to be there. "You have been here before?" he said. "Not in years." "I hope you enjoy." It felt like an absolution. My panic subsided. I settled on a simple lunch special, carefully cross-referencing my choices for five nigiri pieces and two rolls with the several hand-marked chef's-picks for fish of the day. "I can add a piece of kinmedai, right?" I asked. Tatsu-san smiled again, this time with his eyes. "Yes, yes!" His youthful looks belied the brisk assurance of his movements. It seemed like only seconds passed before he was placing each delicate, glistening morsel in front of me. "Fluke. Orata. Orange clam..." I don't remember my exact order. It doesn't matter. When I put the first piece in my mouth, a cadence sounded in my head, and the world dissolved away. It was like some positive form of PTSD, my food life flashing before my eyes. Eating baconsilog at the kitchen table in my childhood home, tree-filtered sunlight angling into the room like a scene from a Malick film. Showing my college sweetheart how to squeeze every last drop of flavor out of a lobster, pleasure thrumming through every cubic centimeter of her being as she scooped at its head. Curating a co-workers' trip to Flushing, the joy of discovering xiao long bao flickering onto each of their faces like so many fireflies. When I came to, Tatsu-san was smiling at me yet again. "Is it OK?" he asked. You want evocations of the food itself? Forget it. That is beyond my ken. But know this: the ridiculous variety of fish is a red herring. Who chooses eateries by menu length? Even its freshness is beside the point. No, Sushi Yasuda's claim to the firmament is its incredible rice -- a thunderclap that has not lost a decibel in the absence of its founding chef. To order sashimi would be to forfeit a glimpse into eternity. Maybe this hasn't been much of a review, per se; maybe it's just me sobbing into my keyboard. But if you care about food... if you care about anything... before shuffling off this mortal coil you owe it to yourself to come here. Probability of return within 1 year, or 10: impossible to calculate. Come back after a "life-changing experience"? Sushi Yasuda IS a life-changing experience. The next woman I bring there will be one I intend to spend the rest of my life with.

Great sushi and sashimi. ? I have to say I came here with very very high expectations, as one of my foodie friends said that this place had the "best sushi in the United States." ?I have always taken the food opinions of this friend very seriously. My wife and I had both their regular menu items and some high end items. ?The fish was all very very good and fresh - although sadly, not the best I've had in the U.S. ?The toro was not as rich as some I've had, although toro really varies from fish to fish sometimes. My biggest complaint about the meal was all of the rice was overcooked. ?Whether it be the bowl of rice or the sushi nigiri, the rice was all overdone... On the other hand, maybe the whole dining experience here was ruined by the girl sitting next to us who was clearly on a first date and who could not stop talking about herself because she wanted to sound interesting. ?It's hard to think about your food when your neighbor is talking so loud about her food and everything outside of the restaurant... Conclusion - maybe this was just a bad night. ?However, the people here clealry take their fish very seriously, so it is hard to imagine that you can go wrong by coming here.

After much research and deliberation we decided on Yasuda for a birthday sushi bonanza. ?I'd been there many times before, during the Yasuda era; this would be my first visit without the infamous oyaji in house. The quality of the fish and rice was certainly on par with my previous visits for all intents and purposes. ?Yasuda's multifaceted eel preparations have always been the main draw for me; we ordered several pieces of each of the five available eel accordingly, and they were all spot on. ?Other highlights were the uni and the littleneck clam; Yasuda always had a way with shellfish, and this unique strength seems to have been preserved. ? All that said, we had a disturbing issue with our server that necessitated a chat with the manager. ?Maybe she was having a bad night, but this particular server was outright rude to us from the moment we were seated. ?Now our priority when dining out is always the food, but in this case, the server's horrible attitude made our dining experience truly awkward and uncomfortable--two sensations you never want to feel when you're ready to drop $100 per person. ? We were ready to leave--and probably would have if it wasn't for the promise of Yasuda-grade sushi. Thankfully, the manager sent in another member of his staff, relief pitcher style, salvaging our dinner. They must have felt pretty bad about the service because at the end of the meal they brought out a plate of fresh fruit and sang a table side rendition of happy birthday in Benihana-esque fashion. ?I never saw that one coming at Sushi Yasuda. Although the sushi was very good, the total experience was generally disappointing. ?In retrospect, the restaurant evokes an aging geisha, well versed in the classic arts, but past her prime...look closely and you'll see the hem of her kimono is frayed. ? For me at least, the sun has set on the era of Sushi Yasuda.

My respect for this place is a 5, the opinion of my taste buds are at a 2 or 3...I guess I'm not used to the super authentic sushi. And as much as I love sushi, I understand that I'm not on level with the hardcore super pure and high end sushi places... If you are, go to this place, its top quality and super super super authentic. If you like sushi and eat good quality sushi ( i dont eat at the places that are $2 a roll lol), that is a slight by americanized, I'm not sure this place is right for you. You will wonder why you're paying so much for sushi and why you don't like it as much as some other places...its because it's super pure and authentic.

Wow. This place is quite expensive, even compared to the sushi I just had back in Tokyo. On other Yelp reviews, I have seen dinner bills soar past $400, and while I only had a few pieces with my friend, my lunch bill exceeded $80. Note that I had a sushi lunch at Tsukiji Market in Tokyo, and even with the dollar being at its weakest point against the Yen in 20 some-years, my bill only reached around $50. On to the good points: the wasabi was actually authentic, coming from grated wasabi root. -The chef carved out each piece from what looked to be immaculate piece of fish. Truly the best sushi I've had in Manhattan to date. -Service was impeccable at the sushi bar area. although the restaurant was bustling we still managed to be in and out in a reasonable amount time. Is this restaurant worth the price that it charges? If you are a sushi fanatic, I would give it an unreserved yes. Clean, fresh, and exquisitely presented sushi.

Consistently the best sushi I've ever had. But try the hot appitizers too, theyr'e always a good surprise. And while it's probably more expensive than your average sushi dinner, it's not by much, and it's well worth the price. If I lived a little closer, this might end up as my regular sushi spot. Maybe it was just because I was a tourist and didn't know where to go, but I was unable to find better sushi in Japan. And I tried. Hard.

Critics have it right on this one -- Yasuda definitely out-classes every sushi restaurant in town when it come to the singular focus on sushi. ?fish so fresh, so seasonally appropriate, so perfectly cut that it goes down in one swift single bite. ?sushi rice, cooked to perfection, a culinary art in its own right, a perfect companion to masterfully cut fish. ? This is a temple of sushi and you go for the celebration and enjoyment of it, nothing else really. ?There is no wine list. ?There is no sake list, just a handful of selection of drinkable stuff. ?there is kirin beer by the draft and couple of other beers. ?that's it! ?go to Masa if you want a deep wine and sake list and a willingness to drain a suitcase full of cash but even Masa (nor Karuma Zushi) compares to Yasuda when it comes to the pure enjoyment of sushi, in my humble opinion.

I knew this place was amazing, but I did not realize how amazing until my recent trip to NYC. ?Chef Yasuda was away in Japan so we opted to try another restaurant. ?Little did I know the error of my ways. Sitting at the sushi bar and being served by Chef Yasuda was a rare treat. ?When first seated, we were informed he does not offer omakase ("It's up to you"). ?This surprised me as many Japanese restaurants feature the idea of omakase. ?He then gave us the menu of currently-offered items and asked us to let him know what we wanted. ? After finishing the initial order and conversing with him about the seafood and the rice, he said he would do omakase for us. ?Score! ?I guess we said the right things. ?(= ?What followed was some of the most heavenly food you could put in your mouth. ?The rice and the fish, both succulent and hedonistic, made me wish I had made a second reservation that week. ? I also want to comment on another diner at the sushi bar that evening who I don't think I'll ever forget. ?He enjoyed each piece of food like it was the first time he had ever eaten. ?It was written all over his face. ?It was great to witness someone able to exhibit this kind of excitement about a basic necessity of life. ? I am convinced Chef Yasuda played a role in this man's enjoyment. ?Sushi Yasuda, I will not doubt you again. ?I will merely dream of your tasty morsels until my next trip.

I've died and gone to heaven. I'm just sad I never had the chance to experience this omakase while Chef Yasuda was still here. This is no Americanized sushi. You can actually taste and see the difference in the quality and skills. The rice was perfectly seasoned and the fish - incredibly fresh. You eat with your hands, the traditional way. No soy sauce needed - it's already been brushed with the appropriate amount. Wasabi used sparingly. Notable bites: * Tempura Matcha Prawns - very tender. suck the heads! * Oyster sushi - Freshly shucked, plump & juicy, with coarse salt sprinkled on top. * Toro - Melts on contact. Seriously. * Uni hand roll - Soft and sweet. I wish I could have had this on sushi as well. * Rock crab sushi - Sweet, flaky, and a bit briny. * Sweet shrimp - Ama ebi is quickly becoming one of my faves. The flavor is mellow with a sweet aftertaste. I'm drooling just thinking back on that meal.

Yasuda is an excellent place to have fine, traditional Japanese sushi. I ordered sushi omakase for dinner and various kind of fishes were served. Among those, I especially enjoyed anago, uni and ikura. Anago was served pairing with unagi as a comparison for you to tell the difference between saltwater eel and fresh water eel. Both eels were very fresh and had very delicate texture, but I enjoyed the flavor of anago better. Uni sushi and ikura sushi were perfect too. First, they were served at the exact temperature, reminding me the temperature of the sea - cool and refreshing. Second, they were so fresh. The uni was from Santa Babara, a famous uni port, and it was sweet and juicy. It was so fresh that it didn't leave a fishy aftertaste in your mouth after you swallowed it. For ikura, I normally do not enjoy it because a lot of restaurants couldn't handle it well - they marinate ikura to reduce the fishy flavor. As a result, ikura was salty and fishy. However, in Yasuda, since their ikura was so fresh that the chef served it without marinating it. When I chewed the ikura sushi in my mouth, the cool salmon eggs bursted in my mouth all together. It feels like I was drinking the sea water - so fresh and clean, with a mild pleasant fish flavor. Overall, I enjoyed the dining experience in Yasuda. I would go back again.

This place has magic water glasses that never get below half full. Also magical were the pillowy bite size morsels of fresh fish that were served on top of just the right amount of rice. As some others have mentioned, very similar to a Japanese experience except they speak English here! Sit at the bar and order the omakase. Then eye other people's food and if you don't get something that you see going to another table, order that too!

Who are these people only giving Yasuda 4 stars? There isn't anything better than this out there in sushi, and possibly in the world as a whole. It's just perfection. To those who say it wasn't as impressive their second visit, this place's consistency is probably exactly what failed you the second time: your mind can only be truly blown by something this pure once. But it's still worth going back again and again. It's like chasing your first perfect trip.... you'll never get there, but you'll have fun trying.

Had the Omakase here, nothing to rave about. I think if you want better sushi, u should try blue ribbon. The price is your typical omakase price, however the fish was nothing special. I eat sushi at least once a week and being from Vancouver, know what good sushi should taste like, and although the fish was not bad at all, it was not worth the price that I paid. Not recommended!

A sushi restaurant so good it got me to sign up for Yelp after many years of browsing. The omakase was spectacular, the service perfectly Japanese, and the decor completely appropriate but not ostentatious. I did not sit at the bar for omakase so I will have to go back and get that experience. Food: The sushi here made me regret all sushi I had previously purchased. The fish was so fresh and flavorful, perfectly prepared, on top of the best rice I have ever eaten in my life. Every piece was a revelation. Favorites included: sea scallop, uni, and saltwater eel. Also had a bottle of seasonal cold sake whose name I've unfortunately gotten that was perfectly dry but with a nice tang. Service: Quality service, highly attentive but not overbearing. Slight errors in sushi identification were quickly rectified Decor: Simple, plain, clean, Japanese.

Had a delicious meal here. After originally being recommended to sit at the sushi bar by a friend, we ended up sitting at a table just to facilitate some easier conversation (the hosts were very gracious and helpful in making the change). Not sure if that was the right call, but it worked out well either way. I had been warned that the cost at this place can add up, but I actually found it fairly reasonable when making use of a couple of the very reasonable combination specials. The $36 sushi matsu special got us 12 pieces of sushi and half a roll, and the $24 sashimi take special added anotehr 5 pieces of sashimi. After a confusing experience with the not-exactly-fluent-in-english waiter, we figured out that we needed to mark down our choices from a custom list on a sheet of paper. Not being sushi afficionadas, we tried a wide variety of items, and they were all pretty great. The octopus and oyster stood out as things I dont normally taste at sushi joints, but worked very well. The food was delivered promptly, with the waiter giving us inside tips on when to use wasabi, and when to use soy sauce. The meal was rounded out nicely with a green tea mochi. Total cost came to about $40 pp with a drink each. Only negative (why its losing a star) is that we were told to leave the restaurant promptly at 11.30. I've closed out a lot of restaurants on weekdays in the city (one of the pitfalls of working in finance is late dinners), and the staff is invariably patient and courteous. Usually we end up leaving of our own accord because we feel bad. While being told to leave is not the end of the world (we had already finished eating), it definitely leaves you with a bit of a bitter taste in your mouth (a shame after all the delicious food!)

No doubt the fish here is extremely fresh and of the highest quality. We did have to wait to get our seats (we sat at the bar, so somewhat understandable). I took off a star because the chef ran out ideas for omakase and just asked us if there was anything else we wanted to try or retry, which defeats the purpose of doing omakase. I definitely would give this a try if you love great sushi, but this is definitely not my favorite in NYC.

Disclaimer: I am not a big fan of Sushi so my review might be biased. The whole experience starting from making a reservation was weird. My colleague called in on a Tuesday to make a reservation for Friday lunch. He was told to expect a ?call Friday morning between 9-10 to confirm the reservation and if no one answered the phone the reservation would be canceled. So my colleague stood by the phone as if life depended on it. The 9 am called came, with a warning that the reservation would be canceled if we were more than 5 mins late. So like good students we were there on time. We were greeted by a gentlemen who spoke politely but the kind of person who you wouldn't want to mess around with. Had the aura of a ninja. The food was 2-3 notches fresher compared to a normal sushi joint. Even the soy sauce and wasabi had a clear difference. I get why this place is rated so high. Is it the most pleasurable sushi experience for me? Not really. But then again I am not a sushi expert. Its definitely worth a try. A bit pricey though.

I love Sushi Yasuda. As everyone will tell you, the sushi is the absolute best in New York. And up until yesterday it would have kept the five stars it had in my heart were it not for their arrogance and sloppiness. First, the arrogance. Sushi Yasuda has always been a bit *particular* about reservations, ordering, time alloted to eat, etc. I was happy to play along because it was a bit like the "Soup Nazi" from Seinfeld and the food was worth it. But when I arrived yesterday they changed my reservation from the bar to a table and insisted that I had told them to do so (I didn't). After trying to discuss it with them, they basically said you can take the table or leave. If i didn't already know how good the food was, I probably would have left, but I took the table. Although it was their fault, they refused to admit their mistake and absolutely refused to offer any kind of accommodation. Sushi Yasuda is good and they know it, but it's made them so arrogant that they do not care how their customers are treated. Second, the sloppiness. The rice is still worthy of the Yasuda name, but the rolls I ordered were not prepared properly: misshapen and falling apart. This would not have been acceptable if Yasuda-san were still in charge and combined with my complaint above it seems obvious that the restaurant has lost its touch. I hope they get back to the level of quality and precision (both in taking reservations and preparing the food) that made the place exceptional when Yasuda-san was still behind the bar.

Easy to sum up: Pretentious, terribly curt service, incredible fish. ?The decor is beautiful but like the rest of the experience, sterile. Not a "fun" experience, and not for big groups, but the fish and the rice is the best I've had. ?I didn't venture to try the cooked dishes (I think the eel backbone is supposed to be great). ? Full disclosure, I haven't been there since Yasuda left. ? If you're looking for something more relaxed and less pretentious with excellent fish, do Gari or Seki. ?Kanoyama and Sushi Azabu downtown are also excellent. ?If you want something less expensive with many types of fish, I like Blue Ribbon at Columbus Circle (though the rice and service can be variable). ?If you're a tourist and want something trendy, go somewhere big and exciting and fusiony with a bar like Morimoto or Nobu.

Hands down, the best sushi I've ever tasted. We got the Chef Omakase, and everything was delectable. My favorite was the king clam nigiri. We told the waitress we liked uni as well, and the chef made an uni roll for us! I've only ever had uni on nirigi. The roll was amazing. Definitely worth the price. Ambiance is clean and bright.

WOW. What a contender to Ushiwakamaru. Incredible and efficient service, but we all know we're not really interested in reading about the quality of service, but rather the quality of fish! I am definitely impressed with their extensive selection of extremely fresh fish. Its hard to have so many options and guarantee that any kind would be satisfying. Now the next question beckons to know how to choose from such a selection? Ahh well, the itamae has already highlighted their recommendations on a separate sheet of paper. We still went with the omakase as we always do at Ushi, but we did stress that we wanted uni and albalone in the mix, which they had no problems accommodating to. The final result, the uni was AMAZING BALLS. So was the ?fatty toro and "medium" fatty toro. Everything was so tasty that we even made a second order of the ones we really enjoyed. The only one that surprised me in a bad way was the abalone. Maybe i'm used to having it cook in a chinese broth over some veggies, but the raw abalone tasted like I was chewing on edible plastic that crumbled in my mouth. It was such an odd experience. I have never had abalone in a sushi form so maybe an abalone consigliere can enlighten me on its texture. Another negative is that when you order the omasake and you're not sitting at the bar, they give you the entire tray of all the sushi. Thats right, all in one shot for you to devour. No progression, no nothing. We also had a 90 minute time reserve on our seats. I felt slightly rushed.

Just brilliant sushi. ?Fantastic selection from basic sushi / sashimi all the way to Torro. ?All the food was super fresh, perfectly prepared and delicious. ?Best sushi in Manhattan so far - for my money way better than Sasabune (the paint wasn't peeling off the wall at Yasuda). ?Stand outs were the oysters, eel (so I'm told) and Torro. D¨¦cor was pleasant, waiter wasn't. ?Make sure you ask for the other menu where u can make up your own sushi selection - way cheaper.

Best sushi I've had, hands down, in the US. I've had a friend go and they weren't as big of a fan - but to do it right, you have to call up in advance and make a reservation at the sushi bar and do it omakase style. You'll have your own sushi chef, who will go over likes/dislikes, allergies, etc., and he'll create sushi for you and your party until you say stop. Insanely fresh (flown in daily) - and I love the fact that they season for you. No need to use wasabi/soy sauce yourself.

This was definitely one of my best sushi dinners in years. We had omakase, and each single nigiri piece was just delicious. The price is high, but in my opinion it is worth every single dime. We were unluckily at a table, will shoot for the bar next time.

I don't care how popular of a restaurant they are. When they get cocky with a customer over the phone when trying to make reservations, it's plain rude and annoying. Thus my one star. My annoying convo with the fob waiter: Me: I'd like to make a reservation for two this Friday Waiter: It's all filled M: Saturday? W: Filled M: Sunday? W: Filled M: Can you just tell me a day next week that has available seating? W: Why don't you just call back one week in advance M: Thats why I'm calling ri- W: Hold on, please (puts me on hold for 15 minutes) W: Ok. We have one for Wednesday at 6:00 M: Okay. We'll take that. W: Ok. Give me your last name. M: (my last name is pretty common, so,) Can I just give you my first name beca- W: NO. LAST NAME. M: okay. (gives my last name) W: Ok. Make sure to come 5 to 10 minutes before your reservation. M: okay W: And be sure to call one day in advance to confirm, or else we will cancel your reservation. M: ...okay? (click) Wth. Sushi Yasuda, you aren't no Per Se or Jean George. Even they call YOU to confirm the reservation. Even they "politely" ask that they have your credit card in case of cancellation. I'm fine with adhering to strict rules of fine dining. But not when they come off rude and bothered with all kinds of WE-ARE-TOO-POPULAR-FOR-GOOD-CUSTOMER-SERVICE attitude. Seriously, who are you to act this way with all sorts of rules and acts of superiority complex? Great sushi (but not as great as Sushi Azabu and Sushi of Gari), cocky attitude.

this place is yum. i was pleasantly surprised. haven't really had sushi in nyc before ?but i must say this place is almost as good as the sushi in LA. i kinda like how you can choose your sushi combination from the sushi list so you can ?try the chef's recommendations. ? the fist tasted very fresh. the toro wasn't that fatty, which was kinda disappointing. the uni wasn't as sweet as i'd like. the rice was a tad hard, and not too sweet. which is just the way i like it. think they also have a bigger variety of different fish than the sushi restaurants i've tried in LA. and i like how they categorize them into white fish, clams, etc. ?they also had a lot of selection of clam nigiri. ? next time, going to try every fish on the list.

I came here before Yasuda left to build his empire in Japan. This was the first place where I learned the art of eating sushi. For the past 12 years, I've been eating sushi the wrong way and of course most of that sushi was not served the right way. ?The fish should be sliced so that it's eaten in one bite and the rice underneath should be minimal. When eating, the sushi should be turned on its side and dipped into the soy sauce/wasabi very gently so that you can still taste the fish. In any case, everything I ordered melted in my mouth. After the sushi, I had the green tea ice cream - the REAL green tea ice cream that's darker in color than the Maeda-ens found in grocery stores and has a bitter aftertaste.

Ok - so far I've been a Yelp parasite. I'm addicted to it. I use it, but I never give back. No more. I have been to Yasuda multiple times, and I've always been told that Omikase at the Sushi Bar is the secret (as it tends to be at most Sushi places). So having finally experienced it - I must ask... WTF is the big deal. Let me just start with the fact that I agree with every other review that states the place has terrible service. They are incredibly rude, and rush you (I know there are two seatings - but if you need to rush people, might I suggest spacing them out a little further???). Having said that - tonight the problem was not the service. I had an 8pm reservation at the Sushi Bar for two and I was quite excited, especially since my man Bourdain has waxed poetic about the "rice" and Yasuda-san and bla bla bla (btw, I was informed Chef Yasuda has moved on - not sure if this is the problem)... the problem was the fact that at 7:58pm I was greeted by the stench of foul seafood... something I have NEVER experienced inside a good Sushi restaurant. On the outside while walking past the bags of waiting garbage at 4am, sure... but not on the inside! Then my frustration generally begins with the p!ss-poor choice of Sake (if I recall correctly it's about 5 cold and 4 hot) and three beers - none of them are light!... wake up call, all kirin, asahi, and sapporo make light beers guys! So finally, I Sat at the bar and ordered the Omikase (you know, the reason I never had a great Yasuda experience was supposedly cause I always sat at the table and ordered waiter service).... We started with a decent piece of Toro and quickly went downhill... fast. Most of the pieces of fish were so strong that they could have been from my local Gristede's and not at a high-end Sushi place! To cover that up, the chef doused a majority of it with heavy amounts of lime-juice, mirin, sea-salt or whatever was available. Now I'm no purist by any means, I think Karumazushi is a f-ing rip-off con-artist who basically passes on the freight the fed-ex guy charges him to overnight something from the Tsukiji fish market and slices a piece of fish and just hands it to you. I appreciate the thought and mastery of the right combination of lime-juice, sea salt and Japanese Red Snapper at a place like say, Seki where they seem to BALANCE the fish with other flavors. (Even Masa does this quite well, and we all know Gari is a genius at it). But what praytell is so special about Yasuda?? I have no clue. The New Zealand Salmon was quite delicious, their Unagi and Anago were both excellent, albeit the Anago quite bony. The Chu-Toro and O-Toro delicious as well, but who f-s those up, really? Last but not least - Uni, their "creme-de-la-creme/piece-de-resistance"... now I'm no Uni fan - I never liked Uni, until about 7 months ago when I had my first piece of real proper good Uni (in Tokyo) - been looking for that "first-taste-of-crack-high" since... this was slimey and salty and strong at best - far from the best Uni I've had. Last but not least, Mochi ice cream... the red bean one was passable... but the green tea one - tasted like pure fat/cream!!! Nothing of the light-ness and tea flavor that green tea ice cream is famous for! Seriously high praise and lots high review and consistently on the top results and returns on "Sushi" in Manhattan - when there are at least 10 better places off the top of my head... oh Yelp - you were so perfect... so batting a 1000... now just batting 0.999... :)

Came here early with mom for pre-Theater dinner. We got there on Friday night at 6pm and I was surprised how many people were at the restaurant already. Sushi Yasuda has the freshest sushi hands down. Although the portions are small. The shari's small as well as the fish but definitely delicious!

This place has great quality fish. One of the best places I've been to in NYC. However - the service is majorly lacking. The past 2 times i've been there we were seriously rushed. Now this isn't a fast food sushi place - I don't expect that in a place like Yasuda. So Last night was the last straw. A friend and I went to Yasuda for dinner last night at 6.30. Food came out quickly and the waiter did a good job explaining everything. 7:00 rolls around and I see the waiters and hovering over us looking at our plates! They said we needed to be out by 8:00 so I couldn't understand why they started up already since we had an hour. This went on every 5-10 minutes. At one point there were 4 people looking over my friends shoulder passing by only a few feet away! It was very distracting and rude! Absolutely ridiculous that a top notch spot like Yasuda treats their customers this way. I will not be going back anytime soon that's for sure.

Definitely some of the best sushi I've ever had - I am by no means a sushi connoisseur, but you can just tell from the first bite that the sushi here is some of the freshest, highest quality fish you will get your hands on outside of Japan. ?Every cut of fish I had was perfectly seasoned, as they make sure to put a tiny bit of wasabi and lightly brush the fish with soy sauce before serving it to you. ? Basically, all you are left to do is pick up the sushi (either with two fingers or your chopsticks) and enjoy the meal. ?My friend and I sat at the bar, which is a nice experience because the chefs prepare the sushi as you are eating, making sure to pace your eating by giving you a few pieces at a time. ? The sushi is definitely expensive, so if you aren't willing to spend and have a large appetite, this is probably not the place for you. ?However, if you are looking for some of the freshest sushi in the States, this is the place to be.

My boyfriend and I have been here twice- once on a date and once with his parents. Both times were spectacular. We had the omakase, where the sushi chefs give you the freshest fish of the day. We also ordered the black cod which was out of this world. Incredibly tender and glazed to perfection. Some of the more memorable pieces were the uni, hamachi, and the eel. We got two types of eel, freshwater and saltwater. My boyfriend still mentions the eel once in awhile- THAT good. It's really pricey, but your money isn't going to waste. You really feel like you just walked into a restaurant in Japan. That, and the fact that you're getting top notch sushi. FYI, don't expect any strangely named rolls with loads of sauce- this isn't that kind of place.

The short review: ? The best sushi I have ever had in my life prepared for me by a sushi legend, Chef Yasuda himself. ?Easily 6 stars if Yelp would let me have the honor. The longer review: I went here with Jeff C.'s meetup group. ?This was my first outing with them, and there was no Jeff C. ?:-( ?But there was Chef Yasuda in front of me at the sushi bar all night -- wow! ?We were pretty indecisive about what to order. ?We inquired about an omakase, but they really don't do that. ?But he was willing to choose selections for us in the context of our sushi matsu (12 pieces of sushi and a half roll for $36), and then we would be free to make individual orders after that. Instead of serving everything at once, each piece of sushi is individually prepared and served. ?This is more intimate, and really builds up the experience with a crescendo of anticipation and increasing quality. ?Chef Yasuda is very amiable and jocular; but he is also a skilled salesman. ?While talking to you and having you be distracted, fresh prepared sushi would magically appear on your plate from nowhere -- he is so good! ?Stand outs in the Matsu were the eel (layers of flavor, unlike any eel I have ever had in my life), the shrimp (prepared fresh which makes a very big difference in taste; usually shrimp is a miss for me), and actually everything else -- there was nothing I didn't like, alot! My additional selections were the two recommended types of eel, the orato, and the arctic char with the latter two selections garnering a "good choice" from the master himself! ?Wow, perfection achieved once again. ?They even offer an inexpensive house hot sake which I thought paired well with all of the selections -- in fact, I had two of these! What did I learn from talking with the master for nearly 2 hours? - Iron Chef Japan is just entertainment/television. ?They know the ingredients 2 weeks in advance. - He deferred on naming other chefs that he likes, but did say he likes bangers and mash. ? - He enjoys watching WWE wrestling. ?Doesn't follow sumo wrestling. ?And really doesn't have time to watch movies. - He is on-site everyday for lunches and dinner. ?If he takes time to travel, he goes back to Japan to visit his older, ailing mother. ? - When he was younger he traveled in the western U.S., particularly loving Wyoming, Colorado, and Sedona Arizona. ?He's a country guy at heart. - He uses 2 grains of rice, both from Sacramento in his sushi. - He never drinks on the job, and doesn't find the practice respectful. - He can make 5 sushi rolls in a minute. ?His hands moved so fast, I think he has a magic act on his days off. ? - Sushi should be eaten with the fish facing up, contrary to sushi union propaganda (his term). ?You don't eat a pizza upside-down he says. ?Food for thought. ?(bad pun) And so much more. ?He was so approachable, and even posed for photos. ?All around great experience and great guy. ?Price is surprisingly affordable, only $85 for my selections. ?Highly recommend!!!

Most people who've been to Sushi Yasuda are unaware that the house salad includes a pair of halved grape tomatoes (one yellow, one red) and four string beans. ?They wouldn't have any idea that as you pour the dressing over the lettuce, it's guaranteed to dribble down the side of the small bowl in which it's served. This is because virtually no one goes to Yasuda to order the lunch special. I always order the lunch special. This is because rather than expense-accounting lunch here with TARP bailout money, I'm one of the few actually paying out of my own pocket, and the lunch special is all I can afford. Upon being notified that I won't be ordering "omakase", the waitress manages to maintain her good cheer and hands me a pen and a bright yellow card. ?The card instructs me to check off five pieces (no more than two of any one kind) and two rolls. ?Those in my vicinity at the bar are beginning to wonder what's going on. My salad arrives and people are now openly questioning whether I've even ordered from the same restaurant as them. ?I might start to feel out of place if I hadn't already gone through this many times before. So I'm attempting to enjoy the green salad with its modest garnishes as best as one can while surrounded by others who are savoring some of the world's finest seafood, but the din at the bar inevitably starts to fluster me. "Oh, no thank you Yasuda-san, your o-toro is especially magnificent today, but I don't think I should have an eighth piece. ?How will I have room to try all six kinds of eel!" "Wow. ?This uni from the Canary Islands is even more amazing than the uni from the Seychelles!" Placed on the sushi tray in front of me are two pieces of cobia and one piece each of fluke, orata and striped bass, but at this point I've just about had it with these sea-urchin-swilling motherfuckers. ?Was this splurge really worth it if the closest I'll get to Japanese cuisine in the foreseeable future is a box of instant ramen noodles? Then I take my first mouthful of fish and remember why one trip here will always be more worthwhile than several to any $1 per piece sushi hellhole. After I finish the first half of my order, I receive one Spanish mackerel roll and one with Coho salmon. ?You might think rolls are for amateurs, but they're the highlight of a sushi meal for me. ?The poor man's means of enjoying his favorites six times instead of one. My lunch special has been polished off and I'm asked if I'd like anything else. ?I realize I've neglected to order any eel and you simply can't leave Yasuda without having any eel. I look back at the fish list and note that today there are not only six, but seven varieties. ?I'm racking my brain trying to recall what that fantastic eel was that I had once before. ?Something that began with an S. "I can't decide whether to end with a sawani roll or a shirayaki roll", I whimper to my chef. "No problem", he replies, "I can make you a half roll of each." I love the sushi chefs at Yasuda. ?Even though I may keep my nose buried in a book and surely will spend a pittance compared to the others sitting at the bar, I'm always treated with the same attentiveness as their moneybags clientele. While I enjoy the sawani, the shirayaki is the real star of the day. ?Maybe I'll remember that for my next visit if I write it down once more. Shirayaki.

This place changed my mind about uni. For those that don't know what uni is, it is sea urchin that looks like brains, has the consistency of custard or flan, and smells and tastes like vagina. TIL NOW! At my 18th attempt at trying to understand why others highly recommend this nasty thing, Sushi Yasuda finally prepared the best uni- possibly the only good uni- I ever had. I expected it to taste like a lewd and offensive lesbo, but instead it had its own unique taste incomparable to anything I can think of, topped with a dash of sea salt. For the first time in my life, the uni did not taste like vagina- and I KNOW what vagina tastes like. Trust. Besides the above, I had the chef's special of which the most memorable were the Spanish Mackerel, two types of salmon and tuna (including the fatty variety), and the best eel ever. If you thought something like salmon was your favorite fish, there is no doubt that Sushi Yasuda will have you discovering a new fish to get addicted to. If you are insanely indecisive, the chef's special menu is the way to go. The fish are expertly prepared and lined up neatly like soldiers ready to go on a suicide mission against your stomach. The service is silent but notably attentive and caring. I was wiping my hands harshly on my napkin after I downed that uni, and five seconds later a small dish with a tiny wet towel for my hands appeared on my left side. I am still amazed from that and wonder in fear that if there had been a ninja and the towel was a weapon, I would have been dead by now. They do not play around. The tables are so clean that you can eat off of it. The interiors glow of a soft honey and amber color that relaxes you and makes you forget you are about to drop some serious cash on some sushi. This is a perfect place for sushi purists. Clean, simple, and most importantly- ridiculously fresh fish without the bullshit of sauces and fruit garnishes to ruin a proper appreciation of the animal killed for your hedonistic enjoyment. On a final note, ?Uni haters who try the uni-it's great and all, but just be ready to wash it down with hot tea or their peachy Japanese soda.

OK, where do I start. First of all, if you're going to enjoy this place, you've got to be in a certain mindset. Don't go expecting to be king of the world, because you're not. The rice is. Don't go expecting to fill yourself up. Depending on your budget, and how you order, you very well might leave hungry. But that's ok. Because you're gonna have a great time, and what's wrong with a little ramen after dinner anyway? Basically, go in there the first time with the mindset that you're going to a very serious/fine dining sort of place, because that's what it is. Afterwards you can decide that it's the kind of place you'll want to make your regular sushi place, but won't be able to afford to. Expect to be humbled. OK, so here are some pointers for first timers: 1) Make a reservation to sit at the sushi bar at the very least, and sit in front of the man, Mr. Yasuda if your date/time is flexible. The core of the place is in front of Mr. Yasuda, and at the sushi bar in general. That's what you're coming for. More on Mr. Yasuda later. 2) It's easy to be intimidated, but don't worry about it. Ordering at the beginning was the hardest part, but even if you make a misstep, it's ok. Mr. Yasuda will forgive you. I've read so many different things about how to order and costs and everything, I thought I had it figured out. No, I didn't. But it's really simple. For the first time, take it piecemeal. (3) Get the basic set to start, which is like less than $20 and has 8 nigiri and a half tuna-roll (which my friend said was the best tekka-maki he ever had. I agree.) This is what he'll suggest, just to get the ball rolling. He'll ask you what you don't eat. Tell him. Then he'll give you the nigiri, one by one. It will be awesome. Don't bother with soy sauce, or anything else for that matter. He's already seasoned it for you. Pay attention to the rice. Remember what I said about you not being king of the world? You're not it. But you'll start to feel like it as the meal goes on. 3) After the set is over, start looking at the list the waiters gave you at the beginning, with suggestions for that day marked in red. Start thinking of what looks good to you. Then have the chef choose 4 or 5 more nigiri for you. That's what omakase means: "you decide." It's not a pre-fixe menu. It's whatever the chef thinks is good, and thinks that you'll like. The sushi experience is all about the interaction between you and the sushi chef, and about you trusting him to make you happy. One of two things will happen. Either he'll pick what you were looking at, in which case you'll be amazed at his mind-reading abilities (this happened to us), or he'll pick something totally different. Either way, it's going to be good. Even if you don't think you like sea urchin roe, if he utters the word uni, you say "yes, please." Same goes for eel. 4) At this point it's up to you. You can ask for suggestions, you can ask him for specific things, you can ask him to choose. Whatever. At this point, you can keep going until it feels right to stop. You'll be having a grand-old time with the chef at this point, so he'll know what you like, but if something catches your eye, don't be afraid to ask for it. 5) A cool thing about the list that's in front of you. You'll always know how much each piece is, so you can keep an eye on your budget. The most expensive pieces are the different kinds (!) of toro, obviously, at $7 each. Rolls are a little more expensive, but you're not gonna go and have 5 of those at a time. Uni and other pieces are around $5. 6) About Mr. Yasuda: He's a character. Very nice, but can be a little intimidating at first. Don't worry about it. He's a talker. He'll talk a ton about his whole style, about rice, about where the fish comes from, about what sucks about most japanese restaurants, and why he's doing what he's doing. As my friend said, he's a man on a mission: to make his way of sushi, the standard way of sushi. ?According to him, his way isn't special, just the way its supposed to be. Sometimes it can be hard to understand every word, but just smile and nod, and it'll be fine. Oh, and another thing. He's a smart-ass. Seriously. He spent a good amount of time during the course of the meal busting my balls, but it was all in good fun. I wouldn't recommend this place for a date, for a few reasons. First of all, the focus isn't on the two of you, it's on the food, the chef, and you, and the interaction among them. Secondly, there's the budget thing. Any urge to impress can lead to a skyrocketing bill, and even more if you have appetizers or drinks. Ok, that's all Yelp will let me write. If you love sushi the way it was meant to be, and are prepared to humble yourself, Sushi Yasuda is the way to go.

I first went to Yasuda when visiting New York at the end of 2008, fresh from a trip to Japan it evoked memories of eating breakfast at Tsukiji, long wooden counters, consummate skill and incredible quality. For the next eighteen months I was lost in an Uni wonderland, the love affair that started that night, still consumes me this very day. Last night I made a long awaited return. As a first date venue it can be a little intimidating and I immediately wondered if I had made the right choice, but the warm reception from our counter chef and occasional but not imposing banter, soon allayed those fears. We decided against the Omakase, I have had it before but like the freedom and flow of the meal when ordering piece by piece. For me the jewel of the crown was undoubtedly the Uni, rather than have this straight away we had a few palate warmers, Monkfish liver and Japanese pickles. The liver was served as three slivers, in a Yuzu and Daikon dressing, it was creamy but my date loved it more than I, so we swapped and I devoured the pickles, my number one vice. Next was the Sushi, for which we regularly turned to our chef for advice, and ate in pairs: Yellow tail - Mild and sweet Fatty tuna - Warm and deep in colour Uni - Alaskan and Mayne - The Alaskan was beautiful, brighter in colour than the Mayne and incredibly sweet Oyster and Japanese Mackeral - The Oyster was creamy, soft and incredibly fresh, melting upon the tongue. The Mackeral was clean and sweet defying the oily nature of the Mackeral family Hamachi - Farmed and wild, one variety was known as the bully fish due to its size Sea Scallop - Delicious, lightly dusted with sea salt, my date had the cheek to tell the chef that she found it a little salty and could without the salt, he took it well Toro roll - The finest roll I have had the pleasure of eating, diced fatty tuna, surrounded by a rare high quality seaweed that is only available by auction, simply divine, a must have The size of each piece is perfect, according to the website, Yasuda assesses the size of one's mouth to ensure the size will be just right. The ratio of fish to rice is also delicately measured, the thin sliver of fish complimenting the small bundle of rice. ? What is immediately apparent is the quality of the rice, warm and fluffy, the balance of salt, sugar and vinegar in perfect harmony. I won't rehash what has been clearly articulated many times before but it is due to the types of rice, sea salt and brown vinegar that they use. The brown vinegar is naturally sweeter and softer in flavour than the white counterpart allowing them to use less sugar. I once watched a cooking show where the chef defined the perfect risotto as one where each grain of rice retained its sense of individuality, a little wanky but I loved that line and preceded to make it my own and the defining virtue by which I made risotto. Now I feel that in Yasuda it has a more worthy recipient and in my mind I play out scenes where Yasuda is a general, surveying a battlefield with millions of grains of rice, each with its own clear set of instructions, such is the mastery that they have over their rice. ? Believe the hype, make a reservation and let yourself go. Billing notes: At around $5 per piece it can add up but the sake is reasonably priced, expect to pay around $100 per head. Important notes: -Counter service bookings are for 90 minutes only, be sure to specify that you would like to sit at the counter when making the booking -If possible get a counter booking with Yasuda himself, or the funny and factual old guy right at the end -Counter bookings are only kept for 10 minutes so don't be late -The Shoyu(soy sauce) is a trap, use it without instruction and be shunned for the rest of the night, likewise the wasabi -Likewise the pickled ginger isn't a party snack, eat sparingly and only when you really need to cleanse your palate -When the sushi is placed on the wood board do not get lost in idle conversation and delay eating, the rice will go cold and harden and the chef will sigh and shake his head -Lastly for the feminists out there, do not ask why there are no women working behind the sushi counter, I wisely stayed out of that conversation

Yes, the fellow who takes your reservation over the phone comes off as rude and as if he is doing you a favor. That's one of the quirks of Sushi Yasuda. Don't let it put you off... I don't think it is intentional. This is the best sushi in NYC unless you want to shell out big bucks for Masa or Kuruma zushi. Sit at the bar. Get the omakase. Expect to pay about $125-$150 per person if you're a big eater like me. Enjoy!

Sushi Yasuda will be the first five-star review I write and will probably stay that way for a while. Being a sushi aficionado, I am very particular about my fish and Yasuda is one of those establishment where you cannot even begin to fathom what you are missing until you experience it. Do believe all the hype and the accolades. It is ridiculous how fresh the fish tastes and the service is top-shelf. Need convincing otherwise? Just sit at the bar and order the omakase. It's so good that you will accidentally scream out Yasuda San's name while you're having sex with your girlfriend. And that's okay, because your girlfriend will do the same because she ordered the spanish mackerel and kanpachi sashimi. The spanish mackerel at Yasuda simply melts in your mouth and is nothing short of orgasmic. Yes, go ahead and order a plateful, no one is judging. For those that are budget conscious, there is also a $20.50 sashimi or sushi pre fixe dinner. If you do decide to go with the budget dinner, good luck trying to stop your inner sushi slut from ordering more... I know I can't. I usually rack up a hefty bill at the end of the night, but there is not an ounce of regret in me. Yes, it's THAT good. So what are you waiting for? Reservation for two at 8:30, see you there.

Whooo Hoooo, purists eat your hearts out.... Throw out your spicy tuna roll ladies, because that SHIZNIT is for the BIRDS! ?Yasuda is not just any sushi meal, it's a labor of love, Anya von Bremzen said it's an "initiation into sushidom"---in that case...HELLO SUSHIDOM. ? ? The Sushi God's were thinking highly of me because I was able to call and get us reservations at 8pm at the bar today with Chef Yasuda, someone cancelled =). ? I expected Chef Yasuda to be a serious stoic figure. ?How wrong...I was. ?Take the knowledge of Mr. Miagi, the sense of humor of Don Rickles, the fingers of Horowitz, and the candor of Winston Churchill....roll this all up in the finest and rarest Japanese seaweed.....TADAAAAA...and you get Chef Yasuda. ? You first enter through the sliding glass door and step foot into a modern bamboo oasis. ?Chef Yasuda designed and helped build (with his BARE HANDS) the bamboo sushi bar that is religiously cleaned using special barn (no chemicals) to maintain the dewy yellow tone. ? Like the restaurant, each piece of sushi is constructed in perfect faultless precision. ?Every minute, the sushi will change he says. ?(I asked about Omakase, but the server said that they didn't have it tonight...but recommended the Prix Fixe + additional pieces...which we loved ) Chef Yasuda and his staff are masters in the art of simplicity and detail. ?What impressed el novio even more was that our server noticed he was left-handed, and moved his Asahi so that it did not get in the way of his chopsticks. ?Chef Yasuda noticing this, then positioned each piece of sashimi and sushi in the proper angle for him. ?AwWwWESOME... He then put the pieces of Toro and Tasmanian Trout on our dish. ?The girl next to me asked him how did he become so good at rolling sushi (DUH! Obviously he has super sushi rolling powers). ?He replies, "Invisible spirit"...then bursts out in laughter.... He then told us to eat each piece of ginger separately and not to lay it on the sushi, or else it will taste like "butt." ?"Europeans are old fashioned and they don't shower a lot and lay perfume on, ginger is like perfume but sushi is not good old fashioned, because it will taste like butt." (he said it not me) ? I paid special attention to his hands. ?This man prepared sushi like an eloquent haiku. ?He told us that the secret to great sushi (besides the fresh fish and rice) is in the hands of the chef....ahhhh...we nodded in agreement... ? For desert we had mochi ice cream cake, the green tea and red bean flavors. ?It was a delight. ?So tasty, so sublime. ?The perfect ending to a flawless meal. ? ? After today, I'm embarrassed to say that I once ordered sushi from an Italian restaurant...FAIL for me ************************************************** Fact: There are over 100 different types of Japanese Seaweed Fact: We had the 2nd rarest type at Yasuda. Fact: Chef Yasuda calls Masa, "The Pawnshop" Fact: To get the best sushi experience with Chef Yasuda, ask to sit at the end right corner of the bar Fact: Chef Yasuda likes to watch pro wrestling on Youtube

It was not by chance that a homage visitation was paid to the highly acclaimed, Sushi Yasuda. ?A referral from my dear friend Akiko advised that I dine at this fine establishment (as what she deems is the best sushi in NY) to truly appreciate the arm of Sushi consumption. So... ?I opted to call the restaurant and made a reservation... ?After a 5 minute exchange with the reservationist (and about 15 repeats as the guy had a supremely heavy Japanese accent), the date was set! Details: ?Date - 6/7, Time - 6:30pm, Party - 2 People, Seating - At the Sushi Bar, Served by Master Yoshi. Upon arriving @ Sushi Yasuda, one thing jumped out at me. ?The Ambiance!!! ?The opulence of the restaurant's decor was on full display. ?Diners will find that the theme of the restaurant is that of a soothing and relax atmosphere that allows for the consumption and savoring of the sushi offerings. ?The light pine stained wall panels, and heavy emphasis on the wooden furniture allows for the restaurants' patrons to be completely at ease. That is... ?Until they realize that their table is on a 2 hour timer, and that getting a reservation was as difficult as getting into Nobu (Tribeca)!!! With that aside, the food... OMG! ?The Food! Entree? Sushi Matsu = 12 pieces of Nigiri & a Half Roll. ?Below are my choices... - 2 Pieces of Tuna - 1 Piece of Salmon - 2 Pieces of Sea Scallop - 1 Piece of Salmon Roe - 2 Pieces of Yellow Tail - 1 Piece of Spanish Mackerel - 1 Piece of Stripped Bass - 2 Pieces of Squid Sushi - Half Roll = Spanish Mackerel Alright, for the sake of sounding supremely pretentious and out of line, the food was comparable by few and far between. ?Each individual piece of Nigiri contained their own lingering freshness, which was confirmed by the fatty and buttery texture. ?The pieces that jumped out at me the most were the Sea Scallop and the Stripped Bass. ?Unlike other sushi establishments, the Sea Scallop contained a buttery texture and had within it a fatty core, which aided in the distribution of the fat and protein ratio for this single Nigiri piece. ?Although the size of the individual Nigiri pieces were small, each had the boasting flavor that makes up for the quantity. Upon consuming my order, I opted to start a conversation with Master Yoshi as I inquired of the Toro he had at the helm. ?He was glad to see that my sushi knowledge was greater than that of most patrons (as I had inquired if he had both Chu Toro & O-Toro). ?Upon brief chatter, I was presented with a single piece of O-Toro Nigiri. ?Let me first say, if I thought the Maguro was Good, then the O-Toro was Perfection! ?The overwhelming fatty texture that's commonly found in Tuna Belly was well present. ?Not only was this piece worth savoring, it should be ordered in large quantities. It must've been my facial expression that gave the delighted approval but Master Yoshi once again engaged in a conversation and asked if there was anything else I wished to try. ?Of course, Akiko had warned that their Live Scallop Nigiri was one that needed to be had. ?Thus, Live Scallop it was. ?I must admit, the Live Scallop was about 10 times between than the O-Toro! ?The consistency of the Live Scallop had the texture of Liver, and contained a taste that's of the best fat distribution of any sushi piece ever consumed. ? I must Thank Akiko for her suggestions! ?I was surely happy after my initial consumption of the Sushi Matsu but the O-Toro & Live Scallop threw it over the top! Of course, the highlight of the entire evening was the conversation with Master Yoshi. ?I had intended to be served by him prior to my arrival at the restaurant. ?I was able to decipher and learn the following from him during my dining experience. 1) Nori (or Seaweed) used in the Maki application is that of a rare kind that's grow in Japan only during seasonal months. ?The crunchy seaweed found in most other restaurants is that of imitation grade. 2) The Wasabi used in each application is derived from that of a smaller horse radish root, thus allowing for a more concentrated and potent taste. 3) The O-Toro served, must be consumed within 2-3 minutes after the application is complete. ?The room temperature quick distorts the quality of the fish. So... ?Lessons learned through my dining experience @ Sushi Yasuda? - Always heed the suggestions of the Sushi Master about their offerings. ?Don't go Soy Sauce crazy like that maniac next to me. - Sit at the Sushi Bar! ?You're better off getting to know your Sushi Chef so they can make suggestions as to what's preferred on their menu for that particular day. [8 minute, 42 second pause)... While writing this review. ?My sushi senses just 10 folded and hit me like a ton of bricks. ?I just made another reservation to Sushi Yasuda for 2 weeks after the first visit... ?Of course, @ the Sushi Bar w/ Master Yoshi himself. ?=)

Can I PLEASE take this sushi place back home to Cali with me!?! I had to give this place a try after seeing it on "No Reservation" and the sushi here was superior! Every single piece melted in my mouth!! My experience here is indescribable...the chefs are so on point w/ their work...just the right amount of everything! There is no chopsticks, soy sauce or wasabi (unless the chef thinks what he is serving u needs/requires those things) but they put just the right amount on for u already. I could not stop eating...everything was just so amazing! I will most def be coming for another round before heading back to Cali....

Chef Yasuda, you have ruined me for life. All the memories of "great" sushi I've ever had in my brain were shattered starting with the first bite of tuna you fed me. If this is how sushi is supposed to taste like, I never want it from any other place .. EVAR! I sat at the bar for Omakase, and everything the chef made, I ate. The fish tasted so good, that during several pieces, I wish I didn't have to swallow The fate of my stomach was left in his hands and like a baby waiting to be fed, mesmerized I sat silently as he brought out piece after piece of heaven. Bad memories from when I chewed on a nasty piece of squid for 5 minutes before spitting it out, had me hesitant to try it at Yasuda. Think uni tastes like vagina? Think mackerel is too oily? Don't write them off completely until you've tasted it at Yasuda. The meal still haunts my dreams from the freshness of the fish, to the precise sprinkling of rock salt or the drops of lemon that accentuated the flavors of the sea. The chef fed us 16+ pieces of tuna, yellowtail, mackerel, salmon, trout, oyster, uni, fluke, oh my! Although my stomach was starting to swell, I could have eaten more! The restaurant was immaculate, the service, swift yet silent allowing you to fully enjoy your meal uninterrupted. Yes, you will destroy your paycheck with this meal if you sit there silently with your mouth open at the bar for 90 minutes but if you manage to allow yourself some self control, you can trim your costs by limiting yourself to a certain number of pieces. Yes, it's difficult when you have one of the best sushi chefs in NYC feeding you piece after piece of precious sushi. Ignore the soy sauce on the table. Chef Yasuda pre-seasons every piece leaving you to do nothing more than eat. 5 big stars for Chef Yasuda and his skillful hands. He's a pleasure to watch and to chat with as well. He'll keep you entertained and educated about the fish you are eating . All other sushi chefs are just "actors" as he would say.

Hmm...maybe my expectations were too high, considering it's so highly rated on Zagat. While we had a great time here, I wasn't particularly blown away. FOOD: *I have this unsubstantiated suspicion that in order to fully appreciate Sushi Yasuda (meaning, to experience a five-star meal), you have to sit within the close reach of chef Yasuda and have him make your nigiris in a omakase style. Well, not everyone gets that opportunity (it's hard enough to get a table reserved here)...and frankly, I believe that every patron, wherever he's seated, should be afforded the same level of quality...right? *Anyway, the food. For appetizers, we had the "hone" or fried eel backbone that was wonderfully flavored with lemon and sea salt and surprisingly light and crispy. The cod fish "oroshi-ni" with a pile of grated daikon was even better. I need to learn how to prepare that dashi... *We ordered a variety of nigiri's...about 15 kinds. Yes, the fish was exceptionally fresh, and as commonly noted, melty. We were especially impressed with pompano, "special" unagi, albacore and white salmon. And the pieces already came with a fair amount of wasabi, which is a big plus in my opinion. However, the shari in some pieces were falling apart, and the neta was unevenly and thinly cut, even smaller than what you'd find in Japan nowadays. *The chirashi was interesting; I was instructed to "mix" the entire bowl with a spoon so it'd end up looking like a bara-zushi. The chef apparently believes that this is the best way to eat it...but well, I didn't quite see it. *I loved the shari. Flavor wise, firmness wise, temperature wise...it's made to perfection. *Lastly, the egg tasted like vanilla custard. Seriously. SERVICE: Flawless, though a bit uptight. They change your tea mug every so often, whether it's been touched or not. Good to know that you'll always have a cup of hot green tea. AMBIANCE: Clean, bright, spacious, modern... A "New York" sushi environment. PRICES: Standard. SUM: I miss Tsukiji.

It a sweet weekday lunch-hour (uncrowded) when V and I met G-Money for sushi lunch at Yasuda. The name precedes the actual experience. I used to work around 44th and 5th so I was surprised because I had walked into the venue several months back because of the sushi bar ambiance - expensive, clean, simple with a Japanese wood panel theme. A great experience and recommended for any sushi-lover. For the Omakase from great sushi chefs, you have an option 8-10-12. I was opting for 12--if I am getting the best sushi in NY, I want the most of it. G was the guest of honor and she chose 10, 7 different sushi pieces and 3 rolls which was a great amount. They were all delicious. Next time, I want to choose my own, keeping a few that I tasted... The sushi keepers: Toro King Salmon Uni Our table got to talking about flavors, this king salmon is tastier than that salmon, the spanish mackerel is tougher than the (reg) mackerel. The cooked shrimp (also topped with rock salt) was nothing compared to the sweet honey taste of the cooked eel/unagi. G and I attempted to give Uni another try (10+ past attempts for both of us). The uni was topped with a pinch of rock salt, it also tasted slightly torched to give it a brulee flavor. We could just never fully grasp its popularity and flavor...until now... I really don't know what did me in, I usually understand why something taste good or bad. ?I felt like I was playing a game of 20 questions. And then it hit me...as sea urchin roe, uni has a funny taste--almost something familiar...a flavor that most adults will eventually encounter...a body part with many other names...what is better known, for lack of better names, as 'vag' or for some 'lesbo'. I like sushi at all times and all forms..but uni is a taste too close to home...the fishiness...claminess...the sliminess...the textures...all seem similar to the female sexual organ pre-wet on top of a piece of sushi rice. Now you have something to think about the next time you have a piece of uni sushi. And like great sex, Yasuda had great uni. A perfect place for sushi purists, Yasuda's name is out and well-known. Uni will be your and my dirty little secret.

No gimmicks here, this place means business. The restaurant is in one of the city's dreariest restaurant neighborhoods. ?I have wanted to come here for years but never felt like making a reservation for dinner around grand central. ?My brother and I were in the area, walked in and were seated promptly. ?The decor is minimalist with the tables, floor, walls, and the ceiling composed of solid bamboo planks. ?It kind of looks like the interior of giant bamboo bento box. We elected to go with the pre-fixe, a bottle of sake, and two Sapporos. ?The sushi was of the highest quality and prepared by-the-book. ?The waiter told us that the fish is flown in daily from places like Alaska, Nova Scotia, and Japan and I believed him. ?We were also able to pick two rolls each and we went with the freshwater-eel, cherrystone-clam, squid, and butterfish which was delicious. ?This is not the type of place where you dunk your sushi in soy sauce or add a lot of wasabi because you'll want to appreciate the freshness and texture of the fish. ? I want to give it 5 stars but I can't because we were not completely full when we finished. ?I went out drinking that night and found myself at a diner afterwards getting disco fries because I was hungry. ?I shouldn't blame Yasuda for my alcoholism but I'm not going to blame myself either. ?The Sushi is still exquisite and one of the best in the city.

It's been a long time coming. Ending my unwitting hiatus from sushi that is. And this review is dedicated to Chun for *finally* scheduling this long overdue dinner. All debts repaid, my friend. And Sushi Yasuda was the best place hands down to emerge from sushi hibernation. The silent gorging and eye rolls of pleasure were confirmation that this is one of the best sushi restaurants I've ever been to. I was advised to go with the Sushi Matsu and order single pieces afterwards. At first I thought 12 pieces of sushi and half a roll would be enough, but after going through Toro, Hamachi, Unagi, Uni (ecstatic eye roll here), Salmon, Scallop and more Unagi - of course I needed to try the Buri and some more Maine Uni. Then I was sated, happy and ready to do a little dance as a result of the happiness. But I refrained because I am sure I wouldn't be invited back here. Our Sushi Chef Yoshi was smiling, assertive and informative. There's nothing more to say other than that it was his personal touch that made the meal even more spectacular. I still am dreaming of Uni and Unagi. As good as it gets people.

I regret not booking 3 weeks ahead for the counter seats with Chef Yasuda when I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday back in November 2010 because Chef Yasuda has already left the restaurant and I won't be able to try his specially prepared sushi unless I travel all the way to California. ?Just our luck! ?Anyway, both my boyfriend and I still had a great time dining at a regular table and being served by multiple chefs. ?All of the other chefs seemed just as skilled as Chef Yasuda. ?We ate some of the most fresh and tasty sushi and sashimi ever! ?

If you've never had good sashimi in Asia, or you don't know where to find it in NYC, you can come here and pay a huge amount of money for something that is very nice, but way way overpriced and pretentious. The fish here is very good, but the portions are nutty small, and you are expected to accept this as normal. The service is confusing, the place is noisy. Again, you are expected to accept all of this. You will pay $5 for a single scoop of ice cream. Just smile. The rice can come out crumbly and dry. This is normal. Some of the chefs are not that skilled and don't have much to do. Smile, smile. But you'll see there are very few Asians dining here. Real fish lovers know it's a gyp.

I am somewhat of a sushi snob and a pizza snob...I've been to the best in the world and I know what I'm talking about when it comes to sushi and pizza among other things... with that said, This place is a JOKE!! ? I am somewhat convinced that New Yorkers don't know their sushi. ?This place is booked in advance up to two weeks and they're very snobby and rude when it comes to taking reservations. ?They tell YOU to call to confirm if not they won't keep your reservation. ?They tell you to arrive on time, because they'll only hold the table for you for 10 minutes. ?They give you an hour and a half to eat and after that you have to get out. Now if their food was exceptional, I would not mind all of the above! ?At first when you walk in, you are seated after the maitre d checked off your name from their reserve list. ?The place is nice looking and has good vibe to it. ?It's well presented with 6 professional looking all Japanese sushi chefs lined up behind the bar awaiting their orders. ?So the first impression was good. ?We sat down and were pleased and expected good food. ? We ordered 4 orders of Otoro (1 order = 1 slice), 4 orders of Hamachi (again all sushi order contain 1 piece rather than the traditional 2 pieces), 4 orders of anago, 4 orders of today's special oyster which came shucked not in shell, a salmon skin roll, tuna roll, and an anago roll. ? We started off our lunch with orders of miso soup for my kids and an asari sakamushi (steamed clams in broth) for my husband and I. ?I asked if they have Uni and of course they didn't. ?Another sign that the diners here don't know what their eating. ?A good Japanese sushi restaurant always carry uni (sea urchin), because they sell them! ? The asari sakamushi had so much sand and shells in it I had to keep spitting out the shells. ?Broth was ok and the clams were overcooked. ?Miso soup was fine, because it wasn't salty like the American/Japanese version. ? When it comes to the Otoro, it was a pure JOKE! ?I've had countless good toros in my life, especially Otoro when I can get them. ?They charge $8 for a slice of Otoro which's about a size of my Thumbnail and it's not even that fatty!! I don't mind if they charge double that for a slice but make it good quality with bigger size!! The rolls, needless to say were small, but fair. ?The salmon skin roll was delicious, but the ratio of the skin vs the rice were all wrong. ? The only good thing about this place is their wasabi which's real not paste, and their atmosphere was good. ? Overall this place is like a good looking model with no brains and substance. ?They even try the incognito approach with their store front with only a fish on their signage...sadly this approach fails big time unless they can deliver amazing sushi and sashimi like their counterpart Masa Takayama of Masa (formerly of Ginza Sushi Ko which was certainly incognito with not even a signage or a store front! ?It was inside of one of the shopping buildings on Rodeo Dr. Beverly Hills and just had a blue door like some office...only those in the know walked through them knowing that they were going to be served amazing sushi! ?Patrons like myself paid $500/person without blinking an eye because it was WORTH IT!) ? Sushi Yasuda, you may be making money right now off of these foolish New Yorkers who don't know their sushi, but you have a long way to go if you want to survive in the eyes of the sushi connoisseurs. ? I should have known, when 99% of the diners in the restaurant were caucasians who ordered "diet Coke" with their sushi meals...tsk tsk tsk.

What with all the ultra-positive reviews, I was expecting a life-changing experience. ?It didn't change my life, but the fish was extremely fresh and tasty. ?The prix-fixe is a very good deal, so go for that. ?I have to say, though, that even though the portions are satisfying, they could be a bit bigger. I chose tamago, orange (?) clam and Spanish mackerel. ?The tamago was excellent. ?I could have eaten 20 pieces of it alone! ?The other tastes kind of blended into each other, and I wasn't very impressed, but it was really good, just because it was so fresh! ?For dessert, we got our ice cream mochi. ?The sad part was that we just got one...... The place is very nice, very minimal decor, modern, etc. ?But I was a little disappointed that they didn't have the fun toilets. ?The bathrooms were clean, but could have used better decor. ?The service was pretty great and snappy.

Proprietors/Chef: Shige Akimoto, Scott Rosenberg and Naomichi Yasuda .Thursday Night Dinner. Taste ****** Mind dizzying sushi & sashimi. ?The best in class that sushi has to offer in NYC. ?Just thinking about the savory bite crunch of the uni makes me quiver to no end. ?I simply had to order another one. ?It was only proper and compliments to Chef Yasuda. ?He caters to your every desired taste buds and warmly educates you... enabling a rich and humbling experience for us. ?As soon as I hinted at my love for hamachi, I got yellow-tailed left & right. ?No complaints! ? ? ? ? Ambiance ****** Simply classic....clearly brings out the character of the chef and his point of view. Service ******** PHENOMENAL. HUMOROUS and Charming. He had to check in on me a few times, because I trailed off in conversations. ?I was enjoying the food way too much in silence... I didn't mean to be rude! Dislikes - FLAWLESS. Likes - If you can't decide on your picks, trust the chef with his picks. ?Anticipate with surprise and enjoy. ?You won' be disappointed! Tips - Book your reservation in advance, at the bar with none other than Chef Yasuda himself. ?And whatever you do, don't put wasabi in your "shoyu" soy sauce .. and if you order sushi, you are not allowed to dip it in the soy sauce. ?He brushes the sauce and wasabi already for you on the fish itself... You'll insult him otherwise. ?Severe mistake learned... I saw him cringe .. which made me cringe in shame. Overall - Charming, flawless experience with fantastic food that will melt your heart. ?It's such a pleasure watching him with such precision. ?I'm already waiting in line for the next reservation I'm able to make with the one & only. ?The bottom line price tag? Yeah, it's a bit pricey, but they also offer prixe fix meal which is a hell of a bargain!

best sushi. best omakase experience. our chef was incredibly talented: precise, efficient. it was a joy to watch him work. every single piece of fish was seasoned to absolute perfection. the balance he struck with the precise application of salt, lemon, soy sauce, etc was magical and ethereal. and we learned so much about the products they source and use. the chef really listened to our feedback and questions and tailored the progression of the meal accordingly. for instance, i mentioned that my companion enjoyed uni only once in his life (he's tried it several times, but only once actually liked it). i find this unforgivable. to have been on this earth for as long as he has and not have been moved to submission by more than one uni. thusly, the chef prepared a flight of uni that changed both my and my companions lives. fresh, delicious, great variety of fish. the rice is seasoned and prepared to perfection. they have different grades of nori, some of the best in the world. ?best in ny. you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't opt for the omakase.

"Thank you so much!" After calling countless times, I had an long awaited table at Sushi Yasuda, New York's best sushi restaurant. Hip hopping through the doors on Christmas Eve, I was delighted to finally arrive at the Mecca for New York Sushi. The exterior design with a sleek steal door shows off its cool sophisticated look. But the interior with warm wooden panel, just welcomes guest and the immediate smell of vinegary rice just affirm that we had arrive at New York's finest. Sushi purest welcome, sushi modern eaters, steps aside. Don't expect caterpillar rolls, but instead sushi served with great knife skills and ingredients. Fresh fish over a bed of vinegary rice. Simple, yet hard to master. I ordered the Omakaze "chef choice." Starting with the fresh sashimi, the vibrant pieces just heightened my palate. When the army of nigiri sushi arrived, I had reached sushi heaven. Let the raw fish play center stage, step aside SOY SAUCE! Served on lacquer trays, a few notables including creamy sea urchin and buttery yellowtail. The main actor stealing the show was the medium toro (tuna belly) that simply melted in your mouth. The distinct sea sweet taste just lingered on the palate and hit all the right notes. Eat diner is limited to two hours for seating so watch the clock. Service is very attentive and while I spent $80 for my meal, there is a great sushi and roll option priced around $25. The hardest part is getting a table.

"All other sushi in America, fake fake fake." - Master Yasuda Of course the food was glorious; there are like a gazillion raving reviews on yelp already. And since I can't top Jeff "Walking Zagat's" earlier review on the food play by play, just read his to know what to order. With that said, don't even bother ordering from the menu--just be putty in Master Yasuda's hands. ?And no worries, it's not that expensive*. I agree w/ the earlier point about the unnecessary sea salt but who am I to argue w/ The Yasuda. Remember that scene in Ratatouille when the rat (forget his name) experienced the power of the cheese + fruit combo for the first time, triggering a tastebud and neuron jubilee? Yeah, pretty much the same experience @ Yasuda. It's as if I've NEVER had eel or giant clam or toro in my life. I think the Aladdin song "A Whole New World" started coursing through my yearling tastebuds. ?And if you're looking for the Monster Sushi rolls w/ mayo cheese whiz, bacon, or other type of gastro gimmicky nonsense, wrong place my friend. ? Amazing food is amazing food, but Yasuda's quips, anecdotes, and Alton Brown detailing of sushi made the night experiential and one that now makes the list of top 10 meals. *Ok, so it's not Teriyaki Boy cheap but how much plane ticket to Tokyo? ?Money saved, dear prudent consumer. ?We spent around 85 bux (no alcohol) and left dreaming of elastic pants. Just FYI - Rice EXPANDS so pace yourself when stuffing your face.

The sushi here is beyond words wonderful. It is so fresh, I swear all of the fish must have been swimming scant hours before the meal. I had a variety of sushi, including a tuna roll, egg sushi, tuna sushi, squid, and (drumroll) cherrystone clam. I was very excited to try a new sushi, and the clam was very good. I love the texture of clam and the taste is not offensive like oysters. (No offense to oyster lovers out there.) What I was disappointed about this time, though, was the service. It seemed like they wanted to hurry us out of there! Granted, at the time of making the reservation, they mentioned something vague about having something going on where we would need to finish by 1:30, but clearing up quickly and telling us they had run out (or didn't have in the first place?) any of the listed desserts was ridiculous! Anyway, the sushi was fabulous, so we left content. ? I'd been here a few times before and truly enjoyed every aspect of the experience, so I'm dismissing this one service disappointment as a one-off because they were wonderful the previous times I was here.

Perfection arrives on a prada-esque plate here at Sushi Yasuda. Their decor is emulated by their food; clean, perfect, simple, elegant. I don't know where else to recommend someone to go more than here as long as you don't mind that there are no crunchy California rolls and no loud banging techno music. And trust me, I love that scene too, I love my Blowfish Sushi and my Blue Ribbon, but this is sushi in it's perfect state: raw. My girlfriend had a plethora of eel to choose from, couldn't make a decision, and so tried five different types. The smile on her face as she gulped down her baby tako was of sheer pleasure. It was light, buttery, and had a wonderful texture. We hadn't had better tako elsewhere (although Sushi Roku's baby tako special sashimi was excellent in Vegas as well and comes in at a close second). The seabass soup was incredibly fragrant, the fish flaky and wasn't dry in the interior at all. The sake we had (and much of it we drank that night I must confess) was amazing. We don't usually drink cold clear sake, just nigori which is an unfiltered sweet sake that is white, and our server picked the perfect one to accompany our meal. Four bottles later we were ready to put our Manhattan coats on and bear the cold as we walked through Midtown in awe and in love of the city I fantasize about as home. Although not cheap, Sushi Yasuda is worth every dollar. I would have paid three times the bill and still had been satisfied. My miso did really taste better there. And to me that's the question that I always ask myself, "Where is the miso better, and is it just a figment of my imagination that it is?" No, it was better here, along with everything else. Everytime I go to my beloved NYC I always hit up Yasuda. You'll see us, bundled in the corner, with hands wrapped around our tea and sake, eyes wide, just waiting for the freshness to drop on the table.

Absolutely amazing. I apologize in advance because I know I'm going to wax hugely dorky in this review. I am just absolutely in love with this place and had an amazing experience here. We showed up a little earlier than our reservations time because I took it upon myself to sprint to the restaurant in 4-inch shoes to make sure we weren't late and missed our reservation. By the time we sat down, I was, to put it lightly, glistening from my exertions. Our sushi chef noticed and immediately barked in someone in Japanese to crank up the AC for me. And that's how I met Chef Yasuda. We had somehow lucked out completely and were seated right in front of Chef Yasuda himself at the sushi bar. He chose our first five pieces for us, culminating in the amazing sea urchin. I thought I didn't like sea urchin but this was nothing like anything I've had before. We then chose our next pieces, with his guidance and recommendations -- everything was different and interesting and absolutely delicious. By the end of the night, I was in such awe of Chef Yasuda that I was quoting him to my boyfriend as if he was some wise sensai (which he, btw, totally is). I loved how you would order a piece, he'd make it and put it in front of you to eat immediately. The uni is amazing; the peace passage oyster was also amazing to a lesser degree. The squid was okay in my book (due to a natural dislike for squid more than anything) but the effort put into preparing it was worth the order. The eel was definitely different from any other place's eel; Chef Yasuda made it a point to inform us that it was once live eel purchased at Canal Street and then carried, in buckets, onto the subway and brought to the restaurant where it was prepared and cooked and grilled two times. All the sushi was amazing and I felt sad when the meal was over (ie I was too full to eat any more). I think what really made the meal was sitting right in front of Chef Yasuda. Every piece of sushi he prepared had a story behind it and he knew where every piece of fish in the restaurant came from. Eel from Ecuador by way of Canal Street, sea urchin from California, trout from Australia, mackerel from Florida (actuallly, not sure about that one, I just remember something from Florida). You can tell he has real love and passion for his restaurant and his work. He was also extremely nice and attentive; when he noticed I was left-handed, he made sure to turn each piece so that it was easy for me to access. Don't expect any inside-out rolls or spicy tuna ("fake sushi," as Chef Yasuda would say). The sushi pieces are small ("big pieces are from lazy sushi chefs who don't want to cut") and perfectly bite-size. The decor is simple, beautiful and bright. The food is quality-oriented, not gimmicky. So, my tips? Definitely try to sit in Chef Yasuda's section at the sushi bar. Eat whatever the man gives you, you will love it. Even if you don't get Chef Yasuda, though, don't sweat it -- the food is delicious regardless. Now I feel sad remembering it and not being there any more.

I've been back to Yasuda a few times since my last review. ?It's one of the only restaurants in its price range that I'm willing to revisit, especially in a city I don't live in. ?Last month, I came back with my mom and we had the omakase for the first time. ?The sushi was superfluously delicious, as ever. That said, I wouldn't necessarily recommend the omakase over ordering a la carte at Yasuda, at least if you're not at the sushi bar. ?My mom and I made our reservation last minute, and we could only get a table. ?Whereas ordering piece by piece at the sushi bar gives the Yasuda experience a leisurely sense of ceremony, omakase at a table brings plates lined with fish in a pretty blunt presentation, starting with one large course that contains around half the calories of the meal. ?The table service is wonderful - our server was a polite young Japanese man with accented but lovely English, and he explained everything we were getting - but it takes away some of the thrill of an omakase meal. ?After each wave, you have the option of ordering more, but good luck prolonging the meal. ?We were in an out in 45 minutes, which was a bit jarring considering the $240+ pre-tip bill. ?That's the other thing about the omakase - you can build a stellar meal from the a la carte menu at a much lower price. ?All the top recommendations are circled right on the menu, and since Yasuda doesn't deal in super obscure fish, you can guess pretty well what you'll like. All that said (and also the rice being less amazing somehow than usual), the food was spectacular. ?We started with an amuse bouche of sushi rice and whitefish deep fried into a little ball. ?Kind of weak and bland, actually, but the only part of the meal that warranted that description. ?After that we got our plank. ?On it were toro, kanpachi, kinmedai, King salmon, aji, tako, amaebi, and uni. ?We cleaned that off fast, and it was followed by ootoro, given some respect and served alone. ?When we asked for more, we got anago and sawani, an eel duet, then a negitoro hand roll. ?Next came a small plate with four types of nigiri - shima-aji, hirame, saba, and King salmon, a different type this time, from New Zealand. ?We ended the meal with more uni, at our request, this time in a hand roll, and finally, a small board with ikura and atsuyaki tamago. ?All of the fish was amazing. ?The cold, loose uni melted like cream, the regal fatty ootoro like butter. ?The salmon kings were spectacular, oily and flavorful, a class apart from the common sake. ?The kanpachi and kinmedai yielded firm textures and clean flavors, and the mackerel nigiri were fishy in a lovely way. ?Seared eel brought mouth-filling flavor, earthy and warming, light in texture. ?And of course, never leave Yasuda without hand rolls and egg. ?The nori here is in its own class, crispy and neat, satisfying to pass your teeth through, with that pure seaweed taste. ?I'd had the negitoro, but the uni was new - well worthwhile, though I wouldn't choose it over the nigiri. ?The sweet and salty tamago ended our dinner better than most desserts, and with it, we were out. So I guess I can't say I didn't love the omakase, because obviously, I did. ?I just know I've been to Yasuda a few times now, and that the omakase meal is the only one I've had anything to complain about. ?Maybe the real takeaway from this review is that you should always, always sit at the bar. ?The sushi at Yasuda is never less than top notch, but it's best presented straight from the chef, piece by perfect piece.

The only thing better than a leaf of buttery, unctuous o-toro sashimi is a leaf of buttery, unctuous o-toro sashimi followed by o-toro cheek sushi and o-toro scallion rolls. Oh, that sweet moment where the fat melts on your tongue... And then [pause for palate-cleansing pickle] ...King salmon... ...White King salmon... ...Rainbow trout... ...Tiger fish... ...Mackerel... ...Fluke... Expert cutting that maximizes flavour and texture. Fresh-grated wasabi. Warm, fat grains of seasoned rice. :) Food coma. :) Food nirvana. *I agree with everyone else. Sit at the bar--we were at a table and I was so jealous because I could hear the chef expounding upon something or other to his hungry audience. It sounded really interesting.

This is sushi heaven. ?I savor every bite of sushi at Yasuda. ?It's such a treat to eat here, esp if you're sitting at the sushi bar and ordering omakase... I guarantee that you won't be disappointed and will be looking forward to the next meal here. ? There's nothing in particular I would recommend since EVERYTHING is delicious (toro, arctic char, salmon, scallop, giant clam, sea eel, freshwater eel, ikura, etc...). ?The sashimi is served with sea salt on the side (which is the best salt I've ever had... had no idea there were differences in salt taste?!?); many of the sushi pieces (perfect bite size morsels with just the perfect combo of fish and rice) are brushed lightly with shoyu with a squeeze of lemon. ?Stuff just melts in your mouth! ?Though I love getting the omakase, it's hard to stop yourself and just keep going & going & going... it's hard to put a stop to something this good no matter how full you are! ? The service is impeccable and the simple interior decor is clean, modern, and almost stark. ?But the focus here is on the food so I won't even bother with anything else. ?In my book, Sushi Yasuda is probably one of the top 3 sushi places in the country. ?It definitely comes at a price but it's definitely worth the splurge.

The approach here is pretty straight forward: 1. Request a seat at the bar (preferably with Yasuda-san, but I doubt you can go wrong with any of the itamae) 2. Omakase (it's tempting to try kitchen specials, but go for them some other time) 3. Hold on for a wild nigiri ride! (you'll do just fine without maki or sashimi, trust me) If you do happen to sit in front of Yasuda-san, he comes across as a very jovial and passionate guy. ?He's more than happy to talk about not only what you're eating, but where it came from and why he's chosen it for your meal, all while executing knife strokes that are an attraction in and of itself. ?And he does this without being overbearing or making you feel like you're in some kind of sushi lecture hall. The bottom line is that it's excellent Tokyo-style sushi. ?It's easy to take this particular style of sushi for granted, especially given the strong influence of Nobuyuki Matsuhisa (Nobu) in the US sushi scene. ?However, Yasuda-san proves that genius can be found in simplicity.

BEWARE!! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!! Understand one thing about me first: I have lived in Japan, go there every year, my wife grew up in Japan and my son is being raised bilingual. I have dedicated my life and my work to Japanese culture. So when I say that this restaurant has gotten too big for it's britches, I hope you'll take my words seriously, and understand why I am so passionately motivated to write this review. We were looking for a solid sushi experience for our 11th anniversary dinner and made a reservation here before leaving from Los Angeles. (I'm from NY but we live in LA now). The morning of our anniversary I was visiting my father upstate and I got the call from the the manager of Yasuda to confirm our reservation. When he said it was for two, I corrected him saying it was for three. He said, "No, it's for two." "I said, no, I made it for three, we have our son with us. It was not supposed to be for two." He insisted it was for two, and that I had made a mistake. This went on for a while, until I put my wife on with him, thinking that she can explain this to him better in Japanese. That was a mistake. He became very rude to her, and she thought he treated her badly because she is a woman. She handed the phone to me again, practically in tears. Now the manager changed his tune. He said, the reason we've lost our reservation is due to the fact that we didn't call 24 hours in advance to confirm. And that they have a rule requiring this. What??? So, he concluded, there's nothing he can do. But what about our anniversary dinner? Now we're left with no where to go - how can I find another place the day of, when we had made this plan a week in advance? He could care less. The manager hung up. I am very pleased, however, to mention that all turned out for the best that evening, because we ended up at a wonderful place called Sushi Azabu, in Tribeca. You won't find better service or quality of food unless you go to Japan, and even then, this place stacks up against the best. ?Sushi Azabu gets my highest recommendation, and we will visit this place again next time we're in NY. Sushi Yasuda - sayonara!

I sincerely hope Master Yasuda forgives my wifey. She has shamed me and my family name. If this were feudal Japan, I'd probably have to commit seppuku with my sharpest chef's knife... Those of you who did your homework on Master Yasuda know that he is somewhat of a sushi guru. ?The man knows everything to know about fish ?and how to maximize one's enjoyment of it. ?I invite you to peruse the restaurant's website where the gory details of Master Yasuda's single-minded pursuit of perfection is spelled out for all to see. ?You'll read about how each species of fish is specifically cut to maximize it's enjoyment and about how the Master will fabricate sushi to appropriately fit the size of each diner's mouth.... fanatical stuff. Read the website, and you'll begin to understand how Sushi Yasuda is a place that worships all that is pure and glorious about fish. In this context, my night of horror blossomed... Wifey and I decided to go out for a fun dinner. ?We step into the austere and peaceful space that is Sushi Yasuda. ?Staff are gracious and very accomodating. ?Everything is set for a lovely night. Atrocity #1: Server: ?"We can have the omakase dinner include half sashimi and half sushi. ?Is there anything someone here cannot eat?" Wifey: ?"Well, I can't eat lamb..." Me: ?(turning bright red and trying to hide under the table) Atrocity #2 (midway into our meal): Server: ?"Is there anything else you would like?" Wifey: ?"Do you have a spider roll?" Me: ?(dying of shame) Atrocity #3 (at the end of our meal) Server: ?"How was your meal?" Wifey: ?"That wasn't enough sushi. ?I'm not full yet... I think I'll have some abalone and sea scallop." Me: ?"You're gonna stuff yourself with abalone!?!?!? Ounce for ounce, one of the most expensive items in the ocean!! ?For the love of god, please shoot me now! The meal was phenomenal. ?But my palate is just not sensitive enough to discern "amazingly fresh" sushi from "pretty fresh" sushi. ?Besides, we're probably on Master Yasuda's shit-list for the crap that wifey pulled in his restaurant. ?I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't let us in the door again.

Yasuda is the best sushi in New York. ?I have tried most all of the high end places excepting Masa (and at $400+ per person I am not likely to change that). ? The fish is pristine - sourced impeccably and presented beautifully. ? Make a reservation. ?Specify that you want to sit at the sushi bar in front of Yasuda-san. ? He really is the master, with great knife skills. ?He's not one to make a lot of small talk but will sound you out for what you like. The quality and variety of the fish are the strong points at Sushi Yasuda. ?There are several varieties of hamachi (yellowtail) and more grades of tuna and toro than I knew existed. ?Splurge on some chutoro, otoro and maguro to have a tuna tasting. ?Getting the opportunity to do a taste comparison between different varieties of the same fish, particularly of fish at this quality, is a unique experience. The meal can be quick but is delicious. ?A meal at Yasuda is not inexpensive but it blows other places out of the water. Service is top notch too. ?The waitresses will refill your cup of tea and even replace it with a new cup so that you don't have any cold tea in your glass. ?If you sit at the bar, order a couple of pieces at a time so that you can eat each piece as it arrives. If you want large pieces of fish draped over the sushi go to Yama or Japonica. ?Yasuda is not the land of the california roll. ?It is the fish of your dreams. ?So fresh you worry you might be in the splash zone. ?You may even close your eyes as you eat the bite size sushi and just let the flavor transport you away.

Ok, so they make incredibly fresh sushi. That's apparent being rolled right in front of you.. the rice is fluffy and warm and the fish itself is masterfully prepared. It's a great sushi experience and if you want top shelf sushi, this is definitely your place. It's fun to watch the chefs prepare it. It's fun to drink sake and plum wine. And it's fun to try all sorts of crazy rolls like the "tanzanian roll" or the liver roll. (pretty sure it wasn't called "The Liver Roll," but w/a glass of plum wine and 2 shots of sake under my belt, i wasn't about to write down the proper name) The sushi chefs and waiters alike are all extremely friendly and knowledgable. We even got the play-by-play on each piece as it was served. (not that I remember, but it was interesting nonetheless) And not that I needed the play-by-play bc it made me feel like I had to eat at the chef's pace, not my own. But throughout the commentary, we were told some pieces already had soy sauce on them, so we didn't need to dip. .....but I likes me some soy and let's just say I "forwent" the dipping bc I felt awkward and I didn't want to offend. (not that that's ever stopped me from dipping my filet into my heinz, but still.) ?.....(minus star) I was also a little thrown off seeing people eating the sushi with their hands! I was like, ....what? dipping your fingers in wasabi and eating the pieces with your hands? Really? I must be a sushi novice. I stuck with the sticks. While this is indubitably a fine sushi dining experience, I seem to prefer places where I can get my bottle of plum wine, some steamy hot edamame and all my rolls all at once so I can bask in the joy of a more leisurely drunken sushi soiree.

Does Sushi Yasuda really need another review? No... but I am going to write one anyway! The decor is simple, refined, and wood-based. Make sure you have a reservation - they turned away two walk-in parties in the five minutes I was waiting to be seated. The service, is of course, impeccable - they pull out chairs for you, they escort you to bathrooms, the chefs converse with you and entertain your questions, etc. I sat at the sushi bar and got the omakase: Shimaaji - Yellow tail. My first piece was amazing. It made me realize what I had been missing eating $1 sushi for months and months at a time. The fish didn't even taste like fish, it tasted like freaking magic melted on my tongue! Blue Fin Medium Fatty Tuna - Red in color. Compare this to regular Red tuna you usually get in fast food sushi places... you're right, you can't compare! The texture was soft and smooth, the taste was indescribably good. Toro - Pink in color. I cry when I think about this piece, because it was so delicious. This is butter in fish form. Never leave a great sushi place without it. Some other great pieces, that just melted in your mouth: Kinmedai - White Fish Fluke Sockeye Salmon White King Salmon Pompano Some more interesting pieces: Squid legs - These are boiled for a few seconds and drizzled with some sauce. The sauce tasted like the customary eel sauce. The consistency was that of orange clam. There was also a pinch of large crystals of salt. Overall, a dynamic piece that added some interesting flavor to the omakase. Giant Clam Himo - Himo means "muscle." The chef showed us the different pieces of clam we could get. The Himo is the muscle surrounding the organism. The "scallop" (adductor muscle) is the muscle connecting the two shells. The Himo tasted delicious - not tough, like muscle usually tastes. Kuchiko - When he presented this to us, he said, "These are guts, liver guts." Not too appetizing-sounding, but it tasted great. This one, which was red, tasted like a milder form of uni, and had a little more shape than uni. The white kuchiko I had tasted similar, but had a even tighter shape. Sea Scallop - The scallop tonight wasn't too fresh. The best scallop I have had recently is actually from Hibino! Uni - Mmmm. Don't try getting uni at fast food places, it will just make you sick. If you are going to try uni, try it here at Yasuda or 15 East - they will definitely make you a lover. Some notes - If you choose to get omakase and sit at the bar, you have to be out of there in an hour and a half. Remember to confirm your reservation the day before, they will cancel it if you do not. They will normally call you, but in case you don't get a call, call them. The dress here is somewhat eclectic - some people wear dresses and suits, others were jeans and sneakers - so really, it is up to you. Overall, a lovely night of sushi, if only I could have eaten more!

My only regret about this restaurant is coming on a Saturday. Every other day of the week owner and master Chef Yasuda is working his magic at the sushi bar. Amazing decor, a restaurant not too big or small and some how embodied a classic and modern look at the same time. best of all, it wasn't loud and you could hear yourself think. For $150 bucks I expect to be able to have a conversation with dinner. I ordered the Sushi Matsu, where you get 12 pieces of nigiri and half a roll. They have like multiple types of tuna salmon and more exotic fishes. The chefs circle on the menu what they recommended so i picked all of those. Also, I was told I had to try the sea urchin, which looks disgusting, but I am now a huge fan of. The chefs add wasabi and a drizzle of soy sauce to each piece of nigiri that they think is appropriate. some people might try to manipulate it but i eat it the way the chef prepared it, they are the experts. Every piece was awesome, I would eat one fish and be sad i didn't have another piece but once you eat the next one you are surprised by the new flavors. If i was more prepared and more thoughtful of my selection I probably would have ordered the omakase which the waiters are always pushing. Everyone else at my table ate the same thing, another person ordered Chirashi.. looked very good as well... another guy in our party who doesn't eat raw fish enjoyed watching us eat. don't walk in there and ask for beef teriyaki and california rolls. if there was ever a way to backhand slap someone with a stare it was the chef when he heard this ridiculous request. Make sure you order nigiri. rice is what makes sushi special and Yasuda has it right. definitely not kind to your wallet, but i think it is worth the splurge. Good Times, I will be back for more!

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! enuff said....if I could give this place 100 stars, I WOULD! First OFF, make reservations at least ONE to TWO weeks in advance. This place is packed and why is that?? because this place has the fresh-EST sushi I've ever had in my Life!!! My BF took me here the day after x-mas which is my BDAY and all i can say is I've been thinking about this sushi ever since and I want to bring all my friends to have the same experience I did. I can surely say that I cant eat anything else (sushi) comparable to this anymore..(My palates are so spoiled now) !!! We ordered the Omakase (chef's special) - the chef picks the fish to serve you...however, you are also given a menu to choose if you would like something in particular that you want the chef to make for you given that you are siting at the sushi bar. Most memorable fishes (they were all delicious and will melt in your mouth instantly): ~O-TORO ~White King Salmon ~Sea Urchin ~EBi ~tuna rolls (koi menu) Lastly, one thing I didnt like was that the waitress rushed us out after an hour and the chef did not seem too pleasant and not talkative, it would be nice if he could explain each fish and its background to the customer....given that i am still new to eating upscale sushi..I dont have much knowledge about the fish and its whereabouts..which will make the meal more interesting and conversational :D -------No Doubt that I will come back again...however, the bill came out to be almost 200 bucks...so perhaps on special occasions only..

Oh my. goodness. I went for the second time and was as blown away as the first. I tried the omakase both times at the bar (neither times was I served by Mr. Yasuda) but the other chefs are amazing. The sweet shrimp is seasonal (February, peeps) and one of the highlights and I have no words to describe how delicious and amazing every single piece of edible art the chef puts on your dish is. I am sure every place has great tomago, but I'd finish it off with that. So delish. Anticipate eating ramen the rest of your week if you go here and have to pay for yourself. IT IS SO AMAZING.

I'm almost positive that I've hit sushi snob status. ?I can't order "sushi deluxes" any more - not that I go to restaurants that even have that on their menu. ? Thus, I was only mildly excited about Sushi Yasuda despite the rave reviews. ?Fresh off my meal there, I am happy to report that I now have my "happy place" in Manhattan. ? Set in midtown amongst the high-rises of our financial crisis, I'm rather surprised to find such an amazing sushi experience since all of my great ones have been in hole in the wall spaces that smelled of sushi rice. ?Sushi Yasuda is set in a posh modern space that reminds you more of the W than of Tsukiji. ? Still, the moment you sit down at the sushi bar, I found myself whooshed back to Japan. ?The warm towel always does it for me. ?They also bring out a little wet towel that is scrunched up for use on your fingers. ?The chef encouraged us to use our hands to eat - the proper way to eat sushi. ?It was actually the first time that I did this during an entire meal and I must say that I LOVED it. ? We ordered the omakase, which isn't listed on the menu but our chef happily obliged us on our journey. ?Fifteen to twenty pieces later, I finally figured out where heaven really is. ?I can't remember all that we ate but amongst the highlights were: - East coast Tuna - It's lightly seared and not fat at all and yet amazingly smooth and tasty. ?They would get 5 stars on just this piece alone. ? - Florida eel - One of two pieces of eel that we ate and this one was soft, fresh and probably the best piece of eel I have ever eaten. ?I know that I can no longer compare fresh eel to the stuff you get frozen at most sushi restaurants. ?You owe it to yourself to try eel at a real sushi restaurant. ? - California Uni - Call me crazy but it just seemed to taste better here than even what I've had in California. ?Softer and more buttery with less of the "fishy" taste. ? - Japanese Mackerel - Perfection - Sardine-family fish - This was an interesting one - sort of a short digression from the norm but which kept the tastes varied so you weren't eating the same thing every time. ? - Scallion sprouts - After we asked the chef to end our meal, he asked if we would like to have this piece at the very end and we said sure. ?He pulled out the scallion sprouts out of a very small wooden box and proceeded to make pieces of sushi - adding I believe some salt and soy sauce. ?I'm not sure if it makes the perfect ending or if it would have been better in the middle but I loved it. ?I love trying new things and this was a prefect example. ?It completely changes your palate and in this case really helped us to wrap up our meal. ? We also had the usual toro, salmon, tuna and some other whitefishes (not as great). ?Our meal ended with a glass of hot black tea and we left feeling utterly satisfied. ?It really was an amazing sushi experience - completely deserved of a 5 star rating.

I give this five stars because this is what sushi eating should be. We ordered omakase, and the waiter asked if there were any fishes we did not like or want. So when we received our sushi and sashimi, there was more tuna then anything, which was very nice. OMAKASE ("chef's selection of fish) is the only way to go when you go to a sushi establishment such as this. Our platter included: (sashimi) clam, tuna, tuna, yellowtail, and two more fishes we didn't catch. (sushi) fatty tuna, scallop, salmon, and a few more again, that we didn't catch the name of. Lastly, there was eel, salmon roe, and a fatty tuna roll. The fish selected all have a really smooth and soft texture. This is how we enjoy our sushi the most. Bear in mind Yasuda is not cheap. Our bill was $134, without drinks, so it is definitely a "splurge" place. But we only dine at Yasuda when we travel into NYC, so I think it qualifies. BE SURE TO MAKE A RESERVATION, or go during an off hour. The last time we went, we had a reservation, but we walked in on monday at 12:30, and they would only seat us if we could finish by 1:30pm. Who tackles the Omakase at Yasuda? Someone who wants to enjoy truly terrific sushi, but who can also afford a $60 mean (and if you don't have a reservation, someone who has time to wait) Who takes a pass at Sushi Yasuda? Those who cannot stomach a $60 sushi experience (it really is an indulgence), and also sushi eaters who aren't willing to try whatever the chef selects for you.

Sushi Yasuda has been called a temple of sushi, and it deserves the title. Simple and spartan, both in decor and fare, you aren't going to find humongous rolls drenched in sauces. Rather, the sushi is presented and prepared in reverence and understated simplicity. Often when I go, I sit at the counter and avail myself to the sushi chef to select the best path for me. His selections have never led me astray. In a city where restaurants scream for attention, Sushi Yasuda simply sits and waits. There is no need to shout. The acolytes know their master well. Be warned, the price for worship is high, come with a well-padded wallet. Don't sully the experience by worrying (too much) about such insignificant material matters as the looming bill. http://www.sushiyasuda.c¡­

If I lived in New York and made a lot of money, I would become a regular here. I called about a month in advance and requested a table at the sushi bar, in front of Chef Yasuda. Being told there was a 90 minute limit to the meal was a bit off-putting, but I was prepared after reading other reviews online. Turns out, we only needed about 60 minutes to be stuffed full of fresh sushi (we also arrived before anyone else at 5:50pm and were seated immediately, and then started being served a few moments after that). We did omakase, where the chef picks fish for you. Don't do this if you're on a strict budget - it adds up quickly! We each ate 21 pieces before we knew it. Everything was incredibly fresh and Yasuda told us about each fish as he served it. Many were from various US states. We had 3 types of eel, which were among our favorites of the night. We were also able to try a few new things, such as sea urchin and several types of mackerel and clams. On top of that, there was 2 types of fatty tuna, 2 yellow tails, a couple of white fish, salmon, trout, toro, and salmon roe. I didn't particularly enjoy the texture of the clams or sea urchin, but it was fun to try something new. Everything else was wonderfully flavorful, creamy and fresh. It was really nice to be taken care of by the chef - no decisions to make, no worrying about missing out on something great. We were served a bit quickly at first, as we were the only ones at the sushi bar but as more people trickled in service slowed down. Chef Yasuda is pretty funny and entertaining too - easy to talk to, and he will start joking around and laughing loudly at his own jokes.

Not only my most enjoyable sushi restaurant experience, but the tastiest as well. ? Sat at the bar (only way to go, warning reservations are only held for 10 minutes so be punctual). ?And decided to do the $36 dinner menu with chef's choice of sushi and roll. ?This was probably the best decision of my life as I tasted some of the most amazing seafood imaginable and came away with a new found love for eel and sea urchin. ?The chef's choices were varied and really let the palette wander. ?In addition it provided us more time to enjoy ourselves as nothing was rushed and he only presented two pieces at a time. ? The entire evening was eating, chatting and watching our chef go to town not only on our order but others as well. ?I really am a sucker for watching the chef prepare things. ?Service was impeccable and while no alcohol was imbibed our green tea never went below half and dishes were cleaned immediately. Once we finished the run of the menu we asked the chef to continue feeding us (because we are gluttons). ?He whipped up some amazing pieces atop that rice which is nothing short of amazing (it just melts in your mouth). ? Total damage for 2 was really not bad at $112 + tip. ?i actually plan on going back by myself in a week or so once the craving for some amazing fish rises again.

I adore sushi and Sushi Yasuda is fantastic. It's slighty less expensive than Sushi Gari and in my opinion much fresher and tastier. Recommend sitting by the bar, the sushi chefs are knowledgable, the Sushi Matsu is really reasonably priced, and the sushi chef can recommend some sushi and sashami for you based on your likes and dislikes. Decor wise, it's on the plain, minimalist side, it's very much an after work dinner type of spot, bright lighting. It's not intimate and if you're going for a first date, I would say take her/him elsewhere. But if you want to go for great sushi and you've been dating for a little bit go to Sushi Yasuda for fantastic food. **************************************************?****************************** So I went again recently, on May 13, 2009 ?sooooooooooooooooo good. The best, I had this dreamy, fat, juicy, slighty salty oyster on rice. Oyster sushi and a bunch of other delectables. It was retarded. I've been dreaming about that meal for the last two weeks and must go back again soon! Definitely SIT AT THE BAR. Ask for Mr. Yasuda if you can. Ask the sushi chefs, what is fresh (everything) tell them what you like and don't like and they will make you the most amazing sushi you've ever had. Part of the secret is the lemon and sea salt they put on their sushi/sashimi. The other secret is the fish is so very fresh.. sweet meat I say.

Maybe my expectations were too high? ?Or maybe they were having an off day? ?I had lunch here with some wonderful company, but the food didn't knock my socks off. The decor is very pretty - clean lines, pale/neutral color palette and great zen atmosphere. ?The service was attentive, very accommodating and respectful. ?However, our server had a very high pitched mousy voice, so it was hard to hear her. The salad was nice and had the perfect citrus/ginger dressing (my favorite salad dressing). ?We all went for the price fix sushi/sashimi lunch. ?The sashimi/sushi on the other hand, was not as fresh as anticipated but had a lovely presentation. ?Mochi dessert was fantastic! ? I might come back if I was in the area, but there are so many other places to try that I probably wouldn't

I've long been pondering what my best sushi ever was, but now that I've eaten at Yasuda, the question is settled. My boyfriend and I were seated at the bar with chef Yoshikawa and hot towels and a seaweed appetizer appeared. At his suggestion, we ordered prix fixe sushi and sashimi meals, a total bargain at $20. We chose maguro, hamachi and spanish mackerel sashimi; eel, salmon, hamachi, sea scallop, sea bass, maguro and mackerel nigiri; and king salmon, hamachi and eel maki. Everything was divine. The eel was earthy and perfectly broiled. The tender scallop was accented with coarse sea salt. We just kept looking at each other in ecstasy. Yoshikawa seasoned the nigiri with fresh wasabi and house soy sauce, guiding us with instructions such as not to mix the wasabi with the soy sauce and to merely touch our maki to the soy, not dip. We had to have more. At Yoshi's suggestion, we had the creamy toro maki and rare white king salmon. Bold and chewy giant clam was followed by silky, ephemeral oyster. We rounded off the meal with another piece of the succulent eel. Truly love in the mouth. We had been prepared to do omakase, but I'm glad we didn't drop $300 when ordering off menu was less than $60 each all told. The prix fixe is an excellent deal, and anyone on a budget can stop there and get fed 10 times as well as at the standard sushi joint. It gets more expensive once you start going a la carte, but still totally reasonable at $4-5 a pop. The meal ended with more hot towels and some palette cleansing tea. Chef Yasuda wasn't there the night we came, but Yoshi could have been the star as far as I knew -- full of charming info such as the waters of origin of the coveted white salmon and the 15 grades of Japanese seaweed, of which Yasuda uses #2. I bow low to the chef.

What a terrible first impression. We were in the mood for sushi and excited to try Sushi Yasuda based on all we'd read. We hadn't made a reservation. Our error, of course, ?but we tend to freestyle and have ended up with the most fabulous meals that way. We stopped in anyway, and the man at the podium couldn't have been more condescending or unhelpful. I think out loud, so foolishly said, "Hmm, any other sushi around here?" He sneered at me and barked, "No." I know, I know - competition. But the question was rhetorical and his attitude already unappreciated. Immediately I knew I'd never come back and that it was a shame because by all accounts the food is fantastic. We ended up at 15 East and had a fabulous experience. We walked in and were seated right away, and will go back for the service as much as the incredible sushi, although it was very pricey. Lesson = don't treat people like you believe your own hype. A few irritated potential customers won't hurt this place's business at all, but being civil does help pad the karma bank, if you care about such things. No stars for unnecessary meanness that put me in a bad mood until we hit the Village.

Hmmmmm...I have to say that if I had paid for the meal here, I would probably withhold a star, but since I didn't, I could just enjoy the high-end but tiny pieces of sushi. I'm not going to lie. ?I like a little added something to my sushi: a squirt of yuzu, a tad of garnish, a bit of searing. ?Flavor enhancers. ?So while this fish was amazing and fresh, I felt that it was a little plain. ? Delicious, tiny, and plain.

My friend Phil L. says it best, so I'm going to steal his quote: "I love sushi...Therefore, I love Sushi Yasuda." It was the girlfriend and I's last night in NY, so of course we had to cap it off with an awesome dinner. Something bold like a fancy seafood joint? Maybe awesome 4 star Italian? Good old new American? Nah, sushi all the way. Unlike the trend towards lounge-errific, uber-trendy sushi joints, Sushi Yasuda is no frills, clean-cut, and amazingly unpretentious. Ok, so you have to make sure you reconfirm your reservation the day of, but that's about it. I unfortunately made my reservation too late to secure a spot at the sushi bar (my one regret), but they were nice enough to let me know that they would put my name down in case someone canceled. Alas, no one did. While the sushi bar is clearly the place to be, our waiter was plenty nice. He checked on us frequently and explained the menu as requested. We were plenty confused by the ordering process, and while we enjoy sushi, we clearly aren't Japanese fish connoisseurs. But our waiter was a trooper and stuck it out with us anyway. The best way to order is by the little red marks next to the sushi menu; those are the chef's picks for freshest fish. And when Sushi Yasuda claims that, it's no joke--if this isn't the freshest sushi you've ever eaten, you should request your money back. As it's now been a month since eating there (reviewing all these places takes time!), I can hardly recall what we ordered. We've got the pictures, though. A few highlights: the flash fried soft shell crab appetizer (pricey at around $17, but tasted incredible), a particular cut of yellowtail (can't remember exactly which one), and eel (I'm not a huge fan, but I think Yasuda just turned me into one). My suggestion is to start small and order a few things to see what you like. Then go for round two (or three...four...etc.). It's hard to quantify your costs that way, but if you're here, why put a price on some of the best sushi you'll ever eat? Anyways, even with a drink each (plum wine for her, Sapporo for me), the bill came out to just $125. I was expecting to spend much more. Regardless, it was worth every penny.

I'm a little speech/wordless. Really, I've thought over and over about what to say about this place. There just isn't one way to describe my experience. You simply need to come here and try Sushi Yasuda yourself. Your tastebuds, senses and everything you know and didn't know about sushi will change. Sit at the bar. And let the chefs lead the way. The two of us decided to forego the menu. The sushi on the a la carte order form was already grouped under the headings of salmon, trout, tuna, etc., with two to five different kinds of each. There were also small red circles around certain ones indicating the chef's recommendations. We just told our chef - Japan-trained - what groups of fish we liked. Tuna - 2 kinds Yellowtail Mackerel Trout Salmon - 2 kinds Toro - 2 kinds Eel - 2 pieces, cooked Scallop - dab of salt on top Squid Uni Salmon roe Each piece was presented one at a time, was taken one mouthful at a time, and made me stop and think. The fish was probably the size of your thumb at times, the rice underneath an even smaller roll - but OH, so beautiful, fresh and pristine to the taste and presentation. The tuna melted in my mouth, the salmon tickled with robust flavor, the uni could make a sushi lover swoon. The cooked eel was unworldly, the scallop was clear liquid - so sweet and so fresh, the toro was dreamy. Quality was incredible. We basically ate until we were full and had to tell the chef to stop. Working with quick, skilled hands, our chef described the traditional way of preparing the sushi with a dab of wasabi btwn the fish and rice. So I never touched any soy sauce or wasabi. The only thing I handled was chopsticks and my cup of green tea. Service was fantastic. I even had my carry-on luggage with me, which they took care of immediately when I entered. The place has no name outside, so look for the signature fish above its building awning. A marvelous and uncommon sushi lover's utopia.

Mediocre FOOD, great service, artistic and clean environment, very cool sushi bar set up. (sit at the bar) FOOD - My best foodie friend and I came here for the sushi one night and decided to get the sushi and sashimi tasting menu option, where they give you 12 sushi's that you can choose. Since we were up for anything, we let the sushi chef choose the types of fish that he would use. To my knowledge we had tuna, unagi (which was actually the best one IMO), bonito, some kind of clam, some type of mackerel, and some other fish that I don't really remember. Overall though, the sushi pieces were fine, more on the side of not that memorable, not mind blowingly amazing though. DESSERT - for dessert we ordered a scoop of green tea ice cream. It was good (better than haagen daaz green tea ice cream in a pint) but nothing exceptional as well. ATMOSPHERE - the best part about the meal was sitting in front at the sushi bar and having your own sushi chef make the pieces in front of you as you eat and watch. The CHEFS are AMAZING and it is such a treat to be able to watch them create the sushi for you. They're quick, fast, and definitely know what they're doing. I wish I could sit there all day long and watch them work!! Besides that, the establishment was clean and well lit. Of course, it was also late at night (5 min before closing time) so it wasn't as crowded as other yelp reviews have mentioned. SERVICE - service was attentive and quick. they were also quick to bring out the next item or cutlery. No bad comments about it. Exceptional. The waiters, staff, and chefs seemed to be all authentically Japanese which makes the place more authentic and feels more home-like. ? OVERALL - the food and the dessert were good, but nothing spectacular or mind blowingly memorable, unlike many of the raves and reviews that I've heard from friends. The staff and service was exceptional, however, the food just was not, hence the 3 stars. Would recommend for those that like their rice to be individual pieces with entertaining sushi chefs. The fish was also fresh (no fish-y smell). You definitely get higher quality sushi, just in smaller amounts.

Overrated and pricey, the Zagat hyped Sushi Yasuda serves tiny sushi that is composed of thinly sliced fish glued to the rice by overly large portion of wasabi. ?Perhaps I just can't quite appreciate what makes this restaurant unique, its wide selection of domestic fish and its specially prepared domestically grown sushi rice. ? Obviously not serving to the Japanese clientele, the English only menus are confusing (main menu, sushi a la carte menu, special set sushi menus with pencil marks everywhere) and do not offer any guide to their proud selection of non-traditional domestic fish. ?Don't expect much help from the waitress as she would only point to the red pen circled "today's recommendation" from the a la carte menu and in my case, she provided the wrong information about the ingredients included in the chirashi. ?The fish is indeed very fresh (as you would expect from any restaurant charging this price) and selection unlike any I had before. ?However, I agree with Larry that none of these special sushi were memorable. ?As for the Yasuda's "scientifically" precisely prepared sushi rice, it's decent but not as impressive as the restaurant has claimed. Warning, stay away from the miso soup. ?For $6, I expected the soup base to be made from exquisite dashi and of decent portion. ?Instead, the only ingredient worth mentioning was the few tiny pieces of nameko mushrooms and the soup was served in a tiny chawanmushi sized cup. Yasuda's decor is clean, nontraditional and upscale and its atmosphere business like. ?The chef and staff is another very distinct characteristic of Sushi Yasuda as some of its Maitre D's and sushi chefs somehow slightly resemble the yakuza (dress code, hair style, attitude, choice of words, etc.) which certainly makes an awkward but interesting dining experience. ?Overall, my recommendation is, if you are willing to pay this price for sushi and looking for upscale service, go to Ichimura or Sushiden.

The space is nice, very sleek and minimalist, but we could have been in a dungeon for all I care, as long as Yasuda kept feeding my friends and I. This is the best sushi I've had in my life. How am I going to eat sushi again? I had called about a month ago, and secured a spot at the counter with Yasuda for a small birthday dinner party of 3. They warned me that I would have to take a 6p.m. reservation and give my spot up by 8 p.m., but I was prepared from reading the warnings here. My friends and I arrived promptly, used the warm hand towel - ?and Yasuda asked : "Can i start the sushi now?" ?To which we enthusiastically responded "YES". We let Mr. Yasuda choose what we were going to eat, ignoring the menu they placed by our plates. ?Watching him work is truly awe inspiring - he's definitly an artist. His hands are nimble and deftly compose your sushi- ?piece after piece of perfectly seasoned/cooked sushi rice, perfect fish, perfect seasoning, just the right size and shape for the one bite of heaven you're going to consume. ?There was uni, and different types of tuna, eel, yellowtail, salmon, oysters, squid, clams, fluke, trout, shrimp, house cured salmon roe (and I'm sure more, except I was too busy eating to write it all down) ?- all of the fish was so fresh and flavorful, and different. I've never liked mackerel, or raw clams, but Yasuda has convinced me that all fish deserve a spot in my belly. ? Yasuda is also very funny and informative, instructing you how to eat your sushi (gently, not in a mean way), telling you where the fish was from, and telling anectodal tales all the while. He's a delight. We didn't order anything else, but a lot of that day's dishes looked good as well - the couple next to us had the soft shell crab appetizer and it looked perfect as well, and they seemed to enjoy it. The service is good too, they are seriously like ghosts, whisking away dishes and refilling glasses quietly. ?The time limit isnt a big deal - honestly, we barely spoke because we were just watching him work. The rest of the sushi chefs looked just as efficient, and their customers looked happy as well, so I wouldn't hesitate to go, even if you can't get chef Yasuda - the fish is still going to be of the highest caliber. The meal was expensive, but not outlandishly so, and it was totally worth it. You could control the price more if you ordered the pieces you wanted and ?stopped at a certain point - the pieces run $5-$9 a piece, so just plan accordingly if you want to keep it a little more reasonable - we just decided to keep going until we couldn't anymore. I can't wait to go back.

Well, It's 4:09am and it's been about 7 hours since I took my last bite of the most amazing Uni I have ever had the pleasure to try. I think I've had a smile on my face the second I left and it's still ear to ear well into the wee hour of Tuesday morning. We made a reservation for 7:30pm to sit with Yoshi and it really was a 4+ star experience. We left our meal in his hands and he did not let us down. The most memorable pieces of nigiri of the night were the Oyster, Scallop Liver, Bonito, Orange Clam, Uni, White Salmon, and the Toro Roll. I usually am not one for the rolls, but Yoshi insisted we try this as the nori used to make it is of the second highest grade in Japan. I guess there is a rating system from 1-15 (one being the best and 15 the worst) and the nori used at Yasuda is a 2. The top rated nori is always bought out by one company who reserves it for government officials, etc... Yasuda also takes great pride in it's rice used for all nigiri. Yoshi reminded us that rice makes up for well over 50% of the piece so it better be damn good. And it was. The Damage: 22 piece Nigiri Omakase 3 Carafes of Sake $150.00 per person after tax and tip. Well worth it, and will do it again soon.

The otoro was better at Matsuhisa in Los Angeles, but the Santa Barbara uni was better here? Huh? Go figure. Still amazing though.

Foodies love and respect food as more than just a tummy satisfying experience..we treat it as an artform. The preparation, the ingredients, the taste, the smells, the history. There is no other food that embodies this more than sushi, and few people understand this as well as Chef Yasuda. My boyfriend and I have been to our fair share of sushi establishments and from all this experience, we've learned that there is only one way to truly enjoy sushi at its finest which is at the bar under the watchful and attending eye of the sushi chef. We made our reservations with Chef Yasuda for our belated Valentine's date, each ordered the prix fixe 12 piece sushi and half roll along with various a la carte sushi to our liking. I won't go into vivid detail of all the individual sushi we had, bc there are plenty of yelp reviews for that. Needless to say, the sushi was fresh and buttery, and melted in my mouth. Chef Yasuda took great care in achieving the perfect balance of fish, rice, wasabi, and soy sauce. He dabbed the soy sauce on himself with a paintbrush and instructed us on when dipping in soy sauce was necessary. Every piece came with an instruction, a lesson, and more importantly a history. He understood the fish he so delicately pieced together and gave it the tender loving care that it deserved. Any man that is clearly passionate and respectful of the artform that is food, that in itself should be respected and awarded 5 stars. And with that I give a toast to Sushi Yasuda, not only for the food (which so greatly satisfied my hunger for fine sushi), but for the wonderful experience that reminds me why food has become my pastime and my passion.

I'm not even sure where to start on this place. Was taken here for my birthday and was absolutely blown away. The fish was so fresh, so tender. I can take down a lot of sushi (and would've loved to eat my weight in this stuff), but none I've ever wanted to savor more than this. Sublime, I tell you. The only thing I'd detract from it was that there wasn't wine outside of plum wine; beer and sake, only.

Finally writing a review after over a year so will only be focusing on the more memorable pieces from my omakase experience. Really wanted to sit at the sushi bar but had to settle for a table. From what I understand, the place to be is the sushi bar if you're doing omakase. Yasuda was definitely the most amazing sushi experience I've ever had but the only reason I'm not giving it a five is because of a few disappointing pieces. Was not a big fan of the clam or yellowtail at all. It wasn't just so-so - I really wish I hadn't wasted taste buds on those two pieces. Now on to the good stuff. There were two kinds of salmon. Whichever was the one from Alaska gave me an out of body experience it was so good. I ordered several extras of those. I'm not a huge fan of tuna but Yasuda's toro made me a temporary fan it was so smooth and buttery. But the biggest surprise was how much I loved the uni. I never eat uni - I think it's gross and slimy. But Yasuda's was the freshest, cleanest tasting uni I had ever tried. It tasted of the sea. I ordered several more of those as well. Overall with the exception of a few unfortunate pieces, it was the ultimate sushi experience.

I walked in the door and wasn't sure I was in the right place -- it wasn't fancy, didn't have low light, or wasn't the scene I had expected given the recommendations I had received about the quality of the food. The soft wood tones were inviting and comfortable. The light was a bit harsh, but I got used to that. I spent a month in Japan last year and this is some of the best sushi I have had since I got back to the United States. I think that any high-end sushi restaurant should be judged on two dimensions: selection and quality. Sushi Yasuda shines on both. The only way to truly experience the greatness of Yasuda is to sit at the sushi bar and let them work their magic for you. Simply put, this was the most pleasant nigiri omikase experience I have ever had. The pace of dishes was good, the variety was great, and as the night wore on I started getting fish that I had never seen (or even heard of) before. This is not a cheap night out. But believe me it's worth it. Service is great, as is the food. Well worth counting your pennies or eating ramen for a few days to be able to check out Yasuda.

The best sushi in New York after Masa. Sit at the sushi bar and let Yasuda, or one of the many chefs behind the counter guide you through some of the best omakase that I have ever eaten. What's more is that the prices aren't ridiculous - $4-7 for the typical piece, which means you'll end up spending ~$100 on a good meal, as opposed to well north of that at comparable restaurants. Big, glass windows welcome into a sleek, wood-panelled eatery, with a long traditional looking bar at the center. Here, for a strict 90 minutes (reservations are for an hour and a half only), you'll experience some tremendous food. Tuna is one of the specialties (ask for a "flight" and you won't be disappointed). Other sushi highlights include the Uni, the Hamachi, the Kenmedai, and the Big-Eye. This all said, Yasuda will highlight the "best of the day" fish on the menu with red circles: follow his advice and you'll have the best possible experience. In terms of appetizers, the friend soft-shell crab is incredible. Not oily or greasy but perfectly crispy and sweet. You'll be best served, however, sticking to the sushi - the undisputed king of this menu. Mochi ice cream is a delightful way to close the meal (with Green Tea being especially good). Just make sure you're staying within your 90 minute time slot or you won't be allowed to order! Sake list is sufficiently extensive and well-priced. The carafes are ornate and beautiful. You'll go through at least a couple, I'm sure - as you naviate through the extensive sushi menu.

The first thing I thought when I walked in was, "wow, there is a lot of bamboo and this place looks really, really clean." The staff here are extremely professional. ?They know their food like the back of their hand and offers good advice on what to get. They also have a great selection of fish. ?I was able to order both urchin from California and urchin from Japan! Although I was too excited to eat it that I couldn't remember which was which when the waiter told me.

I have been a loyal customer of Sushi Yasuda for years and have recommended this place to countless friends, clients, and colleagues. ?However, the reservation staff is extremely rude and condescending. ?They speak to you like you've never made a reservation before. ?I called for a reservation yesterday and the guy practically bit my ear off asking 'WHEN, WHAT TIME, WHAT DAY?!?" like I was a complete idiot. Management should really consider reigning in their reservation staff. ?I've talked to many friends about this problem and we all agree. ?Your sushi is good, but I can take my money elsewhere, thank you very much.

One thing about this place - very, very expensive though does tend to fill up with the Manhattan lunch crowd. I sat at the bar and ordered the omakase. Cost about double what omakase usually cost me. One thing that was great about this place that I definitely remember is the oyster with salt. Very good and very different

I would commit a felony for this meal. ?One of the best sushi experiences you can have in the country. ?Not cheap, but also not outrageously expensive considering the quality. Yasuda is known for the rice. ?Skip the sashimi and go straight for the sushi. ?The premium you're paying for is the rice + fish combination which = sushi heaven. ? Temperature of the fish is perfect (too many places serve ice cold sushi). ?Rice is unparalleled. ?Cut is superb (everything is sooo tender). ?The eel is unlike 99% of the eel you get at sushi bars. ?It is fresh and is Yasuda's specialty. ?Salmon roe is also done in house and is amazing. ?Tuna* is ridiculous. Had the omakase (chef's choice) at the sushi bar last time i went. ?20+ pieces of different fish for ~$150 after tax+tip. ?Not a bad deal considering the quality. ? Note - sushi neophytes would be better off elsewhere. ?This place is quite costly and if you don't appreciate pure and traditional sushi, save the money. ? *Yes, they unabashedly serve (endangered) bluefin tuna. ?And I ate it. ?And loved it. ?Sorry mother nature.

After having heard this is the best sushi in the states, NYC..etc..I feel like I expected a WHOLE lot. For starters: I am a huge sushi fan, but mostly the interesting maki rolls (Philadelphia roll, rainbow roll, etc)...Sushi Yasuda does NOT offer any of these. This was my only let down. There is nothing provided in the maki except for actual fish. (No special rolls, mango, cream cheese, etc). If you are looking for authenticity and fresh flavor, this is the place to go. The fish literally melts in your mouth, the Sake is amazing. Our waitress was pretty unacknowledged and had zero clue what we were saying, which is why I didn't give this five stars. My only suggestion is that they could mix up the menu some more with some interesting and fun maki.

I think that it is wonderful that Sushi has become something more of a fixture than a fad in America. I also think that there are many interpretations of the experience that are valid and unique. Still I feel there is something valuable about honoring traditions. If you truly love Sushi in the Japanese tradition this is the place to go. If you mix tons of wasabi paste in your soy sauce, if think that fat sliced pieces, or flashy maki are what it's about you won't like this place. I have been going here since 2001 and every time I know I'm going to be in town I try to work a visit in. I take sashimi first and I have never been disappointed with the freshness or quality. I usually order some toro if available and move to nigiri then maki/ hand rolls. The important thing is to respect tradition and let yourself have a relaxing more traditional experience. * Clean understated decor * Shaved wasabi not paste * Tuna lovers delight * make reservations, sit at the counter at least once

For sashimi, I would go to Tomoe or Blue Ribbon, BUT For sushi that will fill your soul and put tears in your eyes, Sushi Yasuda is the ONLY place for me. ? For the best experience, make a reservation to sit at the sushi bar where and when Master Yasuda will be serving. ?Do not ask for sashimi or your typical California rolls or such as his specialty is sushi and only sushi. ? Master Yasuda will ask you what you like and dislike the most and he will recommend certain selections based on that. His soy sauce and wasabe are home made. ?He will inform you which pieces you should and shouldn't use with soy sauce. I have been there twice and both times I have been very pleased. Go with the flow and you will have an enchanting experience. ?Definitely not a place for bargain hunters. The restaurant's ambience is chic and trendy with a sense of serenity. If you are a sushi and sashimi purist and hate eating sushi and sashimi at so-called (Chinese or Korean owned) Japanese restaurants then this is the place for you.

My background is on Hunting fish. Hunting and killing and eating and searching for the freshest fish(es) possible. ?No sushi restaurant can properly replicate a fresher fish than procuring it from the water oneself. ?Unfortunately, I am severely handicapped when it comes to Sashimi. ?Sushi, however, is a different story because it's about the rice, the soy/ponzu/whatever they put on (minimalist is best). ?I love sushi purists that stay true, like Sasabune, Echigo, Sushi Zo in LA. UNI All Uni in any decent California establishment (actually, the best) come from Santa Barbara Island which has colder more temperate waters. SBI Uni is awesome. However, Alaskan (Yasuda) Uni is unfuking believable. RICE Their rice was a bit hard today and not the best I've had, which was a bit of a letdown given their rice is supposed to be fantastic. EEL Yasuda's training in eel is readily apparent. Had 3 types with Omakase. ? TAMAGO Enjoyed 2nd version of Tamago w/ Seaweed wrapped. ?MMmm. COPPER RIVER SALMON Harvested only 2 weeks out of the year. This is fantastic. YASUDA HIMSELF He has a strong disdain for pseudo japanese restaurants which offer nothing but a passport showing a japanese person but no respect for japanese culture or food. ?Yasuda sticks to tradition and does things right. ?"Congee without rice is not congee" "We have best oyster in the US" Girl and guy on a date sitting next to us. Girl says to the guy she doesn't want oyster. Guy to Yasuda: Just one oyster for me. ? Yasuda says: Oyster. Good for man. Guy chuckles. He needs all the help he can get. He is strong in his culture, knows his fish, and is informative, engaging, and entertaining. All things I want when I dine with a legendary Sushi Chef and the latter 3 items I did not receive while dining at Sushi Zo/Los Angeles. ? I also like the way he says to the customers who order by the menu (I prefer to let the artist/chef just "feed me") ... "Just order one piece. If you like, order more. I can make more for you. But just one and I make you more if you like." ?It puts the emphasis on the customer's wants as opposed to chef trying to push his own agenda GROUPER He knows a bit about grouper, which is my favorite fish. Unfortunately did not serve at this time of the year. TORO Medium Fatty Toro was good Extra Fatty Toro changed my life. It was the single best piece of fish I've ever had. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. ?My brother and I couldn't stop laughing (He's had the Toro there many times) at how stupidly good the Toro is. PRICE? Thought it was a great value. ?$200 Including Tax with 3 beers and Chef serving non-stop for the hour and half allotted. ?I think for sushi lovers 2 hours would be more agreeable. That was the price for TWO PEOPLE! Very happy Sincerely, Fishkiller.

So I finally made it to the place many have declared best sushi in NY. ?Environment was clean but maybe too clean almost like a museum. ?The seating arrangement also felt awkward as they have this big open space in the middle of the restaurant. I went with my buddy and we ordered basically pairs of recommended sushi off the menu. ?This included 2 types of Yellow Tail, 2 types of Eel, White Salmon, and Fatty Toro. ?They billed me for something called SHIRO which I can't remember what it was so check your bill before you go (someone mentioned on here they were overbilled). I tried really hard to taste the differences between the fish like the two Yellow Tails but I couldn't. ?They looked exactly the same too. ?My buddy said he could taste a little difference but who knew what was what again if you had to reorder? Another thing is the fish is too thin. ?It's seriously like LESS than half a centimeter. ?The eel was a nice portion but I didn't find the Shirayaki that good after reading some of the reviews on here to try it. I would stick to dark eel. After tax/tip: $100. ouch! That means bringing in lunch for a couple weeks! So we didn't get full and therefore decided to walk two blocks north to Hizen which was packed and lively.

Yasuda is grossly overrated. ?Yes, the fish is fresh and delicious, and yes, the chef flavors it so you don't have to dip it in soy sauce, but NO restaurant is worth the attitude they give you at the door and over the phone. ?I mean, come on. - common courtesy people. ?Just a pleasant demeanor or simply refraining from being extremely rude can go a long way. ?The reservationist was extrememly unpleasant. ? The service is attentive and good, and the sushi specials are quite a good deal. ?The toro scallion roll I had just blew me away - it was out of this world. ?The cuts of fish were good, regular sized and fresh. ? But give me Tomoe or Ushiwakamaru (if you want sushi-chef-flavored fish) any day over Yasuda. ?No, we didn't sit at the sushi bar and experience this wonderful delight that you call Yasuda up close and personal. ?But really, I don't care. ?Its all about service to the customer when it comes down to it. ?I choose to take my business elsewhere and would not recommend this place to anyone.

When 8:15 rolls around, its my 25th Birthday and I'm sitting at a Sushi Bar looking a Chef Yasuda I know that this prolonged NYC engagement is definitely worth it. To be completely honest was a little intimated by the entire setting. ?Living in the midwest I rarely see 28 (zagat) sushi. ?Before I sat down knew I was in for a something extraordinary My Advice: ?Let them walk you through it (if you are a resident foodie and have eaten numerous $250 dollar meals read on to the next review) ?this was special to me. ?Let them tell you what is fresh, let them instruct you how much soy to use, let them tell you how it should be done...because they are right.

I took my bf here for his birthday recently. Made reservations 5-6 days in advance. We sat at the bar and had Yasuda himself as our chef. We pretty much left it up to him, and pointed out what we especially liked. it was a completely enlightening experience, the preparation of each piece was simple and the flavors were delicate. Yasuda let us know when there was already soy sauce in the sushi so that we dont over-do it. We were both mmmm-ing away after each piece. everything was exceptional and fresh and super tasty. My favorite part was when the chef would give us some background as to each piece we would eat, where it came from, why its the best there and how to eat it..he would also tell us the heath benefits of certain foods! I loved that i learned so much about sushi that night. It was a delicious and fun experience, its a bit expensive but worth every penny.

YUM! A clean, sparsely filled room of light wood paneling. ?Quiet. ?Not many tables, lots of blank space for servers to swiftly move back and forth between the sushi bar and hungry patrons. We had an 8:00 reservation and were seated immediately upon arrival. ?Warm towels, a carafe of warm sake and we were settled into our comfortable booth. The chef's complimentary appetizer was seaweed and radish. ?Don't knock it till you try it; what I would have expected to be flavorless crunch was actually quite good and quite surprising. ?A great start to the meal. Miso soup was good, if typical. ?We had two hot apps--fried eel skin and egg custard. ?The eel was cut into long skinny strips, and both looked and tasted like eel french fries. ?I like eel, but this was just bleh. ?I would have preferred more of the seaweed and radish. ? I had done my yelp homework and knew we were going with the omakase (chef's selections of sashimi). ?Our waitress expertly informed us that they recommended 10 pieces per person. ?Fine, easy enough. The fish was all of exceptional quality and very flavorful. ?I liked that each piece had a tiny dab of wasabi on it. ?Unfortunately my dining partner isn't quite as much a fan of spicy mustard as I and didn't appreciate it. ?However, when we tasted he toro, our complaints evaporated. ?This was hands-down the best fatty tuna I've ever tasted. ?Eye-popping good. ?Delicious. ?Superb. ?Need more synonyms? ?You get the point. Then, the egg custard came 20 minutes later after our sashimi was already half eaten. ?A oversight that shouldn't have happened in a restaurant of this quality. ?I had forgotten about that appetizer, still mesmerized by the toro. ?I like custard but coming off the toro, it was disappointing (although anything at that point probably would have been). ?Perhaps if we'd gotten the custard first, the momentum would have successfully continued to build. ?As it was, it kind of fell flat. All totaled our bill came to around $80 per person. ?Not exactly eating on the cheap but I had expected more after what I'd read. ?Maybe because we decided to forgo dessert? ?Anyway that was a pleasant surprise. Now, let me be clear: ?this is not the place for you if you spell crab with a "k" and prefer your sushi deep fried with cream cheese or spicy sauce. ?At Yasuda, the fish speaks for itself and is served unadulterated by fillers and fat which create false flavors and mask inferior fish. ?Not at Yasuda; this is a sushi restaurant for purists.

Pretty sure that I had some of the freshest and best sushi ever at Sushi Yasuda on September 2nd. We made reservations which I almost feel are mandatory as I noted that every surrounding table that was unoccupied had a reserved sign on it. We were sat immediately and brought hot wet towels to wash our hands upon sitting down. We ordered the sushi and sashimi platters and allowed the chef to pick . The only downside to this is that there was one of every kind so it was hard for me and Armin L to split pieces down the middle. Every type was delicious and savory. We were still a little hungry so we ordered some fatty salmon and crab sushi along with a salmon and sawani roll with additional avacado. The sawani was my fave and I have never had it before. It reminded of the eel in its sweetness but had no additional sauce on it and it is served warm. We also had the flash fried prawns and an order of edamame both of which were satisfying and fresh. We ordered a white wine (there is only one option for white pinot grigio) but even without options, this wine was still light and refreshing. While we were dining the waitress overheard that it was my birthday and after we were done eating, came over with sliced papaya, pineapple and kiwi with a candle in it. She sang one line of happy birthday but then said she wouldn't subject us to anymore than that. In the end the service was excellent, the food great and the vibe very casual and comfortable. Although we sat at the table I know next time I will definitely sit at the bar which seemed rather exciting from my vantage point.

Stay far away if you've been happy with subpar sushi and don't want to be faced with what it should be (Teriyaki Boy comes to mind). Sushi Yasuda brings to light what fresh sashimi or sushi should be and what is apparent at Yasuda is the simplicity of it. ?There aren't creative rolls made in left field here. ?No, you won't find any cream cheese rolls either. ?What you should expect and will receive are immaculate pieces of sushi/sashimi that would never swim their way to any other sushi restaurant's menu. We had the omakase which is probably the way to go given the number of different pieces of sushi they have to offer. ?Unknown to me during dinner, Chef Yasuda was our chef at the sushi bar and he could have sold water to a well. ?Listening to him interact with the customers was part of what made the dinner wonderful. ?Based on his recommendations on what sushi was good and how to eat them to how much wasabi to place on them rounded out this incredible dining experience. For instance, we were told that the soy sauce was unlike any other soy sauce because of the blend of soy and sake.. yes, true to his word, it didn't taste like commercial soy sauce. ?The wasabi was made from fresh root and while a bit more subtle than the paste that we receive from supermarket sushi, it is authentic and doesn't serve that tear enducing kick we are used to but a true wasabi ?taste. Usually I would like to check out other restaurants; this time, we made an appointment in 2 weeks to revisit Sushi Yasuda. ?Yes, it was that great!

While chatting with a shopper in Soho, he told me about an amazing place for spectacular Japanese food. He raved passionately about Sushi Yasuda. I thought I saw tears in his eyes. ? He told me he was a frequent diner, who heard Yasuda might be leaving New York. He convinced Yasuda to stay put, becoming a financial partner. A great story, I had to try this food. My date picked me up with his vintage motorcycle. It was summer, early evening. I was wearing my french lace dress. I didn't care. I held on to him and let the wind mess up my hair. We entered Sushi Yasuda to a Japanese welcome chorus. The owner I'd met in Soho wasn't in, but they treated us like rock stars anyway. Sitting at the bar, we were served small ceramic dishes with tasty appetizers. One after the other. I remember a steamy bowl of rich, red miso soup; total perfection. And the seaweed salad disappeared like candy. The sushi that followed was so fresh it melted in my mouth! ?I had every variation of vegetable sushi maki on the menu, and some that wasn't. While my date 'inhaled' unagi, salmon and an endless array of fresh fish sushi. Dessert was a gorgeous pastel sculpture of sorbets and ice cream. The service was royal, start to finish. And the love of the owners flavored the food. We were wowed, as we sped off into the night.

I think the best thing about this place is you can have a fantastic meal for $40 or $200. The sushi here is for purists, fresh tasting sushi that isn't dressed up with monster rolls or spicy sauces. Don't get me wrong, I'll still order salmon avo rolls at my neighborhood sushi take out but when I'm craving some quality fish this is the place to go. Sit at the sushi bar to watch the magic - Yasuda is eager to share info about his ingredients and and loves to joke around. They do an amazing job of sourcing the best ingredients. On a trip to Japan I swore I would never order uni in the US but the Santa Barbara uni here was amazing. I can't wait to go back.

I had somehow gotten it into my head that Yasuda served at the far right of the bar (additionally, boyfriend had called and requested Yasuda a few weeks earlier but they told us he was fully booked). It was only an HOUR into our fantastic, unbelievable meal that I innocently asked, "Excuse me, sir, but what is your name?" I had simply wanted to make sure we sat in front of our jovial, extremely passionate "sushi man" again. "My name is Yasuda," he said very slowly. "Naomichi Yasuda." OH.... god.... what an idiotic QUESTION! And worse, I thought he was messing with us because he had a twinkle in his eye. My boyfriend then whispered to me, "does that mean he's a relative?" Wait... why am I even admitting this on yelp again? I'm completely demolishing any credibility (if any) I've ever had! Admittedly, I had no access to Yelp the day of my reservation (work blocks yelp -- boo!!), but that is certainly no excuse to be completely unedu-ma-cated! I was completely totally in SHAME. And then the pieces started falling together... the extreme passion for his craft... the exquisite sushi & really the soul of the restaurant - that RICE! It explained why he was so exacting in how we ate every piece; how he lectured everyone who attempted to order sashimi that it was not "traditional old japan style"; and his vast knowledge over well.... everything sushi! You have to give up yourself for that hour & a half to eat at Yasuda. You have to be willing to try, experiment, and to give up all social inclinations to have a conversation with the person next to you, even if you do happen to be celebrating a very special occasion. For to eat a Yasuda is to learn. If you don't like to be bothered and prefer to just catch up with friends over a meal, Yasuda is not for you. An innocent comment that Yasuda overhears can turn into a 20 minute history lesson on how Man crafted fictional reasons to explain why women were inferior sushi chefs. That comment, btw, was simply because I had heard that your hand temperature can affect the taste of the fish. And though Sushi Yasuda can be quite pricey if you order a la carte (and if that a la carte selection includes the TWENTY different types of toro on selection) they have fantastic prix fixe menus that are perfectly reasonable, or, dare I say... cheap! $36 for 12 pieces of sushi & half a roll... we let "the chef" (in this case, Yasuda-san himself) decide, it included uni (2 kinds), scallop, and squid legs. On top of that we ordered 4-5 pieces a la carte each simply because I wanted to try more things on the menu, which included otoro, eel, gensaba, pearl oyster, and sweet shrimp roe (definitely very interesting - the eggs are black!). The total, after drinks, app, mochi, tip+ tax came out to be $180. "Sushi" has forever been ruined for me, Yasuda-san, but I guess that simply means I need to come back many, many more times!

I do not like reviewing a sushi place until I have been there at least 3 times. I am damn picky about sushi but since I don't live here I will go ahead. Anyway, I had extremely high expectations for this place after getting recommendations and reading rave reviews from just about everyone I asked. I ordered everything a la carte. All of the sushi was extremely fresh and presented beautifully. I like the extra touch of a finger towel given to you for the nigiri. I have been told nigiri is meant to be eaten with your fingers, sashimi with chopsticks. The use of real wasabi is always appreciated. The only issue, or perhaps question, I had with the nigiri is why did he put salt on all of the clam and scallop pieces? Perhaps this is the way they are meant to be eaten? Well maybe, but it detracted away from the flavor. I might need to be reeducated. Anyway, I will definitely return the next time I am in NYC. All of the nigiri I had was delicious and to numerous to name. Update review coming in the future, I'm expecting the fifth star will be added.

For months, W has been raving, mad, crazy, speaking-in-tongues style praises for Yasuda, a sushi restaurant for which he is willing to travel across the country (Well, not really, but it is across the country for us....). ?Of course, i am desperate to try what he believes to be the best sushi place to which he has been in the country. ? As with all sushi restaurants, i feel it is best to go Omikase. ?We sat at the bar, so we were able to watch the selection and cutting process, which is a delight to me. ? Our opening was a special appetizer-like dish of seaweed with clam. ?The flavor had a bit of wasabi/mustardy/sake like flavor. ?Fantastic stuff. Starting, as the website recommends, with sashimi, we wandered through the common flavors one finds on all sushi menus. ?Some tunas, yellow tail, the like. ?After tasting these (among them a blue fin fatty tuna that made me forgo my feelings of guilt for eating a "red" fish for the night) we started in on the sushi where things got more interesting. ? There are some fish out there, that i have never tasted before. ?And they were all wonderful. ?Japanese Makerel, specially prepared-from-scratch eel, and a few Japanese fish that were very "fishy" fish whose names i can't remember. ?Hell, i enjoyed the sea urchin! As we were gorging ourselves on our never-ending fish pile that came as we finished each bit, I watched them make some of the sushi for other tables. ?The stuff that came out of there all seemed wishy-washy in comparison to what we were being served, and i can understand why some people would be less than impressed. ? But here I come back to my point about Hamako in San Fran: ?You have to care about fish to really like sushi. ?I'm not saying there's not a place for wrapping up deep fried anything into rolls the size of a baseball. ?I just don't believe that's the same thing. The care with which each part of the meal was treated was....well, like being at a 5-star Western restaurant where your silverware is being replaced regularly, your napkin is refolded when you come back from the bathroom and waiters serve from the right. ?It was just a different approach: ?The banana leaves as a presentation for the sashimi and changed out when the sushi was served was a nice touch. ?The moist towel to keep one's fingers from sticking to the sushi, the warm towels prior to starting each course, and the actual thought behind cutting a piece of fish the size of the person's mouth is just care and attention to the art of preparing food for the pleasure of eating. ? I'd like to add--this place is not necessarily better than HamaKo. ?Tetsuo and Junko are still my favorites because they, too, care about their meals, and their customers and do it in a small no frills environment without a lot of pomp. ?Also, i love it when Tetsuo proudly holds up his latest find at the local fish market (the sushi chefs at Yasuda wouldn't be caught dead doing this). ?But i will eat at Yasuda whenever i am in NY, as it has a huge selection of new things to try, has that NYC feel of being cool, and is some damned fine freaking fish. ? Incidentally: ?Make a reservation 72 hours before and make sure you call them back when they try to confirm with you...Otherwise, you forfeit your seating!

Speechless! ?Best Japanese experience hands down. ?We had a large group and split up into 2 groups at the sushi bar. ?It was pricey but it was really worth it. ?This was our first dinner and ended up my favorite meal of the trip. Here is a picture bill for 4 people: http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­

I've eaten here twice. ?Both experiences were fantastic & top notch. I ordered the omakase & sat at the bar both times. ?Once I told the chef my likes (in this case they were uni, mirugai & toro), the chef started making magical sushi pieces. ?While I liked most of my pieces, which were fresh & delish, I wasn't crazy about the mackerel. ?Altogether, each meal I consumed about 16-20 pieces. Regardless, good experience usually comes with a stiff price tag. ?Both meals were $115+ for one person. ?Good place to go splurge, especially when you have a corporate AmEx - so don't leave home without it! I recommend it highly!

DIVINE. i loved everything about this place. the service was excellent, the food was crazy good and the interior design was really clean We had the omakase option despite not being able to sit in front of the chef due to reserving just a couple hours before on a friday night. I fell in love with the blue fin tuna. their sashimi selection was excellent as well... I loved the salmon. Our waiter was very nice and attentive and came to clean up our dish right after each dish in a subtle manner, so you don't even notice her. I ended up spending about $277 after tax/tip for two, which consist of 30-40 pieces of sushi between us, an appetizer and dessert. I just wish I could sit at the sushi bar next time...

Came for my birthday dinner. ?All I can say is SOOOOOOO good! Only downfall? So expensive! But the experience was worth it. ?Everything here was so fresh, but service could have been a little better. ?Got the omakase, and some of the servers who brought the food was rushing so I couldn't hear half of the things they said. ?But otherwise, a great food experience!

Sushi Yasuda serves excellent no-frills sushi. If you want fancy sauces or elaborate preparation then you should go elsewhere (e.g., Sushi of Gari), but if you want the freshest most delicate seafood from all of the world's corners then this is the place for you. I have never had better nigiri.

The quality was really as good as it gets. We sat at the sushi bar and let the chef give us his picks. He kind of just randomly gave us stuff, so I would probably just pick my own next time, especially since it came out to about $250 for two people. But everything was very carefully crafted and looked authentic. I'd want to try the chirashi next time too. Yummmm... Toro!

Unbelievably simplistic and authentic. Sushi Yasuda is its own category when considering sushi. ? Although the prices are a bit high, it is completely worth it to slurge and pay a visit to Sushi Yasuda at least once. I suggest calling ahead to reserve a spot at the sushi bar to get the full experience. My boyfriend and I both asked for Omakase. ?Our sushi chef explained each piece of sushi that he presented to us. ?Each piece of fish was incredibly fresh and the rice was delicate and favorable. I would reccomend Sushi Yasuda to any sushi lover who is interested in having a traditional dining experience.

The House of Yasuda vs The A Train The servers are the epitomy of politeness. ?I have no manners. The King Salmon gave me pause with it's delicate texture and buttery finish. ?Owns any salmon I've ever bought. Their toilet tissue. ?Softer and firmer than any brand I've ever bought from anywhere. The end of the night, I had to refrain from asking the next table "Are you gonna finish that?" two pieces of nigiri. ?I'm glad nobody reads my reviews as they'd quickly find out how much ghetto-ness I have in my closet. ?Women would find I have no manners, my salmon sashimi is weaksauce, and I have shitty toilet paper in my bathroom. ?*sad face*

This is as good as it gets in New York. Everything that could be said has been said. Note: IMO, sitting with Yasuda himself is overrated, you end up having to share him with at least two other pairs of diners. And, well, I'm just a "all attention on me type of gal". Now gimme some uni!

Another great lunch at the counter of Yasuda. You are presented with a list of what fish is recommended today (and it is a big list with at least 3-4 varieties of salmon, tuna, mackerel, eel, etc) and you simply tell the chef behind the counter what you want and he remembers it and makes it for you. Yasuda himself is behind the counter and I have from time to time dined at his hands, but this time I had a different chef who was pretty good too. I started with some Orato and uni, then progressed to warasa, toro, aji, sake, king salmon from alaska, king salmon from new zealand, white king salmon from Alaska, 3 kinds of eel which may sound mundane, but are prepared on a charcoal grill when ordered and are topped with a special sauce making them full of umami type flavor. I am sure I am forgetting some items here and as usual, the sushi was top notch, though some items like the king salmon and eel are real standouts and warrant the $4.50 - $5/piece price. The person sitting next to me was also a sushi enthusiast (like most who visit this restaurant) and when one of us had that expression of bliss on our faces from a particularly good piece of sushi, the other would order it and I am glad we did this since it led me to try a few extra items. Even after consuming about 20 pieces of sushi one is not ?overly full as the pieces of sushi are bit sized like you see in Japan vs the oversized American ones. Can't wait to go back for some more and this time get the Monkfish liver appetizer.

Enough reviews here and why mine? I went after Mr. Yasuda officially left for Japan. I wanted to know how things changed if any, it was Saturday, January 8th at 6 pm reservation. We were seated the corner counter near the windows. It was a perfect spot to see Sushi chef making his creations. I started to chat with him. I found that he is living in NY for 10 years. This chef was a quite but fast. Found later at home, this chef was the successor, Mitsuru Tamura. My husband and I loved about first 10 Sushi he created. It's small but nicely compact and lightly marinated watery fresh fish. The chef said, we make our rice not too sweet so that customer can eat a lot. When this place got busy, quality of the Sushi sank drastically and also we hit the bottom of their fish choice. We tried all! But we did want more so I requested Red snapper and I said, if possible, love if you seared the skin lightly... but immediately his face became grim and said, "We don't have that tonight!". There was Tako, octopus, but he didn't serve us. I love Tako so I asked for it. I found after fist bite it was my mistake. There was a reason why he didn't want to serve us. It was tough. I guess, just eat what the chef recommends and if you finish all of the fish for the night, think back and request for what you liked. My husband asked for Uni and Eel. He found his love of Uni in Tsukiji in Tokyo. He finished everything even it was very early in the morning and it was our breakfast. For my repeat sushi order, I asked chef Tamura, the fish cheek sushi he served earlier. He explained what kind of fish but I was much blown away by this tender and melt in my moth fish and didn't remember the name of fish. This fish was seasoned very lightly allowing for a delicately flavor of the fish (snapper?) to shine and it was very bright! We felt variety of fish (no shellfish) and its preparation (seared, cured in soy or lightly boiled and so on) were missing that night. Oh! one point, the chef served us not that fresh fish. It was unpleasant but I ate it because it was in my mouth. The chef was definitely testing how much I know. His eyes were on me to see my reaction. But nice as I am, I couldn't say much even the chef asked me how it was, Yelpers! Don't be like me. Do mention anything not good. Chef might be testing of how much freshness of fish they can serve you. We asked for check before the time we were asked (or told?) to finish and leave. Total was $350 with tax and tip. For that price, I remembered enjoying eating Omakase at Ushiwakamaru on W. Houston St. Ushiwakamaru gave freshness, texture, variety and educational conversation of each fish with the chef (owner) but didn't enjoy much what's coming out from the kitchen.

Sushi Yasuda was a religious experience for me. I had been wanting to go for 4 months (I work near by) and when I finally did I had insanely high expectations. For myself, the visit was a pilgrimage to sushi-mecca. The experience was absolutely amazing. I found peace with the world around me: no wants, no desire, no anger, no frustration just simple, buttery, delicious fish. Okay, maybe a little desire and want, but only for more fish. The fatty tuna is the best single bite of food I've ever had. That's no hyperbole. The freshwater white eel served with salt and lemons is warm and wonderful. The flash fried crab is succulent. The Asahii draft is cold and perfect. The atmosphere is simple and elegant: bamboo floor, walls and ceilings with almost no other decorations. The waiter was kind and attentive. Overall the experience surpassed my expectations with delicious flying fish colors. The only down side is the insane bill you wind up dealing with when you leave, but don't let that bother you, think of it as donations to the greatest religion in the world: sushism.

Lets not mince words. ? It isn't often that I get to write a review for sushi. So let's start with what sushi is. Sushi is rice. Chef Yasuda knows rice. ? I could talk about the freshness of the fish and its buttery and flavorful presentation. ? But in truth, fish is really a supplement. ?Talk to the man. ?Make it a point to sit with him. ? He will even tell you that the sushi pieces are better than the sashimi. Order what you like, and then allow him to make decisions for you. ? Why you ask? ?Cause he is watching you. ?From there, your meal will only amplify your pleasure. After 518 Reviews I am sure you get the idea, although I will note, if you are asking for wasabi or eating rolls, you clearly have no clue what you are doing there in the first place, go home. Its the same as buying a computer and complaining that it doesn't work when you don't plug it in. ? Put it back in the box and tell them you are too stupid as a human being to own one.

We have dined at Sushi Yasuda before and had a positive experience. ?We were WOWed by the quality of food and services. HoWeVeR, this time around, it was a Big Disappointment. Lack customer service and Poor Quality food. Our waitress was unfriendly, perhaps it was her limited English ability. ?When asked her for guidance (the menu was Very Confusing), waitress shoved a list into my hands. ?Asked again about "Today's Specials," ?the curt waitress jabbed at the little red circles indicating "Today's Special." The 1st batch of sushi: the sushi rice was hard and cold. ?The 2nd batch, the rice was nice and soft, and warm. ? Conclusion: ?the 1st batch of sushi were made from left-over cold sushi rice that had been sitting around for awhile. Its really disappointing and sad that places like Sushi Yasuda served such poor quality of food. ?What's worse was that Chef Yasuda was In da Hoouse! ?Chef Yasuda was at the sushi bar entertaining & serving the "elite" guests. ?Maybe, he was not aware of the mediocre food his staff was dishing out to the rest of the guests. ?Surely, Chef Yasuda would not have approved. Sushi Yasuda received many positive reviews from the New York Times, Yelp reviewers, and foodie New Yorkers. ?It also received numerous awards and high ratings from prestigious institutions. ?WIth such high regards, ?we really wanted to be blown away by our food. ?We purposely took an out-of-town friend to Sushi Yasuda to experience Great Sushi, and Real Japanese food, that could only be found in New York City. ? Backdrop: Our friend thinks great sushi are those served in suburban malls. Doh! BUT, before you judge, he knows about Chef Yasuda and was super excited to try his food. ?He was thrilled-to-death when the staff told him Chef Yasuda was at the restaurant. Perhaps, it was wrong of us to have such high standards and expectation for Sushi Yasuda. ?Just because we experienced the WoW Factor once does not mean we will experience it again. ? Save your money. Don't waste your time.

This was actually a 3-star experience, but I had to downgrade it a star because of the Sushi Nazi host. I haven't tried to make a reservation here, but it is possible to get a table without a reservation. The ace up my sleeve - being with a native Japanese speaker. We were seated within minutes. The gaijin couple behind us who were in the same situation were curtly turned down; I felt a bit remorseful when we were seated next to an empty table for two that remained unoccupied all night. The sushi itself is good, but nothing like my favorite, Ushi Wakamaru - RIP. The Spanish mackerel was the best I've ever had, and I don't even like mackerel. Still, I don't think I'll be returning. I'll just keep sending Hideo from UW mental messages that he is missed. EDIT: Trumpets sound! I walked by Ushi Wakamaru today and it's open again!

Sushi here is definitely top notch, no question about that. But it still doesn't beat my favorite places in LA. I was also surprised by how inexpensive it was for the quality. Maybe good LA sushi is just more expensive on average. Got omakase, because I like to try stuff I've never had. Turns out Tasmanian trout is delicious. Our waitress was really great, attentive, and friendly. After I had eaten all the pieces on my plate, I asked her if she could tell me what all the different pieces were again. She had to re-copy everything down onto a piece of paper and went over everything with me again. Classy place. Make a reservation a week out.

So, I read all the reviews. And, I tempered them, because there's a lot of people who swear by this Sushi. And that's cool. We all gotta swear by something. So, I just got back from Sushi Yasuda. ?And I'm ready to give my grades. But, before I do, let's remember that I am not the aficionado of sushi that many others are. I'm a normal guy with normal tastebuds who has a penchant for finding good sushi. ?So, I don't mean to offend any who care to disagree. I'm just giving the Average Guy review for someone with an Above Average Appreciation for sushi. Greeting: A+ Greeted by at least two people who said "hello" and "welcome" right away. They handed me a menu and informed me that you, apparently, need a reservation for the sushi bar. However, they had a table for me, so I was good to go. Service: A+ Very helpful. Excellent timing. Perfectly executed service. Always at least one or more people with an eye on the table. No hesitation in subbing in and picking up a check, refilling ice water, picking up an empty plate, or picking up empty edamame pods. Presentation: A- Clean, light bamboo and modern atmosphere. Everything has that natural, finished bamboo (think natural birch color) appearance (walls, tables, floors). Glasses served on a bamboo pad. ?Chopsticks tilted on a black stone holder. The only knock I have on the presentation is the dishware. It was unmatched like white porcelain with blue designs... and then some earthy, brown clay like dishware. It just didn't match. It made a difference in presentation, hence the "minus" score. Food (Overall): B+ I never overgeneralize, here, so I'll list out what I had and how it fared: Appetizer 1: Flash Fried Prawn with Green Tea Powder - C Very average. Not much flavor. Salty. Texture was blah. Nothing exciting here, at all. ?Pricey at $9 for 3 small prawn. As I was chewing the last one, I was thinking : "this bite is soooo not worth $3". ?I could see these fairly priced at $6 at most. Appetizer 2: Edamame - A Ok. It's hard to muck up edamame. But, some places actually do. This was notable hot. Perfectly salty. I had to wait for them to cool. Fresh - not frozen (at least too many times). ?Not soft or squishy - perfect texture. Good amount. Pricey at $7. I could see fairly priced at $5, however. Drink: Diet Coke $4 for a small glass bottle in a small, round glass with no ice. Pricey. I could see fairly priced at $2.50. Roll: Rock Crab (with cucumber and avocado) - B+ Perfectly executed. Hard to muck this one up (basically a California Roll). However at almost $10 for a california roll that wasn't that much better than any other California roll, I just don't get it. ?The only knock on this one was that it was only like 4 pieces and smallish. ?They did blend the cucumber and softshell with the avocado in the roll, for what it's worth. ?Excellent taste. Great texture. But, still, a bit pricey for the portion. Roll: Eel - B+ They have 3 types of eel and I got the salty, lemony one vs the sweet one (Anago). It was good. Small roll for $10. 6 small pieces. ?But, to the other reviewers' point, "it was like butta"... in a good, sushi way.. it just melted in your mouth. Excellent. Ok, so that about wraps that up. So, the moral of the story is simply this: Good service isn't free. While the food is very good, it's overpriced. ?For less atmosphere and less quality of service, you can have a comparable sushi experience for less money. ?But, if service and atmosphere are your thing, this is your place - and a very good choice, indeed.

Yelp users gave Sushi Yasuda a very high rating, so I took my fianc¨¦ there on his 30th birthday. ?We trudged through the first snow anticipating mouthwatering sushi. ?In short, our experience was underwhelming. ? Each piece we ordered fell between $4-$8 and the hand rolls were between $7.50-$9.50. ?They gave us a sheet with recommended ngiri and sushi circled in red pen. The toro (fatty tuna) roll seemed to be very popular. ?My roll was flavorful but icy, like it had been thawing from the freezer. ?I've had better tuna hand rolls at Nijiya market in Los Angeles for a quarter of the cost. ?I agree with a previous Yelper that the presentation is sloppy. ? The fish was good - the salmon possibly the freshest I've tasted, but the rice was not good - I bit a hard piece in one of my ngiri. ?And the service was so-so. When you're paying for service based on the price of the food, you expect a certain level. ?Our sushi chef wasn't engaging, and our waitress made us feel rushed - saying it was last call for kitchen/dessert (mochi or ice cream) forty minutes after the start of our reservation. Overall, there are definitely better places to eat for the price. ?We paid over $200 and were no where near satisfied. I'm glad we tried it to see what the big deal was, but your money is best spent elsewhere.

This is a great standard for sushi in the US. It has high quality fresh fish, attentive staff and is very reasonable. Having lived in Tokyo for seven years, I feel it lacks the originality and personality that Tokyo's fine sushi dens have. It's not cozy and inspiring. Good sushi is all about the experience of sitting at the counter, chatting with the sushi master, letting him serve up whatever he likes and eating it with your hands. From this perspective, SY is a bit overrated.

Living in a city that is completely saturated with sushi joints, it is easy to stumble into a mediocre yet expensive place serving up flaming maki rolls smothered in funky sauces and nigiri cuts sloppily slung over rocks of rice. To me, this just isn't Sushi. Yasuda on the other hand, is the perfect embodiment of what sushi can and should be. Not only does Yasuda serve the freshest fish I have ever tasted, but the selection is absolutely mind-blowing (on a given night there may be 8 different kinds of Salmon to choose from alone). However, what truly sets this sushi apart from any other I have consumed is the rice. Yasuda himself has spent years perfecting his recipe using just the right combination of short and medium grain rice and his special blend of vinegars, sea salt and sugar. The result - nigiri that disintegrates the moment it hits your tongue. The sensation and feeling is inexplicable. My suggestion is make a reservation (a couple weeks in advance) for the sushi bar and request the master himself. If you wish, you may simply order off the menu by the piece/roll, but the best way to do it is let Yasuda map out your culinary journey as he is in tune with what's freshest and most divine. He may start you out with a few pieces of sashimi, then transition into some nigiri and finally a roll or two. Be forewarned, the sushi chefs will continue making you sushi until you tell them you are content. The first time I went I had a bit of sticker shock as I wound up with a $415 bill for just two of us. However, the experience can be as inexpensive or extravagant as you want it to be as they also offer a very reasonable pre fixe for around $35. Even if you are going on a budget, you must indulge in at least one piece of toro as it is truly unlike anything else. Other must haves are the BBQ Eel, Peace Passage Oyster and Uni. Whatever you do spend, it will be totally worth it and you will leave this sushi sanctuary with a smile on your face and the ocean on your tongue.

Best eel I've ever had, hands down. It was melt-in-your-mouth perfect. Before I go any further, I do need to say that people need to keep in mind where they are when rating this place. It's insanely expensive and trendy, so I won't even comment on prices. And that's just the thing. You walk in KNOWING you're gonna be dropping a lot of money on a meal, so really it's not even fair to use that in a review. That being said, this place is gorgeous. Floor to ceiling bamboo makes for a very impressive interior. Most of the staff was speaking Japanese to each other, which I loved hearing. The waiter was never more than 3 feet away from the table to wipe away dribbles, remove empty plates or bring another drink. They had some really interesting appetizers for the night I was there. A fried monkfish dish that was really good, and some sort of fish crisps that I didn't particularly care for. Just wasn't for me. All of the sushi we ordered was prepared perfectly and amazing quality. I enjoyed every bite! I doubt I will ever go back here simply because there are 100s of places to try in this city, and there's no reason to eat at the same fancy schmancy place twice. However, I do recommend it for sushi lovers. It was a wonderful pre-theater dinner that was just the right amount of food.

Okay, after eating here multiple times, I've finally bumped it up to five stars, permanently. ?Tonight, even after being absent for a couple months, Yasuda-san remembered what we always order, and even complimented my haircut ;) ?I especially enjoyed the two pieces of uni: one east coast, one west coast, both smacktabulous. I am so glad Michelle H. convinced me to give this place another go. Experience #1, see below. Experience #2, not quite ethereal, but much much better. ?We sat at the bar with Yasuda-san, which made a world of a difference. ?I think I have an automatic crush on all sushi chefs who speak to me in broken English about balance, striving for perfection, bratwurst and beer, and ugly hearts/faces/personalities. ?I ordered one of the set meals and had him choose all the pieces. ?Everything was fantastic, except for the squid. ?This place is most definitely rather expensive for the portions you receive, so don't expect to leave full and satisfied unless you've got deep pockets. ?The quality differential between my two visits is almost unbelievable! ?I'll only eat here again if I can sit at the bar with Yasuda-san! Experience #3, TBD. -previous review, rating two- So underwhelmed, I can't even believe it. First of all, this place is very "exclusive" and I've gotten major attitude several times when I tried to drop by without a reservation. ?Still, I've heard consistently wonderful things about the fish, so I was really excited when my friend surprised me with a birthday dinner here. ?We started out with the fish liver appetizer, which I enjoyed. ?Then we shared a sashimi plate and sushi plate with multiple fish. ?The striped bass and sea bass were very good, but the Spanish mackerel was slightly dessicated, the uni was wilty, and the salmon was subpar. ?Portions are tiny, and if we had enjoyed the food enough to order more, the tab may have become explosive. My friend and I will not be returning any time soon.

This is quite the expensive place, but the service is top-notch, from the man who slid open the second door, the waitstaff who held my chair as I sat, the extra tea cups of hot green tea as we ate, multiple people that check-in during your meal, and explanations of everything you want to know about. Very Japanese. Super polite, and very clean and proper. A hot towel before the meal, a wet napkin to the side, and swift replacement of anything dirty or finished. Accents can be a bit difficult to understand for some (my Korean friend had difficulty there). The sushi here is expensive, per piece, but definitely fresh and deliciously prepared -- as others have said, literally melt in your mouth. Everything can be done as sashimi. Particularly good were the multiple sizes of toro and many varieties of eel. Price fixe for a 4-piece and roll, though, plus soup or salad. Fruit dish was a great dessert - fresh pineapple, asian pear, and persimmon, all very sweet, and accompanied by a darker oolong tea for clearing out the taste without overwhelming. Wood and bamboo and very clean environments. Even the toothpicks looked like they were hand-carved out of bamboo. Superb location, service, and food. A bit expensive for a daily meal, but not too bad for a business meeting or meeting with close friends. Too bright for a date location, though.

Yasuda is one of those places where it is a crime not to sit at the bar and get omakase. You'll miss out on the experience of watching the amazing work going on behind the counter. ?I don't know about other people, but for me watching the effort that's behind the delicate piece of art that you're about to place into your mouth is part of the enjoyment. They always have the freshest of ingredients and talking with the chef you'll quickly learn the back story behind each piece of fish, grain of rice and its journey to your table. The decor in here is the typical understated yet uber cool minimalist layout that you can expect in most modern Japanese restaurants. ?The service, food and preparation however is of the typical precise, efficient and cultural traditions. ?An absolute perfect match. Surprisingly though, you'll find that you've probably paid much more elsewhere for much less. The prices here are certainly justified. Conveniently just half a block from Grand Central, it's easy to get to and close to a main hub. ?Definitely a destination restaurant that you should make the effort to try.

I'm gonna keep this kinda brief as this place is well reviewed. ?Remember back in the days when you used to watch the original DBZ (don't you dare lie to me)? ?The first time Goku powered up to Super Saiyan, you're like WOW. ?I feel like that's Oshima (http://www.yelp.com/biz/¡­). ?Then Gohan exceeded his dear old pop and became the first Super Saiyan 2, which is the likes of Ki (perhaps a later review?). ?At the time, you didn't think anything else would and could be better. ? WRONG. ?Out comes Bibidi and Majin Buu. ?Something out there must be stronger, better and powerful enough to stop him right? ?Right. ?At last, here comes Sushi Yasuda, who is the first and only Super Saiyan 3. ? (Once again, you have to think original DBZ) There is nothing bad I can say about this place at all. ?It's like liquid crystal melting in your mouth. ?Every pieces of sushi was pure butterly unadulterated goodness. ?(The Uni is to die for and this time I really meant it) A place like Yasuda does come with a hefty pricetag and sadly, I had to cough it up. ?Needless to say, I will be fasting for the coming months, but it's so worth it.

I'll be burned at the stake for this review. I went to Sushi Yasuda once, many moons ago. I didn't sit at the bar. We did not have the omakase. We ordered a la carte, and I did enjoy the meal. But what I remember most was the eel bone crackers. I recall eating a large variety of unique fish I had never had before, but I cannot remember any of them. My friends have better recollections than I. eGulleters rave about this place. For me, I'd go back for the eel bone crackers because it's all I can remember. Why don't more restaurants serve them?! Besides that, the service was impeccable. You feel like you're in another world. Some folks rail against monstrous sized portions, but every time I try to recall of the portions of sashimi I envision my thumbnail. Okay, so maybe every selection was ... three thumbnails, but when I can barely remember what I ate, I've got a problem.

I almost feel a little self-conscious writing a bad review of this place considering the level of awe so many others have had, but I must say that I was seriously underwhelmed. I brought some colleagues here for lunch after Yelping it and seeing how well-liked it is. I was prepared with very high standards given this fact, and also because the reservation process was very serious business. They only take lunch reservations at 12pm and 2pm, and if you make a reservation at noon you have to promise to be out by 1:30. They also inform you that if you're more than 5 minutes late you will lose your table. Finally, you have to call back to confirm your reservation one day in advance--they won't call you. Per the very strict instructions, we arrived on time and all ordered a chef's selection of sashimi and sushi rolls for the lunch special. At $23 per person, I have to say that while the fish was fresh and delicious (a baseline requirement for sushi) there was absolutely nothing special about it. It was a very average bento box in a calm, quiet, efficiently-run space, but I will not be dreaming about this sushi for months to come. The one real wow-factor for me was being seated to face the sushi bar, where the talented chefs, all dressed in white, prepare the fish with a speed and careful slight of hand that looks like a ballet when you watch them. Sushi is an art, and it was incredible to watch them work. I really just wanted to have my socks knocked off, but they remained firmly on my feet. Better luck next time.

4.5 stars This place is outstanding. The sushi and sashimi here are top notch quality. If you get the pre-fixe meal you can try a little bit of everything and you'll be pleasantly surprised. The chefs make the sushi with a dab of wasabi in between the rice and slice of fish, so if you do not like wasabi remember to tell your waiter. It seems as though this is more of a traditional style restaurant because you won't find a lot of the crazy fusion rolls on the menu which are typically more of a western thing. The service is excellent and the atmosphere is a little on the quiet upscale side. I was here on a Saturday and it was reservation only so don't try to come here on a whim. It seems like they have perfected their timing with reservations and turning tables as there is no waiting area and I noticed that people arrived on time as diners were leaving the restaurant. I will definitely return and try the Omakase next time.

I love sushi. ?By that I mean I love quality sushi. ?Therefore, I love Sushi Yasuda. It's expensive. ?You don't get that much per piece. ?But Dear God, my life has been changed. ?I've always enjoyed uni, but until Yasuda, I've never LOVED uni. ?Same with the many types of eel and salmon I tried that I didn't even know existed. ?There are white salmon out there? To be brief, my experience here was the best and worst thing to happen to me. ?Unless you're on of the fortunate people who can afford to eat this regularly, Yasuda remains an educational experience teaching what sushi SHOULD taste like. ?But when the lesson's over, it's back to the same tired fish that the rest of the world eats...or poverty.

Yasuda is hands-down my favorite sushi place in the U.S. ?At least from all the places I've tried over the years. If you can, try to get reservations at the bar where you can watch the chefs work their magic. ?In general, I just ask the chef what's best that evening and order piece by piece until I am stuffed. ?The oyster nigiri here is something else! ?A fresh oyster on rice with a few dabs of sea salt. ?Pure perfection. Maki lovers will not like this place because you come here for fresh, great quality fish thats from the ocean. They do not give you soy sauce and wasabi - you are to eat the nigiri as prepared by your chef. ?Some pieces will get a few touch of sauce; others a few dabs of salt. ?There is so much joy from eating here. One time my friend asked if the uni was imported from Japan and to much surprised, the chef said: "Santa Barbara!" ?He went on to say that the best uni in the world comes from Santa Barbara. ?Really?! ?Who knew. Top notch quality sushi. ?Go and you won't be disappointed. ?This place does get expensive but very much worth it if you love great quality fish!

We're all familiar with Master Chef Yasuda's pedigree. From his roots in Japan, to his time in Flushing, his tenure at Hatsuhana and the culminating celebrity status in NYC, his story is pretty well documented. However, now that he is back in Japan, I had been curious to see if there has been any drop-off in quality since his departure. I lucked out with a last minute 8:15 reservation at the sushi bar. That's one of the the advantages of rolling solo. I was told I was penciled in until 9:15. I had one hour to eat since the place is always packed and busy. Anyway, I wanted to go Omakase but since I had already dropped $50 bones on lunch earlier in the day, I thought I should be economically responsible. So I settled for the Matsu course (12 pieces + 1/2 roll) $36. It's a really good value for the quality you get. I got the tuna, salmon, fluke, rainbow trout, spanish mackerel, scallop, bonito, tilefish, kampachi, striped bass, ikura (salmon roe) and unagi, served piece by piece. Tacked on a piece of anago (black seawater eel) and sawani (white seawater eel) since Yasuda-san used to be an Eel chef and they know what they are doing here. They had 6 different kinds of fresh/salt water eels. The unagi included in the matsu and the extra anago and sawani were delicious. Each with their own unique texture and flavor. The sawani came with a squirt of lemon instead of the typical eel sauce. It was delicious. I had a 1/2 roll of king salmon and it was crazy good. I ate it without any soy sauce. The only downer was the fact they didn't have any uni in stock tonight. But I'm giving them a pass since everything I ate today was amazing. 14 pieces + 1/2 roll = $50 Overall, if there has been any decline, it's barely noticeable and the sushi here is still sublime. The different textures and flavors of the fish are maintained meticulously and the cuts are prime grade. The sushi rice is prepared perfectly. It's molded perfectly. Yasuda certainly does not lack precise execution. It's the minute things that separate the great and good sushiyas and they seem to understand this well. With or without Chef Yasuda, this Sushiya keeps churning out delicious sushi under the direction of the new head Chef Tamura. And they have been doing it since 1999. They're still among the best that Manhattan has to offer. SP3: $6+ if you go Omakase SP3: $3 if get the Matsu course. Great value

Overall: ?Clean flavors, fresh fish, light lunch, minimalist decor, reasonable lunch prices. Details: Started with prawns, edamame and mountain veggies. ?Prawns were awesome (shout out to the waitress who noted that 3 came in the order and we had 4 people, so she threw in an extra - that's some service right there). ?Edamame was good, but it's good everywhere IMO. ?Mountain veggies were a bit weird, not my thing, but good - tiny portion though. Toro and Rock Crab with Avocado for main. ?Rolls were FANTASTIC! ?Melt in your mouth good. ?Did not need soy or wasabi. ?Loved. Ended with moshi ice cream in red bean and green tea flavors. ?Did not care for the green tea, too much tea flavor for me, but the red bean was really good. ?Tiny portion though. ?Co-worker got the fruit plate for dessert and it was beautifully presented kiwi, pineapple and mango. ?It was so pretty and the fruit looked perfect.

Hello melt in your mouth sashimi. I am a hard-core fan of sashimi and this place was pretty amazing. Went during lunch and ordered omakase sushi and sashimi mix. As an appetizer, flash fried shrimp with green tea. Now, this was the "meh" part of the meal. They were just ok. Nothing special and I've had much better. Creative though. As for the sashimi, you receive 3 types and 3 slices each. For the sushi, you get a roll and 4 pieces of nigiri. The chef's choices were butterfish, scallop, shrimp and eel (and all were AMAZING, especially the scallop and eel). I am really glad to have done omakase. Yes I was full after this meal, but despite the full stomach (amazingly enough), I still wanted more. I love fresh sashimi!!!

Sushi at Yasuda is very austere and simple. ?No fancy rolls, no creative uses of doritos chips... .just excellent fish and rice. ?Come here if you like Uni, because theirs is amazing. ?The toro will melt in your mouth. ?And the mochi ice cream at the end is perfection.

I go here for the Tuna. When in New York. When I can get a table. When I feel like a meal in Midtown. They have a delectable fish broth soup that sets the tongue in the right direction before takeoff and great to have when trying to get that sensation that fills your head when you've been on a cross country airplane flight. The sushi was slender and sublime to the taste. Tuna. Butterfish. Salmon. All of them from an exquisite cut. Rice: Fluffy, bountiful. Ahh...rich. The saki wasn't the best, but I mean saki is saki. I don't really expect that much. If you want the real, raw in a good way, deal this is the place. The environment is midtown pleasant. Nothing too much, nothing too little, you know: biz amoral. That's ok the sushi bar is made of out some killer bamboo. Well done. I wouldn't call it the best sushi ever. I'm still holding out. I can't explain. It's a sensation. I know it's out there.

The prix fixe options are absolutely a steal for what you're getting in quality, service and taste. It's always packed here for good reason and that makes the freshness factor essentially straight from the ocean to your chopsticks (or hand if you dive into the sushi the traditional way). Personal favorites: arctic char, salmon, jack mackerel, Tasmanian trout, orange clam... The only way this restaurant could be better is if it moved into the lobby of my building. A rave review for our waitress who didn't mind our attempts to chat in Japanese. Arigato gozaimasu!

First of, I can't thank the other reviewers enough for the positive and informative reviews. I come through Manhattan for work, and often do not give a lot of thought to 'where's dinner going to be.' Yasuda was an absolutely amazing sushi experience. Before this meal, the best sushi I had was in Maui and at Heat, in Chicago. Not only does Yasuda rank high on the list for quality of the food, but the service was first rate. I was dining at the bar and had an amazing chef who not only was a master with his culinary skills, but made me laugh for the entire time I was there.

I rave about this place. All the time. Even when I'm stuck out on the West Coast. Actually, if any of my friends are going to visit NYC, they always ask me what the sushi place is that I won't shut up about. And then they come back and they won't stop talking about it. Crap. I better stop talking about it if I don't want the secret to let out. This place is amazing. And you know it's good when it doesn't need its name splashed all around outside. This definitely isn't your 2-for-the-price of 1 or California roll joint. This is quality fish. Fresh and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I have challenged a number of New Yorkers to find fresher sushi around. It's hard for them to try. The menu is deceptively simple. But like the decor, Sushi Yasuda is all about the no-frills approach. Don't try to hide subpar fish under a dollop of mayonnaise. Instead, the food's clean, fresh, and oh so delectable. Definitely splurge for the sashimi cuts of toro. Sure they may cost $7 per piece or more. But your mouth will be thanking you. Oh, and their negihama roll is amazing. Who knew that yellowtail and scallion could be so buttery? Even their cooked dishes are to die for. Their spider crab appetizer was seasoned to perfection, and their fillets of sea bass were cooked just right. My mom and I ordered two plates of that. Sure, their prices aren't cheap. But do you really want cheap sushi? Fish that may be a day or two old? No thanks. My mom and I consistently spend $100+ for dinner b/w the two of us. But even though I'm little, I can eat. Especially when it comes to sushi. But for those who are a little less willing to dole out the cash, they have good prix-fixe meals for lunch and dinner. I think it was 3 rolls + miso soup for $20. Not bad at all. Whenever I'm back in New York, this is the place to hit up.

The best sushi that ever crossed my lips! Sit at the sushi bar and watch 6 sushi chefs crank out loving, artisanal food art. Small balls of elegantly, steamed rice, fresh sashimi that transports you back to a Pacific fishing village. I loved their take of oysters with a underside of salt and lemon and the various kinds of eel, salmon and mackerel. ?You don't need to use soy sauce to dress your sushi because it is already perfect. Although my sushi chef didn't speak that much, this is a good place to practice your Japanese. It's easy to get caught up in the moment ordering everything you see, just remember it's $5 a pop.

I've long heard that Yasuda is the place that any true lover of sushi has to visit, I've been looking forward to checking it out.

Verdict? ?This is the real deal. ?Outstanding sushi. ?No frills, tricks, or gimmicks just perfect fish over perfect rice. ?We ordered omakase and the chefs selections were all outstanding. ?They included two rolls which surprised me, because I had long ago abandoned rolls in favor of pieces of sushi, but Im so glad they did because they restored my faith that an occassional roll can be a wonderful addition. ?And its SO much fun to share all the tastes of omakase with friends. ?A visit to Yasuda is without a doubt, a great place to celebrate a special occasion.

The variety of fish is only part of the attraction at this fine establishment. Service is impeccable to a fault (literally) - fresh hot towels, quicker than a blink-of-the-eye style of service and the waitress comes and wipes the table with the tip of a washcloth every time you might dare leave a drop or so of soy sauce on the sushi bar table. ?The last part was definitely overkill (I wanted to call the waitress "mommy" and also have her wipe away any other transgression of etiquette I might have committed), but other than that we thoroughly enjoyed the experience and skill of the sushi chefs. Some examples of the different types of fish that were available on the day were: - Skip Jack (tuna) - Fluke (yum) - Striped Bass - Porgy - Ainame - King Salmon - White King Salmon - Sockeye Salmon (another recommendation) - Sanma - Spanish Mackerel - Pompano - Butter Fish I thoroughly enjoyed the "kuchiko" (sea scallop guts!) and the shirayaki (white freshwater eel) was just a complete melt-in-your-mouth experience. The soft shell crab appetizer was amazing because I have never seen a soft shell crab with so much meat (I'm unfortunately more familiar with those fried up tiny wizened ones). If it is more to your taste, traditional sushi is also available, except I somehow doubt they do California rolls...:)

***Just wanted to add that last night I had the Blue Fin Toro from Spain and it literally brought a tear to my eye*** Nothing short of amazing. ?Go for the omakase, because getting a GD cucumber roll, like the woman sitting next to me, is ridiculous. ?While you're waiting try the soft shell crab - the meatiest most beautiful one I have ever had. ?And the fried blowfish - which was light and fresh which is not usually the way I describe fried foods. ?The fish is super fresh and I love that the pieces are reasonably sized. ?I'm not a fan of the Costco size sashimi that places like Yama serve. ?I'm thinking that if I can fit my fist in my mouth, but I can't get a whole piece of Yama's hamachi in there, the pieces might be a bit large. ? I love the toothpicks they give you at the end - they look like they've been whittled by Yasuda-san himself. ?Wonderful.

Went there for lunch this week. Absolutely perfect experience: - Food: great Hamachi, Roe, Unagi. Nice touch of sprinkling the sashimi with just the right amount of soy sauce. - Service: speedy and attentive without being rushed. Nice touch with the warm towels and dessert tea - Atmosphere: clean, simplistic, beautiful. beautiful people as well. Haven't tried the highly touted Sushi of Gari yet, but this is the best sushi I've ever had.

I was expecting to be blown away by the sushi here because everyone I know loves this place. I think the presentation is really nice, but after spending a lot of money, I left hungry and not satisfied. I also don't like the atmosphere. It's very minimalist and cold. It feels like a place for a business lunch rather than any sort of dinner with friends. Don't get me wrong - the fish is indeed very fresh and good, but I just don't think it's worth it.

This might just be the freshest sushi I've ever had! ?The decor of the restaurant was bright, clean and simple (which appropriately matched the type of cuisine). ?My friend and I started out with the green tea powder dusted shrimp which was delicious. ?I then selected one of the prix-fixe sushi & sashimi combinations which I thought came with a decent amount of food for about $20. ?My friend went for the omikase. ?We finished our meal with red bean and green tea mochi ice cream (how could we resist?) which was small, but yummy. I thought that the service here was quite lovely--which was surprising, given that when I called to make reservations the host informed me that (a) I couldn't be late or else they would give my table away and (b) we only had the table for an hour and a half (i.e. no loitering allowed after our meal). ?While we did escape within our alloted time, I didn't get the impression that we were being rushed out of the restaurant at all. ?Overall, I really enjoyed this dining experience (although I was a little surprised by the tab). ?The sushi was definitely fresh--but it'll probably never be my all time favorite sushi place because the menu was so traditional and simplistic.

UNPARALLELED. ?Let me repeat that. ?UNPARALLELED. During my brief stint in Japan I ate the greatest sushi in existence. ?Over the years I have sampled the finest and freshest cuts fish available around the world (for example I once had minutes-ago-caught blue fin sashimi on a fishing boat). ?My palate and discerning taste for fish has only increased over the years. Generally speaking, I have "dumbed down" my standards for fish quality of late, as I simply never find myself impressed by or surprised by anything that most sushi restaurants offer. Then, there was Sushi Yasuda. I sat at the sushi bar, and Master Itamae (sushi chef) and eponymous owner Naomichi Yasuda served me himself. As with any great sushi establishment, I offer no preferences, no limits and no orders when I sit at the bar. ?I simply say, "Please prepare for me whatever you wish." What followed was an symphony of flavors conducted by a master. ?His enthusiastic, confident and passionate demeanor only served to enhance the experience. ?He seasons the sushi with his own shoyu blend, which I did not dare alter by adding any on my own. I sat at the bar for around an hour, blown away, piece after piece. ? At some point during my meal, I asked Yasuda-San about other Japanese restaurants, and here came his mindset. ?He recounted to me that the tradition of Japanese food has faltered of late, even in Japan, and that dwindling are the number of establishments he would consider "good." I am inclined to agree. ?In a world of Rainbow Rolls and Teriyaki chicken, the true beauty of sushi is becoming a lost art. ? But not here. ?This is not a restaurant for the nightlife crowd, or parties. ?Not one for loud "Kanpai" or sake bombs. ?It is a PURE connoisseur's locale. ?Beautifully understated decor, and wonderful sushi. I left the bar $200 lighter, but more content than any meal has put me in years. ?I would fly to NYC for one night just to eat here again.

Had the pleasure of dining at Sushi Yasuda on my last visit to NYC. I knew I wanted to try out a sushi spot for dinner on one of the nights we were in NYC. So, of course I turn to Yelp for the 411. After reading such great reviews, I ?decided Sushi Yasuda it is. I called about a month in advance and made a reservation for two at the sushi bar. Again, my fellow Yelpers sure did not disappoint, it was an awesome dining experience. When we sat down, the bf and I decided to go for it and try omakase here. We each had about 25 pieces of sushi....wowza! I know that was a lot but we didn't even realized it till we got our bill. Everything was quite tasty and so very fresh! The only thing I realized is that I do not like octopus, squid or clam raw. They have such a ?wierd texture and a funky taste to it. Thanks to this experience, ?I now have learn to let the sushi chefs know I do not want that as part of my omakase. Besides the octopus, squid and clam everything else tasted wonderfully. I really can't remember everything we ate but there definitely was a few items that were absolutely amazing. These included the white king salmon, uni, hamachi, toro, tasmanian trout, and sawani. YUMs, YUMs, YUMs!!! On top of this there hot sakes were super tasty and well priced. Sushi Yasuda is definitely worth a try when in NYC. But you'll definitely have to be ready to shell out some cash. Total cost for dinner for 2 peeps was about 320, definitely not cheap.

I am a sushi snob. Took a gf who is not. We both loved it. I was only in NYC for a few days, and was happy that I was able to make a reservation for the night of. The decor was exactly my cup of tea- simple, clean, warm. The service was excellent, from beginning to end. I like that they watch your cup of tea-- if it's more than 1/2 empty, they bring you a new cup; if it's getting cold, they also bring you a new cup. Wow. We sat at the bar, I got the Sushi Matsu ($36 sushi only) and she got the sushi and sashimi combination ($24.50, soup and dessert included). For the Sushi Matsu, I can pick 12 different nigiris from a list (2 max of the same kind) plus a roll. I chose almost all shellfish and some uni. My fave of the night was the hotate himo. UM UM UMMMM. Delish. The list did not include mirugai... but how is a sushi-lover going to resist her some mirugai in such an establishment? No way. I ordered an extra mirugai to end my nigiri experience there. Eeeeexcellent. I don't care for rolls, so I let my chef picked. It was the white salmon roll. Ok, it was decent, but like I said I don't get excited for rolls... unless it's some darn good premium toro roll. *grin* Gf was gracious enough to share her dessert with me. We picked the green tea ice cream because the waiter explained that it's made in house. Ah.. yummy. Now that's some goooood green tea ice cream. So that was my NYC sushi experience. Thank you, Sushi Yasuda, for such an awesome culinary experience without breaking my bank...

More like 4.5 What hasn't already been said about Sushi Yasuda? ?#24 on Adam Platt's 101 Best Restaurants in NYC. All the debate about the best sushi in Manhattan and I think Sushi Yasuda is a definite contender if you're looking for simple and traditional Japanese in a sleek and open space. ?You can come to dinner dressed casual or business casual, nothing too fancy. ?Yes it is expensive, but amazing sushi at this level comes with a price. ?It's actually not even THAT expensive. ?Minimalist d¨¦cor, friendly service, high quality/unique selection of fresh fish. ?I've been here for dinner when Chef Yasuda was still here and after Chef Yasuda's departure, and everything is still great. ?The sushi speaks for itself, and Yasuda actually has a good variety of hot appetizers as well. ?I am obsessed with the green tea ice cream mochi so don't skip out on dessert; the texture of the mochi is perfect and I always end up getting 2 orders. ?This is a place to come splurge if you can really appreciate the fish.

paying lots of money for average food is one of my least favorite activities. I don't know if im spoiled by cali sushi or it was because we didnt sit at the bar (I do always think thats the only way to get the best at a sushi place) but i was sorely disappointed by this place. The sashimi just didnt stand out, which made the quantity of dough we dropped painful. I'm a sashimi addict, as were my 2 friends that came with me. We were looking forward to this place all week, and we ordered a bunch of seemign ly exciting stuff (white salmon, toro, maguro....) and let the waiter pick a bunch, telling him we were open to whatever was freshest, and most interesting - our usual MO at sushi bars. Everything was just....eh. ?One exception was the Uni - it was creamy. buttery and delicious, probably the best Uni I had. but it didnt balance out all the other disappointments :( oh and they were a real pain about reservations (we had 6 people, and we had to call them to confirm like 3 times) and then it wasn't even crowded! so that was eh too. ?Maybe it would have been better if we sat at the bar, but they only let you make a reservation for up to 4.

First off, for someone that has been to Japan and is also Japanese I must say service here is bad in my experience. ?A real Japanese restaurant will never have this kind of service. Little man syndrome alert! ?There is a little skinny Japanese man that wears a black suit jacket and has the worst attitude ever. ?Looking at the other bad reviews it sounds like I am not the only victim. ?Seriously, he doesn't reason with you tells you you're wrong and that's the end of the story. ?smally guy huuuuge ego. ?Long story short, never coming here again. ?Oh and Yasuda should really keep his dog on a leash.

It's great how varied the selection is and I also love that the chef circles his recommendations for the day on the menu. ?The rest of my dinner companions did omakase while I stuck with picking and choosing as I pleased.

Went on a random weekday and perhaps it's because we didn't feel like going with the omakase... but I was greatly disappointed in this place. ?The appetizers were tasty and unique but the sushi didn't seem that inviting and were the tiny slices I've ever seen. To be fair, Nobu and Morimoto (where i did get the omakase) failed to impress me as well so perhaps my sushi-taste is not the norm.

I've never eaten eel like that in my life. Never knew it could have the fluffy, yet firm consistency that brings to mind the phrase "al dente" (but in the context of sushi). Now I know. The fatty tuna was superb. Probably the best I've had to-date, but I am not a sushi-connoisseur. GO!

To compare Yasuda to any other sushi place is not possible. I have been eating sushi since I 5 years old, but I feel I never truly ate sushi until I went to Yasuda. Sitting at the bamboo sushi bar with your own personal sushi chef you realize you are in for an experince. The fish list is given to you with the chef recommendations circled there are at least 40 types of fish with 4 kinds yellow tail, 7 kinds of eel and variety of other fresh fish! The chef prepares the sushi pieces and are you supposed to eat them as prepared not dipping is soy or adding wasabi. The chef has already handled that! As I devoured King Salmon from NZ, Sea Urchin from Alaska and Maine, Sardines, Oysters and several types of awesome white fish including tile fish. Needless to say I was sushi heaven! After completing my meal at Sushi Yasuda you realize what good sushi is and it hard to imagine going back to the local sushi joints with thawed out tuna and factory made fish!

I thought with a almost 5 * review on yelp given by more than 500 yelpers, this one would be a sure fire winner on my list!!!!! But hell no! dont waste your money and time on this place. I admit the sushi was really fresh and tasty, but I have tasted much better sushi at much better prices!!!! The ambiance was really nice - I liked the decor and the setting. The service was really bad. The lady was initially kind and nice but decided she wanted to kind of not be very attentive and nice mid-way and ended up getting a 15% tip from regular 20-25% tippers (me and my gf)!!

Best sushi in the city. They were out of the fried eel backbones that I crave and my date dropped some of that language they speak up on them, and sho nuff, a big heaping basket popped out of the kitchen and into my cavernous maw. The fact that I have seen two of the chefs from Nobu eating here, on more than one occasion, seals the deal for me.

What I love most about this city is it's uncanny ability to continue to surprise you. The moment you think you've tasted the best sushi this town has to offer, you wind up shocked and in complete gastronomical awe with something new making love to your taste buds! Tucked away on 43rd street in a pretty inconspicuous location lies Sushi Yasuda, hands down some of the best sushi to ever touch these lips. If you're going to come here, you must do it right and get a reservation at the bar...reminded me of all those small carved out restaurants in Asia where businessmen would go right after work to eat and get sloshed. The whole experience and aesthetic at Sushi Yasuda is fulfilling, from watching the sushi chef craft each morsel of fresh sushi for you, to the decor mimicking the zen-like ambiance in Kyoto.. this place does it right! The sushi was flavorful and probably some of the freshest fish I've eaten in my entire life. Each piece was crafted to perfection, with the rice being at room - warm temperature. We went through the entire round of sushi offerings and I fell in love with the Arctic Char, the fresh-water and sea eels, the fatty tuna, the octopus and the scallop (o lord, the scallop). If you're looking for a traditionally inspired sushi experience, Sushi Yasuda is the perfect spot. Even in Mr. Yasuda's absence, this place kills it!!! Don't miss it!!

After wanting to go here for the past three years I was not disappointed. ? I went with a friend on a Tuesday evening and we were sat at the sushi bar and, given a pending reservation for 8 people, we were given a 30 minute window to eat. ?That may sound terrible, and pushy, but we wanted to eat here and were not going to be put off by a little matter such as time. ? Ultimately, with the efficiency and promptness of the service and the fact that the food was barely on our plates for but a few moments, we had time to spare. ? We drank a decent mild sake, had some of the most amazing fresh sashimi and sushi and maki you can imagine, cut / rolled in front of us by Chef Yasuda himself, all accompanied by an amazing soft shell crab appetizer (my first soft shell crab). ?An added surprise was the housemade pickled ginger, fresh grated wasabi root and soy sauce. ?I'm not a big soy sauce user, but after Chef Yasuda assured me of it's freshness and quality I dipped and savoured the delicacy of what they call soy sauce! ?Other sushi joints take note, this is how it's done. ?You shouldn't ruin a perfectly good piece of fish with anything other than this kind of quality. The place was filled with regulars that Chef Yasuda knew, if not by name, by order and business suits. ? I will go here again.

I ordered the chirashi ($28.50) and some uni ($5/piece). I finished it off with green tea mochi ice cream, which was VERY soft and delightful. Every component was put together SO WELL. I love the way the fish was sliced thinly, in rounds almost. The ikura was the best I've ever had. Not salty and slimy, but very fresh and clean. The uni had some sauce on it, and by golly was it the best uni I've ever tasted...sweet and subtle. The rice, of course, was perfect! My date ordered the sushi on the prix fixe menu with a dessert ($24.50). Of all the sushi places I've been to in Manhattan (Yasuda, Aquamarine and Blue Ribbon), this is by far my favorite (yes, I know it's no Masa or Sasabune, but I just moved here so I'll get to those eventually and then we'll see how Yasuda really measures up). They make an experience out of it...from the minimalist decor, to the warm hand towel, the stone chopstick holder, and the bamboo toothpicks. Gorgeous BAMBOO TOOTHPICKS! Contrary to many of the reviews here, I found the service to be very warm, professional and attentive. Though the restaurant closed at 10:15PM, and we had arrived at 9:50, we were not rushed at all. In fact, a little after 11PM, a man in a suit humbly apologized and said that they were closing for the evening. A polite way of being ushered out after a wonderful meal. I promise to return again. I'm in love!

If there is a heaven, I think this is what should be served. Melt in your mouth cuts of the freshest fish you've ever tasted draped over impeccably seasoned rice, highlighted with fresh wasabi, all crafted to comprise the perfect bite. Even the rolls, which I hate to get at a place with such high quality fish, were delicious, wrapped in this amazing nori and encouraged to be eaten sans chopsticks. We sat at the bar and my experience was only highlighted by the way the sushi chef watched anxiously for our reaction as we tasted each succulent morsel and beamed at the praise we showered him with time and time again. Next time I find myself at this sushi haven I will surely bring my wallet and order omakase, but this time I resigned to the prixe fixe. We first received miso soup and 9 thin slices of sashimi each, chef's choice (I got tuna, salmon, and yellow-tail I believe). Then three pieces of sushi (tuna again, my weakness, scallop, and something else, some type of white fish...I can't remember) but all were amazing. Then we each chose one roll to split, I think we ended up with a tuna and a salmon. The nori really made the rolls. So so good. I ended on a piece of uni which I had to try due to the rave reviews I've read. It was every bit as delicious as you all described. I don't know why so many people claim to have been treated rudely. Everyone I encountered was extremely nice and helpful. Sadly, I will never again appreciate the lackluster sushi bars of my hometown again. I must return to NY asap, the rest of the US doesn't know what it's missing. Don't come for the bridge, or the statue of liberty, the billboards of times square, or the bustle of wall street. No. Come for Sushi Yasuda, but only if you know enough about sushi to truly appreciate it.

Things I've learned from this dining experience: 1) Get the arctic char. 2) Unfiltered sake is surprisingly sweet. 3) Don't mix wasabi and soy sauce, lest you be considered a sushi savage. 4) Japanese courtesy cannot be overstated - every sentence and question WILL end with an impossibly polite "Excuse me," as you are left to wonder what exactly they are excusing themselves for. 5) Feeling like a blundering oaf amidst all the delicate dinnerware is to be expected. Worry not, unwieldy friend. Just bask and enjoy all the petite goodness.

How they pulled it off, I don't know, but this is the best sushi I've had outside of Japan. God knows there are about a billion sushi places in the US, and I've only been to about 40 of those, but this place would be hard to beat. You'll only find classic Japanese sushi here. Each piece of fish is treated differently and most do not need to be dipped into soy sauce. One of my favorites was Sea Scallop on which a small drop of lemon juice was squeezed and then topped with a few granules of sea salt. Perfectly balanced. Sushi Yasuda is also remarkable because they've done it on such a large scale. There are five chefs behind the 20-seat counter. You can order directly from the chef and eat slowly, a piece at a time, so you can savor each bite. For the un-initiated, ordering "omakase" will get you the chef's choice of fish. The selection and quality of this place is off the charts. Has to be tasted to be believed.

Yes, I will admit that the host and service doesn't match the level of the food, but the food more than makes up for any minor lack of service! After trying Sushi of Gari (which was EXCELLENT), I wanted to make my Omakaze rounds across the best sushi places in the city. And Yasuda did not disappoint! The magic of this place (which is a fantastic place for sushi-purists) is the simplicity and the quality of the fish. I never knew mackerel or oyster could taste that heavenly (with just a simple "dressing" of sea salt). And the last dish, which was the tuna maki roll, OMG, the BEST in the world (better than the maki roll at Sushi of Gari). The sushi chef mentioned that Yasuda has the highest quality of seaweed in the city and boy was he right (as someone who practically was fed seaweed since birth, or inception I guess since my mom must have eaten seaweed while pregnant with me, it BLEW ME AWAY). Maybe I had a different/one-off experience than those who gave it a lower rating (although I have been there twice) but I would definitely rate this as one of my top two favorite sushi places in the city.

Sushi here = OMG You don't go to Sushi Yasuda for your trendy chic rolls, you come for the fresh tasty sashimi and sushi you cannot get anywhere else! As explained in the menu and website, this restaurant is all about appreciating and honoring the traditions of eating sushi. The service and ordering are efficient but at times odd as they seem to be observing you eat the sushi properly :oP Any pieces you order here are going to be amazing but also great was the black miso cod appetizer we had (though may have been a special of the night kind of thing). Everything from the decor/design of the restaurant to making/confirming your reservation (highly recommended) to the food and service can only be described as high quality and thoughtful. You are guaranteed to have a great sushi experience here!

I consider myself more of a purist when it comes to Japanese - no "funky dunky" rolls (as my bf calls them), and no fusion... ....so I love that this place has amazing variety for sushi/sashimi. I wouldn't say it's the "best" I've ever had - some pieces were straight up misses (esp disappointed with the toro today)... but stick with the chef's recommendations (the ones circled in red each day) - they were all pretty solid. Also would add that the sushi rice here reminded me a bit of the sushi places I used to frequent in Tokyo, i.e., it's done right. I loved that I could taste each grain of rice. I realized when I got the bill that yes, this place IS expensive. My bf and I got 26 pieces, miso soup, green tea, and an yebisu for lunch today and the bill came out to $190 with tip and tax... and honestly, we were still a bit hungry. P.S. Forgot to mention that I LOVE the simplistic decor of the place...

What on earth is all the hype about? This place was absolutely nothing special. The sushi was good but nothing to crave or come back for. Service was awful. Our waitress glared with every extra beer and sake we ordered. And shot daggers when we asked for extra wasabi. One star for the atmosphere. Another for the house sake, which I have to say, is the best I have ever tried.

Hands down the best sushi that I have ever had. ?Fish was incredibly fresh and sushi was perfectly seasoned. ? Tried a variety of salmons, ?tunas and whitefish which were all subtlety amazing. ? By far favorite was sea urchin which had incredibly complex flavors. ?Just don't dip you sushi in soy sauce unless instructed or pickup sushi improperly (chopsticks should be parallel to sushi) otherwise you will be corrected. ?Very "no soup for you"! ?Highly recommend!

Great place to eat if you like delicate, fresh food, hand prepared... good to come with a few friends..However if you are the type of person that hits a restaurant because you are on the brink of starvation...then this place is not for you..It's not the cheapest Sushi bar around and I always leave this place slightly "under" full... that's a good thing you might say...but as an evening spot for dinner its OK.... Actually I prefer Sakagura which is down some intrepid steps on the opposite side of 43rd. It's more of an adventure and a little less clinical.

I'm going to become a regular here. ?Chef Yasuda is a jolly and skilled man as well as the other Chefs there. ?With every bite, you can't help but sit back and mutter OH MY GOD [I'm in Heaven]. ?This is the place to be if you want to convert someone to become a sushi lover. ?Don't be afraid to try anything because you will not get a stomachache - this place is so fresh. They start taking reservations one month ahead so I booked a seat for 3 at the bar with Yasuda. I highly recommend sitting at the bar - it appears the flavor is more robust and the rolls are bigger =] Sushi + Sashimi (4 sashimi that you choose & 3 that Chef chooses, 1 sushi roll & a soup of the day) Combination 4 sashimi chosen from list they provide to you: Fluke, Orange clam, Tile Fish, Freshwater Eel 1 sushi roll chosen from the list they provide to you: arctic char + tazmanian sea trout (The Chef gave us a mix since my party all ordered arctic char initially). ?I loved the flavor in the taz more than the arctic. Chef Yasuda's sashimi pick for us: blue fin tuna (I'm in total love with this), white fish, spanish mackeral Soup of the day (King Salmon) felt like chicken soup for the soul. Special sashimi we requested from Yasuda: Sea urchin (Maine) $5 (note to self: try Alaska urchin next time to prepare for the battle of east vs. west), Pearl Oyster $4

A door with no name?! ?How fufu shishi can you get? The inside was fresh, simple, very clean. ?I felt like I didn't belong. ?Or maybe because I probably wouldnt be able to afford dinner. ?The layout and decor of the place made me feel bored. On to the food. ?HOW. COMPLICATED. CAN. YOU. GET. What the hell? ?So there's this pretty little menu, printed on thin almost translucent paper-- um, ok? ?Cute? I imagined my boyfriend, who's a sushi purist, would enjoy this place being you can only order this or that-- the selection is great, don't get me wrong... but only if you're ordering that specific sushi by itself. If you decide to get a meal, then you have to pick from a certain selection. ?At first glance, I assumed I'd be picking from the menu-- so I was HIGHLY disappointed to discover that I had to pick from a select few that was handed to me on a piece of paper mass printed at the nearest Kinko's. The way you order a combo meal here is really too complicated when you're hungry. ?He hands you a piece of paper and a pen-- you check off what you want. ?That doesn't fit with the whole "feel" of the place. Aside from the crappy way you have to order, the wine was enough to get me tipsy after a few glasses, though was too sweet to go with my sushi. O yes and when I got my sushi, I was shocked at how small the portion was. ?The fish was the diameter of a No. 2 pencil wrapped with ?about half an inch of rice then nori. ?AND the sashimi?! ?LAUGHABLE. ?So small.. they had to order a bowl of rice on the side just to feel somewhat full. ?I tried to help by offering more rice off my sushi rolls but they declined. Thankfully we went somewhere else for desert and that was able to fill us up.

Best sushi I have ever eaten in NYC. I ordered omakase. ?No wasabi was consumed during this meal. ?Sushi chef seasoned each cut of fish with soy sauce, fresh lemon juice, and/or sea salt at his discretion. ?He also pointed out where each cut came from - some from Japan and even one (rock crab) from NJ! I agree with other reviewers that their o-toro is not nearly as fatty as other establishments, but their aburi-yaki o-toro (o-toro seared briefly over a high open flame) was absolutely heavenly. It was quite an experience to simply eat the fish as it's prepared for you. ?No complementary ingredients that top off your rolls like cream cheese, peanut sauce, mayo, or fruit. ?Just the fish. Of course, none of this would have been possible without my wife. ?I'm very thankful she took me here to celebrate my birthday last week. ?We sat at the sushi bar and we were served a sufficient amount of food and drink that we certainly didn't feel like we were being rushed out once our 90 minutes were up. Now... if we can only find a teppanyaki place in NYC that doesn't rely on knife tossing and onion volcanoes as an "appetizer" to our meal.

Went here for lunch today - second time. ?I called and they offered only two seating times - I had to call the morning of to confirm and my table would be given away if I didn't show up w/in 10 minutes of my reservation. ?Sat at a table the first time and spent over $90. ?This time, sat in front of a sushi bar and spent much less (ordered prix-fixe instead). ?Sushi bar is definitely the way to go - love the pacing of sushi and the fact that one chef is designated to serve you and your guest. Not sure if this is the best sushi I've ever had - don't get me wrong, the sushi is good, but is it the greatest? ?No. I thought the medium fatty toro was much better than the bluefin tuna. ?I tried both sashimi and sushi and I find the sushi to be more wholesome. ? Will I go back again? ?Probably not since there are many good sushi restaurants out there that I haven't tried yet.

The BEST, most authentic sushi experience in NYC. I have never been disappointed at Sushi Yasuda. The fish ranks among the top in terms of freshness and taste. The service (at least at the sushi bar) is comparable to any of the top restaurants of Manhattan. Little details from the seaweed (delicious!) they exclusively import from Japan to the bamboo tooth picks on the table, make Sushi Yasuda a clear stand out among top sushi restaurants anywhere. Period. ? For anyone wanting to try Yasuda make sure that you CALL AHEAD to sit at the sushi bar. I also HIGHLY recommend asking to sit with Yasuda. I've sat in the regular dining areas and even with other chefs at the bar - but sitting with Yasuda right there in front of you really takes the experience to the next level. I like to order the sushi & sashimi prix fixe dinner. It'll come with a soup, salad, and dessert. This also gives you nice mix of sushi and sashimi to get you going. If you're like me (fat ass), you'll probably want to try more items after you're done (keep in mind that they limit the selection of fish with the prix fixe dinners). Just talk to Yasuda and he'll offer some great suggestions. I have tried fish at Yasuda that I had hated at other restaurants, and I don't know what the hell because it'll taste awesome (Spanish mackerel). I highly recommend Tasmanian trout hand rolls. Also make sure to have Yasuda make you some eel sushi/hand rolls.

At Yasuda, the fish was fresh (which is the most important thing to me), the service attentive and the space clean; however i prefer bigger cuts of fish when i eat sashimi. So this was not a 5 star in my book, i've definitely had better for the price on the west coast. However, maybe all sushi places are like this in NYC. ?I don't have much to compare it to.

I waited a long time to write this review. Why? Becuase, I felt I truly had to sample sushi from around NYC and around the country to gauge if this is in fact the best sushi you can get on the east coast. I had the omakase at Ushiwakamaru last year and although the fish was top quality, it felt... unexciting. The omakase at Yasuda, by comparison, is just out of this world. Although Naomichi yasuda has left for Japan now, I dined at Yasuda just before he left. Let me put it this way: of all the meals I've had in NYC that I've thought were spectacular... they seemed lame in comparison to the delicious rolls I experienced that night. I mean, it was good enough to merit expletive-laden compliments. It's really quite expensive, but then again it IS the best sushi bar in NYC. You will not regret your choice.

Fan, Yes. Devotee, Nope. I'm from the 'burbs. ?The 'burbs when quality is quality even at a chain restaurant (Taipei, Tokyo Cafe). ?The cuts are better, the air is better, the life is softer. ?And frankly, although the lack of diversity is huge in comparison to the city it does have better food. However, like the city good places to find a good place, you need to know where to look (Sushi Sono - Columbia, MD = Not a Chain) So Sushi Yasuda was a place that I had been walking by on my way to work. ?Every time that I walked by I saw that fish skeleton and thought to myself "hmm...thats cute, would like to go check that out" ? Then, I finally had a chance to go. ?Walked in to two Japanese gangster looking guys. ?Very formal, very Japanese. ?Told us there would be a 5-10 minute wait, this is Friday at about 1 PM. ?They stayed true to their word. ?Called us, sat us down. The decor was nice. ?Very minimal. ?Light wood everywhere. ?Simple and uncluttered. ?Nice. However, they gave us three menus. ?And I must admit I am not the most cultured guy out there so I was kind of lost. ?I'm used to the simple. ?Now given too many choices I get lost. ?I mean...I go to Sushi Time a lot and with that its just "Bento Box" or some americanized name for some sushi. ?This was the real deal. ?Just lists of different fish. ? They brought on some hot towels for us. And it was on. More Pluses: There was a little chop stick stone to rest your chopsticks on. ?Yay! There were instructions on how to: a. Use the Hot Towel b. How to eat your sushi (DO NOT mix soy sauce and wasabi! use a bit of wasabi and lightly dip your soy sauce) I had a bunch of sushi, I don't think I've had before including Scorpion. ?Yep SCORPION. Minus: Goddamn expensive. ?60+ for two people. ? 5 pieces of sushi, 12 rolls each. 1 diet coke. BUT they gave us two teas. ?Which was a good way to end off the meal. Got some money? ?Want some quality, in the city sushi? ?Sushi Yasuda it.

The best, freshest sushi you can get. I was spoiled here by my date as he reserved a special seating with the owner chef himself. A very funny, pleasant man who takes his sushi very seriously!! (tells you to eat it with your hands and must have with a bit of rice). Blown away by all the pieces we were sampled. For a true treat, reserve a seating with Mr. Yasuda. You won't be dissapointed.

I love this place. It truly is the best sushi you can get in NYC. Make sure to eat at the bar! It's only worth it if you do; you have your own personal "sushi chef" who can make whatever you want. You have a choice of just picking from the menu, or allow the chef to prepare you a pre-fixe selection of the best stuff. I recommend the latter. The fish is incredibly fresh and delicious. The portions, however, are tiny. You can only order the sushi a la carte, which can make your meal expensive really fast. I don't come here as often as I'd like because of their ridiculous prices, but when I do, it's an awesome, lavish feast! :)

I took my sister to this restaurant for her birthday on a saturday night at 8 pm and was immediately seated at the bar. ?Let me just say WOW WOW WOW. ?I've had some great sushi living in Seattle, but this was one of the best I've had. ?Every morsel of sashimi/sushi melted in our mouths...and I heard this echoed among some of the other patrons. My sister is a roll only type of person and when we found out this place DIDN"T HAVE ANY (Dragon, Spider, Philly, ?Rainbow rolls etc.) she was a little bit disappointed, but by the end of the sushi and sashimi dinner, this restaurant converted a "california roll only" type into a sushi and sashimi fan. ? The staff were all japanese and extremely attentive, replacing dirty plates and pouring our beers at just the right time. We got hot towels in the beginning of the meal as well as the end. The decor was all bamboo wood interior...very minimalistic and elegant. The quality of the fish is really the star at this restaurant. Besides the sushi, the best surpise of the night were the prices.....I was expecting manhattan expensive sushi given it's location and was pleasantly suprised at how reasonable it was. I had the prix fixed sushi and sashima dinner (4 sashimi and 4 sushi/1 roll) for $20 which came w/ soup or salad. ?She ordered about 4-5 different rolls and both had saporro's all for $60. We both left full and throughly impressed at the quality and the service. ? Definately a place to come again and again.

This has to be the best sushi I ever had......everything was so fresh, from the ginger to the fish. ?We sat at the sushi bar and our chef (can't remember his name, too much sake) asked us what we liked and what kind of fish we were open to. ?I'm not a big salmon person, or sashimi person but everything he gave us was incredibly delicious! ?We started off with yellow tail from New Zealand, tuna from Spain and salmon from Japan. ?Everything just melted in our mouths. ?We also had octopus, oysters, sea urchin, 2 types of trout, ?2 types of eel (have you ever heard of white eel?!) , and a few more tasty pieces. ?Oh, we also got a large bill, but it was totally worth it! ?I can't wait to go back next month and indulge! ?

If I had two words to describe this place, it would be "mercury poisoning". But if I had four, I would add: "...but worth it"! Sushi Yasuda is no frills sushi; ?the entire restaurant looks like its been carved out of a single bamboo trunk. But unlike its surroundings, the sushi is anything but simple. In each bite, the food's delicate elegance stands in stark contrast to the steady fury of knives behind the counter. The end result is the most intimidating -- but delicious -- authentic sushi you can imagine. The entire time I was worried I would commit a sushi faux pas (perhaps poor chopsticks form?), shame myself, and have to commit seppuku everywhere. ...and if I could have had more sea urchin rolls, I would have considered it.

Only once in a blue moon does a meal come along that is of this caliber! The last time I can remember having a meal that could rival this was my first visit to Tsukushi over half a year ago. This place rounds out the perfect Japanese food trifecta in NYC: Tsukushi, Sushi Yasuda, Kyo-Ya. Everything else pales in comparison (honorable mention for Soba Koh). Pretty much everything here is as perfect as it gets. The fresh water eel (shirayaki) is probably the best bite of food I've ever had. The O-toro is in a whole different class than any I've had before. One of the mackerel pieces I had was particularly noteworthy as well, as it was almost buttery and just fell apart in my mouth. Not firm and slightly chewy like most mackerel I've had before. For a particularly unique experience try the Alaskan White King Salmon. Everything here is done with exacting standards. The temperature of each fish is tightly controlled (a key to proper toro is to serve it colder I learned). The sushi rice is kept at the perfect (slightly warm) temperature. Speaking of the sushi rice. It's traditional sushi done to a T, so the nigiri is made with the fact in mind that the rice is the heart of sushi. It's all about the rice...the fish is the accompaniment. This made me happier than you can imagine. Master Chef Yasuda takes a lot of pride in his work, and rightfully so. He makes perfect recommendations based on your tastes, what you've already had, etc. Just sit back, pick a few things, and take his recommendations from there. Water Refill Meter: 5/5 Both water and tea were instantly refilled when you have 1/2-1/4 left. Effectively bottomless.

Fish was fresh, but the portions are so tiny. My friend loved his sea urchin, toro was very good as well. We just couldn't get over how small everything is.

Not since my sushi breakfast at Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo have I had sushi this good. ?If you like your sushi rolls deep fried, slathered with cream cheese, assaulted with jalapeno peppers and topped with panko "crunch" then this probably isn't the place you want to spend your hard earned money. ?But if you're looking for a traditional sushi experience on par with the better places in Tokyo then look no further. The sushi here is authentic, austere and incredibly delicious. ?Words cannot explain the shock to your tasters. ?I'm glad I don't live in NYC or else I'm not sure how I would afford the $200 sushi dinner every Friday night. We started out by ordering the fried soft shell crab. ?Amazing! ?I just had fried soft shell at the Girl and the Goat in Chicago the week prior and heavens to betsy I wouldn't know it was the same food. Yasuda serves the most perfect fried soft shell ever! ?So deliciously rich and crunchy yet clean and light at the same time. ?A perfect starter really. ?We also ordered the cucumber app was well which was OK but really just a compliment to the crab. We sat at the bar, I got the Sushi Matsu ($36 per person for 12 pieces a piece) and ordered them chef's choice. So incredible and sitting at the bar is a must! ?The sushi chef was incredibly skilled at choosing the right nigiri one after another for complimentary taste and texture changes. And put away your soy sauce and wasabi- these guys know what they are doing, already perfecting the sushi with their magic hands and and sauce brushes. ?Adding any more would be like using A-1 and ordering a quality aged steak well done. ?But I digress. The mackerel was incredibly clean tasting, seriously better than any of the mackerel sushi I've ever been served in Japan, including at Tsukiji fish market!! ?We were having so much fun we asked for one more piece after our 12 was over, he served us an oyster nigiri that was out of this world. ?Seriously amazing, order it!! A possible con is that they do serve the rolls pretty quickly, so it's not really a place for a long leisurely meal. But they never rushed us. We took our time ordering and the apps plus additional rolls prolonged the meal- but it still clocked in at just over an hour. ?Best sushi hour ever! ?Go now, it may be pricey but it's way cheaper than that flight to Tokyo.

My first Sushi Yasuda experience was great! early birthday present from my former roomie and her baby's daddy~ I want to preface this by saying that I like my sashimi *super* fresh, or I won't eat it. ?And I am sad to say that I've only come across two Japanese restaurants that serve fresh and tasty sashimi at a more reasonable price, this being one of them. My personal favorite, sea urchin from Maine... ?mmmmm.... ?so fantastically savory that I just can't get enough of~ Mr. Yasuda himself talked with us about the distinctions between the different grades of sea urchin and how sea urchin is protected from other predators in the sea, but that no one (human) is allowed to feed the sea urchin. ?He also said that he likes to 'age' the fish... ?for instance 4 days for the sea bass. ?(for more taste I suppose) who knew? I love Sushi Yasuda for a savory lunch time meal~

It all happened on Saturday night. It was raining/snowing cats & dogs. We had been antsy to try the renowned Sushi Yasuda. We arrived 10 minutes early as the man taking the reservation was extremely clear about being on time. "We won't save your reservation!". We walked in a completely empty restaurant... Which allowed me to enjoy the all wood decor. The waitress brought is some warm towels for our hands. Let's get the waitress out of the way right now so we can focus on the food. She was extremely attentive, to the point that it was almost too much. She was also very discreet and talking so softly that I could barely hear her while she was right next to me. But I believe these are cultural traits and she did a beautiful job juggling with our insane orders. I ordered their $36 12 piece sushi & half a roll which is, all things considered not that expensive for sushi. The pieces were nice and wide, sitting on an appropriate amount of rice and the fish... Oh the fish... Hmmmm the fiiiish! It literally melted in my mouth with delicate and genuine flavors. We rinsed our palates with some sake from Hiroshima between bites. My favorite piece was the eel sushi. It was so much better than the roll. We finished our meal with some moshi ice cream that was as good as I expected, especially the red bean one. I will definitely go back and ask to sit by the chefs next time.

WOW. I've never understood drug addictions until now. After the first bite, I'm hooked and only thinking about when I can get my next hit. I think I'd be ok living in a box if I could eat here everyday. I've worked at sushi restaurants and I thought I've had good sushi. Wrong. I may as well not even consider anything I've had before sushi. I came here for dinner last night and with the help of the waitress (or sushi goddess): -hiramasa- good, but least favorite compared to everything else -orato- Melt in your mouth -bensaba- I get worried that mackeral can sometimes have a too fishy taste, not the case. The texture was great too. -king salmon- white salmon? why have i never had this before?? i HIGHLY recommend this. -sea urchin from Maine- I always avoided this before, but won't anymore. Texture was not gritty at all, just delicious! -freshwater eel- had a bone in it, but it was so good! -toro roll- I know. sin, but I needed something filling. ?Came out ice cold. It wasn't bad but I really can't enjoy toro when it's wrapped in seaweed and rice. I also took pieces of the bf's tuna, salmon roll and anago roll. I thought I wasn't a salmon or anago fan before, these made me believers. I walked out of here feelings as ecstatic and satisfied as a 16-year-old boy that just lost his virginity. And I can't help telling everyone about it too.

Hands down the best and closest to authentic sushi I've had yet in NYC. Don't go cheap and get their set items, which are chock full of cheaper fish. Definitely go a-la-carte, even though you can easily spend about $100 per person. I like the fact that they have fish that's harder to find on the menu at other sushi restaurants. The look of the place is that of a typical higher-end sushi restaurant in Tokyo except for how the managers dress. I think it's funny that they look like they belong to the yakuza or something.

We visited Sushi Yasuda as a group of 5, and were seated at a table sectioned off from the main dining area. Unable to see the other diners, the seating would have been a good gathering environment, except we also lost the view of the sushi chefs. All in all, it felt like we were sitting in a sauna, with the light colored wood surrounding us. ? Ambiance aside ,the sushi/sashimi is as fresh as everyone claims. I can see Sushi Yasuda as 4 or 5 stars if visited solo or with another friend at the counter before the sushi chef.

This was one of the finest eating experiences I've ever had for a dinner, and as such, I still remember it well enough to write a review, months later. Firstly, the staff is incredibly courteous and professional. ?The restaurant, in typical Manhattan style, does not have a ton of floor space, but the interior is designed efficiently and with a pleasing simplicity, and the staff is ever-present, guiding the flow of the restaurant so that it never has that crowded feeling. Sitting at the bar, you can really get the full experience of nigiri expertly shaped with the best ingredients. The flavor and texture of the uni in particular was so exquisite, that it may rank as the best thing I've ever eaten. I'm sure I reiterate every other review when I mention that the fish is of the finest quality, but it is also sliced expertly, for the best imaginable texture and mouth-feel. The rice is seasoned just right, and handled with the proper deftness to maintain good consistency. The nori for rolls is mild of flavor but pleasantly rich, and the texture is so tender that it is chewed without effort, and you think to yourself, "Ah... This is nori." Fresh ground wasabi really rounds out the dining experience. While it will assuredly carve a crater in your wallet, it's really a wonderful place for a special meal that you can anticipate happily and remember fondly.

I would most closely compare the experience here with Sushi of Gari. Not in decor, because it is totally different, but in the pure food experience. I have to say though, I was not blown away and left a bit unsatisfied. The service could've been better, but I'm not giving my rating based on that. I purely judge the food. I mean, It was good. I ordered a sushi / sashimi combo prix fixe and asked the server to just have the chef choose what to serve us. Then I ordered from the chef's recommendations of the day, a la carte (an order of striped bass and king salmon sushi). It was good, but again, not really blown away. Finished with a dessert mochi green tea ice cream which was good but not fantastic. I can't really say that I'm dissatisfied, but I'm not dying to go back. Definitely recommend for sushi purists to try out. The prices are actually fairly reasonable for a place like this.

I've only been here once. ?Can't wait to go again. I was there in November, and had Chef Yasuda do somewhat of a omakase for us. ?I say "somewhat" because we would order something and he would make it - but then also make something else for us to try because he thinks we might like it better. ?For example, we asked for Tuna Cheek. ?He said to us, "Oh, you like the cheek? ?You must try the tail then." ?So he made both pieces for us ?We ordered Hamachi, and he had us try Warasa too to see which we liked better (farm raised vs. wild) - it was my first time having Warasa. ?Texture was a little hard compared to Hamachi. Chef Yasuda was a wonderful chef and teacher. ?He taught us about the sea salt they use. ?From some volcanic island off the coast of Japan called Ogasawara. ?It was interesting... ?He also shared with us his philosophy on old generation vs. new generation sushi chefs. ?What a guy. ?It was a wonderful experience overall!

Yasuda is the beacon on the hill. ?It is the shining example of what Edomae sushi should be. ?In a country that often values quantity over quality, Yasuda is a breath of fresh air from all the Tomoe's and Yama's of NYC, where inappropriately oversized slabs of fish are carelessly thrown atop beds of rice which act as more of a formality than anything. ?It is a saving grace in a city where Sushi Samba or other "trendy" japanese places are too often packed. Sushi restaurants that decorate and season their fish with all sorts of distracting ingredients should all be destroyed (except Gari). ?Okay, so maybe I'm getting a little carried away here... But really, it is a minimlistic haven that stays true to the purest form of sushi and that is a beautiful thing. ?Everything from the sleek and simple decor to the humble plain ti leaf that serves as your plate, Yasuda focuses all your senses onto the excellence of the ingredients and their composition. ?Equally impressive is the attention to detail and quality of service demonstrated by the sushi chefs. ?Noticing that my girlfriend struggled ever so slightly to chew each piece of sushi whole, the chef began making her pieces smaller. ?The expertise and care of these chefs is unrivaled. Yasuda is simply the best. (at least until I win the lottery and can afford to go to Masa). P.S. - Yes, I know I'm a sushi dork.

Yasuda, for now is my second favorite for sushi, ?Taro in Brooklyn and Makoto in Washington D.C. being tied for first. ?I say this lightly though because when I had lunch at Yasuda there were a few pieces of fish that I found just a little below standard of my beloved Taro, the few pieces being staples of any sushi place like toro, hamachi, snapper, umi-shiso roll etc., These weren't inedible pieces by any means just good as opposed to superb. ?Their exotics, however, are a different story. ?Fish such as hirame, black snapper, the four different kinds of sea and freshwater eel, in-house marinated iikura, uni and the like are quite the treats. ?They pretty much melt in your mouth. ?Especially on top of the best sushi rice I've sampled so far. ? I'm not really impressed by the kitchen food. ?I had some sort of fried green tea shrimp and dumplings. ?They're good but your socks still stay on your feet. ?The service is good at the counter but a bit stuffy at the maitre d' station. My guess is that if Yasuda improves on the standard sushi items and worked on their kitchen food a bit that they would be a heavy contender to be King of the Hill. ?Like I say, barring Masa which I haven't been to yet Yasuda does have the best sushi rice and some excellent exotics. Go during lunch but go early like around 12pm. ?Make a reservation beforehand if possible. ?And sit in front of Kiru, one of the sushi chefs, if possible. ?He seems to genuinely enjoy his work and happily tells you the ins and outs of sushi. ?It is a great sushi place and worth the money and any company you meet or bring to the sushi bar.

Ambience is meh and so is service, but this is the best/ freshest sushi I've ever had on either coast. Sit at the bar to get the full experience and let the sushi chef pick for you, trust me he won't steer you wrong. BTW: it's expensive, so be prepared to drop about a hundred bucks per person.

Believe it. If there's better sushi in New York, I don't want to know about it. Very traditional, impeccably prepared and perfectly fresh, Sushi Yasuda is peerless. I had king salmon from New Zealand that was shockingly wonderful. Also noteworthy: sea scallops, salmon roe, sea urchin, toro, and the confusingly delicious fried eel bones. A pleasant surprise here: there's not a minimum omakase price. Since I didn't stuff myself, I made it out of here for under $60 (pre-tip). Very reasonable for some of the better food I've had the pleasure of putting into my mouth. With that said, the prix-fixe menu is shockingly affordable, with a nice set of options in the $20-25 range. Sure, the omakase is better, but is it *enough* better for the cost difference? I think the law of diminishing returns applies here. Next time I'll do prix-fixe. Be sure to make a reservation, at least until they get to know you.

After reading the stellar reviews, I HAD to try this place out on my trip to the Big Apple. ?Being that I've been to Japan and have had real sushi, I was a bit disappointed. ?So let me just lay it out straight, no fuss no muss. PROS: + Sushi is better than most - fish was above average and the rice wasn't squished into a shapeless paste like so many other places do (real sushi aficionados appreciate the rice too!) + Green Tea Tempura Shrimp (I think that's what it was called) was pretty good - the batter made of rice powder was light, crisp, and a little crunchy + Simple decor - the bamboo walls and tables were very clean, the restaurant fairly well lit, and there was actually room between the tables + No trendy-ish music to dupe customers into thinking that it's cooler than it actually is - the food should speak for itself + Quick green tea refills - green tea was decent quality too. + Ginger dressing on the salad was fresh, tangy and tasty. CONS: - Sushi is about 4/5 the size of normal sushi. - The sansai appetizer was tiny and bland. ?I appreciate their use of fresh ingredients, but for $8, I expected at least 1/2 C of sansai veggies. But then again, it was tasteless. - They rush you. ?There is someone at your table every 30 seconds. ?The managers peer INTO your freaking plate every few seconds to see if you're done yet. ?I understand this is New York and they're on a tight schedule but my reservation was from 8 - 9:30. ? Actions speak louder than words and they're saying *Finish up and leave already. * I counted exactly 13 seconds from the moment I placed money on top of my check to when the manager picked it up. Overall, my experience here was okay. ?A $73 meal for two with appetizers ain't too bad. ?If they were a bit more generous with their food and time, I'd add another star. ?As it was, just above average is how I rate it.

I'm not a sushi fiend, but I know great sushi when I taste it. ?Sushi Yasuda hit every nail on the head with their restaurant in Midtown and here's why: 1. ?Decor: ?Elegant and minimalist. ?Simple chairs, place settings and entranceway. ?No big gaudy sign, no flashing lights, no menu plastered on the outside of the restaurant. ?I loved the fish on the outside of the restaurant signaling to the observant passerby that this establishment was associated with fish. ? 2. ?Service: ?They had a coat check, they pulled out my chair, they handed me a hot towel to wipe my hands with. ?They refilled my water glass several times, they also handed me a hot towel after my meal was over. ?Nice touch. 3. ?Sushi: OMG! ?Talk about fresh! ?The white king salmon was amazing, so was the unagi, and every other sushi dish. ?The only disappointment was the shrimp although the sushi chef explained to me that they boiled the shrimp fresh, and then prepared it before giving it out. ? 4. ?Price: ?What do you expect for an amazing dining experience. ?2 people at lunch, about $100. ?Not cheap. ? A must visit on my list of NYC restaurants.

Now that Ushiwakamaru is closed, I've been looking for a new place to go, and Sushi Yasuda is definitely at the top of my list. The sushi was fresh and delicious. We started with the Sushi Matsu ($34) which is twelve pieces of sushi and half a roll, and it was spectacular. God, the unagi is amazing... and they have at least five different types of eel there, not just the usual unagi. Decor is very tasteful, and the wait staff was rather attentive. I ended up spending quite a bit more than I wanted to, but it was really worth it.

This is by far the best sushi in the city. ?The quality of the fish is impeccable, the room is clean and minimal, and the service is always good. ?I think the prices are quite reasonable, particularly for the quality; the lunch pre-fixe is a great deal. ?Plan ahead, because same day reservations are impossible to come by. My only gripe is the obnoxious reservation system, which requires calling and then calling THEM back to confirm the day of the reservation; and every once in a while they claim you never called back to confirm. ?Also, every time I call I am told there are no tables available until 1:30; but every time I arrive early there are plenty of open tables. ?Reservations are limited to 6 people. ?Why all the hassles?

I've been to Sushi Yasuda on two occasions, however close to eight years apart. ?The first time I went to Yasuda, I was a sushi neophyte and I could barely tell the difference between good sushi and what me and my roommates would order from Teriyaki Boy. ? Fast forward several years, and I'm now a bonafide sushi snob and I must say that Sushi Yasuda has some of the freshest, most authentic sushi in New York. ?Everything from the way the service and the way the sushi is prepared and presented is perfect. ?Don't expect to order any Americanized "innovative" takes on sushi like gummy bear tuna rolls, because Yasuda is true to the core, which I can respect. ?We ordered an assortment of tuna, eel, yellowtail, mackerel, ikura, and a few other more ?obscure pieces, and everything was amazing. ? If you're a sushi fan and appreciate the real deal, then make it a point to visit Sushi Yasuda in New York.

This is definitely the best sushi I've had thus far! Came here for dinner with a very good friend. We arrived for our 6:00pm reservations and were seated promptly. The decor is bright and sleek. The staff was extremely courteous and attentive. They bowed every time they serviced our table. Even prior to having our meal, I was impressed with the menu. I love how they explain the 'art' of eating sushi on the left side of the menu. We were also given a menu sheet of the various types of sushi and rolls along with the chef's recommendations circled in red. Needless to say, friend and I went for all the chef's recommendations. We started off with the fried shrimp with green tea powder. We agreed that it must be beads of rice that covered the shrimp prior to being fried. Overall, all the sushi and sashimi we had were top notch. The few that were outstanding in my book were the oyster, giant clam, uni, king salmon and eel (I believe it's spelled--sanwanea). As others have mentioned, the rice is like small tiny beads of pearl--the perfect companion to the exceptional grade of fish. The plating here is simple and straight forward because the quality of the food speaks volumes. It is a bit on the expensive side but well worth the money. A must try for sushi lovers!

*GASP* ?The blond wooden box that is Yasuda makes me want to scream: thanks for killing more pandas- don't worry, there are still about a couple thousand left in the world. I really wanted to turn on my heels and leave- not in protest for the pandas, but because its taste in interior design stunned my family into silence. ?Bare and uptight- it made for a most uncomfortable feeling. ?There was no conversation to be had as everyone was silently chowing down on over-priced RICE. ? I mean, that's the hype, right? ?I'll give credit where it's due- the fish is as fresh as it gets. ?But Ya-Sure-da wanna steal my cash!! ?I still shudder at how much we paid. ?We ordered an insane amount of a la carte, and 4 different rolls(all indistinguishable from the next). ?Great sushi is not meant to be drowned in soy sauce, but there was so much rice that the fish could not fully come through. ?I must have had a bowl's worth of rice that night. And none of us were full. If you've been held captive and you cannot escape, you'll want to sample the deadliest catch; stick with the sashimi & sit at the sushi bar. ?I just hope you got paid that week.

Terrible experience with the host. ?This guys should hire someone with more decency at the entrance and at the reservation time. The host sucks big time, he is unhelpful, uptight and rude. He needs a fashion designer, he still dresses with that 80's baggie pants. ? ?Never ask for a table, eat at the sushi bar, if you eat at a table all the consistency of the sushi will be lost and will not taste the same. The rice gets cold and hard, and it doesn't have the same feeling. ?I wrote the best reviews before for this place, but today they lost two stars. The fish wasn't so tasty, the service was bad. ? Also Mr Yasuda went back to Japan to open a restaurant there, and he left New York, what's happening? ? ? ? ?This place doesn't get that magical word: courtesy. The staff is ?pretentious, snooty.

Let me start this review by saying that I LOVE SUSHI. ?Seriously. ?I would eat it everyday if I could (but...Stallone got mercury poison from too much tuna...so...sporadic trips to Sushi Yasuda will suffice). Sushi Yasuda is a great little restaurant (it's pretty tiny, I think), tucked in Midtown East (close to the UN) and I go there primarily for lunch (I think it's better than dinner). ?I ordered the sushi matsu - 12 pieces from a "matsu menu" and then half a roll. ?There are plenty of options to choose from and if you sit at the sushi bar, you get your food super fast! The chef also put a little soy sauce on all of the individual pieces so you didn't have to - you could just pop the sushi into your mouth! My favorite sushi this time wasn't the tuna, but instead, was the eel. I'm usually a big fan of eel and you really can't go wrong with it (at least I haven't had any really bad eel ever), but this eel was just the right temperature, had the perfect amount of sauce on it, and melted in your mouth. ?The half roll I got at the end of the meal was the highlight - it was a pale orange (or white) colored salmon that almost tasted like it was pureed (that's how smooth it was). ? Sushi Yasuda doesn't do special rolls like a rainbow roll or anything, but if you want some of the freshest sushi in New York, make a reservation at Sushi Yasuda!

First of all, Sushi Yasuda kicks Sushi Seki's ass. . . . Don't sleep. From the design to the service, everything about this joint is authentic and fresh. ?The sushi chefs and staff actually speak to you, and really try to educate you about sushi. ?The price is reasonable for the quality of the fish that you're getting. Although, my one critique is that in the last few times I've been there, they stopped "announcing" people as they came in for their table. ?That used to be my favorite thing. ?Holla, if you remember them doing this, I could have been on some crazy green tea high at the time, but I know that this added to the overall experience. ? To top it off - the bathrooms are hella clean, man. ?It's a sushi place that you can take your new honey dip to, and she'll be impressed that you knew about it - and you won't be that broke afterwards, so you can afford to take the cab home instead of the 6 train. . . .

Yasuda is wonderfully Japanese. It is so simple and essential that any other location in New York would feel cluttered next to it. Sit at the bar. An army of sushi chefs stands at attention. Even though it was Friday, we had one chef serving just the two of us. He coached us through what to order, displaying the cuts of fish if we had any questions, and making recommendations. He also gently guided us if we made little gaffes, like using chopsticks to eat sushi. We ate each piece of sushi as he made it, and it was all divine. I recommend the shrimp--I didn't want to order it at first because it seemed so standard, but our sushi chef talked me into it, and it was insanely good. They cook the shrimp to order, and it's extremely flavorful. After we finished each piece of fish, the sushi chef would ask us if we liked it. When we responded, "wonderful!," he would shyly smile and say, "thank you." heartbreaking!

Prixe Fixe meal of Sushi and Sashimi for $24.50 before tax and tip - fish was definitely delicious and oh so fresh!!! One of the best deals in the city. 9 pieces of sashimi with 6 pieces of sushi. FYI sashimi is chosen by the chef and yesterday night we had the Tuna, Spanish Mackerel and I believe yellowtail (which it was was yummy, I saw my friend's "o" face almost a dozen times throughout the night). The spanish mackerel is definitely my favorite, I had the horse and regular mackerel before and thought I hated mackerel but after the taste of the Spanish Mackerel, Sublime I believe is the only word that can describe my reaction As for the sushi roll, I ordered the Spanish Mackerel because I loved it so much, originally wanted the King Salmon Roll but it was sold out as that fish must have tasted really good like any of their other fishes. Next time I go back I must go and try the King Salmon Roll, had 2 pieces of my friend's White King Salmon Roll as well and it was really fresh and great. I will definitely be spreading the word on this place to the rest of my friends. I didn't try the Uni but the three other guests did and it was so yummy that 2 of them had to get a second order of it. As for the other guest, he really wanted to but since he had already eaten the prixe fixe, a sushi matsui that he split with one of the other guests where he received 6 of the 12 pieces of sushi, and 1 roll, the uni he had last really hit the spot. I know because although he claimed he would purposely stop making his "o" face as I kept pointing it out, he made it again because it was just so natural...his content with that piece of uni showed how fresh and tasty it was. Included in the prixe fixe meal you also get to choose 4 types of sushi, I had the Rainbow Trout, Scallops, and two others I forgot and hey you can't blame me everything was so good and the vast availability of fish they have on the menu is so extensive it would take a freaking genius to remember all they had in one night I also finished off with 2 scoops of ice cream, one red bean and one green tea. I enjoyed both, the red bean was a bit sweeter and you could really taste the beans although you can't see it and the green tea although a little bitter, is perfect, the exact way I like my green tea ice cream. I think if I go back again I will do the two scoops of green tea ice cream. As for the service, the waiter was great - every time the green tea got cold, we were served another cup I had 4 cups of tea throughout the course of the 1 1/2 dinner meal which is superb. The green tea was yummy too, it had the powdery texture which you know it was nice tea and not that cheap green tea you would get elsewhere. The waiter was oh so polite with everything, every time my chair was pulled out for me when I was seated in the beginning, need a restroom break and on my departure. Superb service and superb food definitely deserves four stars from me. My total came out to 31.00 with the tax and tip. Not too shabby for such a wonderful experience. I enjoyed this place a lot better than my experience at Archipelago, but do keep in mind its two different culinary experiences.

Bottom line - know what you're getting into/what you like before you come You like - plain and very fresh sushi, then - come and enjoy! You like - interesting and creative sushi, then - go somewhere else like Sushi of Gari To me, it seems that the key to this restaurant isn't so much the slicing and ingredients, but choosing fresh fish from the markets. ?Note that I didn't get anything else aside from the sushi. ?Instead I had the Sushi Omakase along with additional pieces to try to get closer to full. So yeah, good sushi, but I prefer paying for more interesting creations and although it was good, I likely won't be going back any time soon.

Mmm...not better than Ushiwakamaru, but definitely on the same excellence level. Both highly recommended. Yasuda's interior is fancier. Came here on Friday, party of 4, sat at chefs table. I had 16 pieces of Chef Selection for $100 (included $10 carafe of sake) which was totally worth it. I love coming out of a restaurant and not being phased with how much I spent. (Ushi's bill was cheaper though). The best part of the meal was that our chef gave us a unique comparison tasting. So fatty tuna is fatty tuna, but he gave us one from origin A and the other from origin B. We really enjoyed tasting the difference. Definitely worth traveling uptown for!

I came here on a Saturday night for a 9:30 pm reservation. I ordered the Sushi and Sashimi combination Sushi: yellow tail hamachi with scallions Sashimi: tuna, striped bass and mackeral Toro Fried soft shell crab The food was solid. ?The soft-shell crab was very flavorful and the fry-ness added a great texture to the crab. Toro-fatty tuna...melts in my mouth. yummmm-an orgasmic experience. As for the sashimi, I didn't like the striped bass...I didn't like how the flesh was crunchy, but the tuna was great!

I closed the meal with green tea ice cream. ?The ice cream was a bit too soft, but the flavor was solid- bitter tea taste.

If Sushi Yasuda had a better location and a cooler crowd it would be 5 stars in my book but unfortunately those two variables are detractors for me, as a downtowner. Overwhelmingly boring people and expected, stark, cold Midtown decor aside, what happens behind the sushi bar here is pure deliciousness and totally magic. If we're judging by what is on the plate - then this place is out of this world. The sushi is fresh, adventurous and amazing. I recommend letting the chef choose or choosing all off of the daily specials.

I could only be happier if the place was full of Japanese businessmen and schoolgirls in sailor outfits. The wait staff could have been a little more knowledgeable so I gave them 4 stars.

As Joey Lawrence and Keanu Reeves (Matrix I during the roof top training) say ... "WHOA!" Came here on a reco from a friend and man ... I'm still dreaming about the perfectly homemade soy sauce coated nigiri with fresh wasabi root. ?When a restaurant has fresh wasabi root and not the fake booger stuff you know you're in for a good and expensive meal. ?I don't think I've ever spent more on lunch, but it was well worth it. We sat at the bar and ate with Chef Yasuda ... what a cool guy. ?He was a great host and explained everything to us. ?If you can eat with him you should seriously just let him order for you because he knows what's up. ?After flying on a Virgin red eye our hotel room wasn't ready, but we had reservations at 1:30. ?Imagine 2 scrubby kids in airplane clothes amongst the Gucci and D&G suits of NY. ?The hosts looked a little bug eyed at us, but Yasuda was awesome. Sorry, no pictures. ?Imagine the scrubs not only dressed down, but also taking touristy photos while others are trying to seal that billion dollar deal. ?Haha. 5 stars and I wish we had this in the Bay! ?I want to go back to NY just for this treat.

There are two types of sushi places, traditional and fusion. Yasuda is a traditional sushi restaurant. You will be presented with top quality fish in ways that will bring out the optimal flavor of the fish you are served. The rice is phenomenal! Hands down the best rice I have ever had. It is always perfect, every time I have gone it has been absolutely perfect. Check out the arctic char while it's in season. For those who don't know, it's a tastier cousin of salmon. Yasuda is great for those who know their fish and know what they love. You can experience 4 or 5 different types of yellow tale on some days. Oh and the uni! California uni, is my favorite. It's a bit more orange and sweeter then the east coast stuff. I recommend ?sitting at the sushi bar unless you're with a party of more then 3, and at least once in front of Yasuda himself. He makes sure not only to present the best fish in the best way to experience their flavor, he also presents the sushi in a particular order for your tasting experience to progress in a certain direction. This is for the omekase of course. Reservations required! Don't be late. You will loose your spot.

This place is nothing shy of phenomenal. I go here once every two weeks or so and it is consistently the best sushi available in NYC. ?Even my West Coast sushi snobby friends admit it is some of the best they've ever tasted. ? Fresh fish, flawless service and daily homemade sushi rice are highlights. ?The $27 prix fixe menu is always an amazing way to save. ?Five pieces of sashimi and two roles with soup or salad. Definitely one of the best deals in the city. You MUST sit at the bar to get the full experience.

This how sushi supposed to be served and enjoyed, at least that's what I think. Sushi Yasuda has always been my special occasion destination. I normally make a reservation about a two to three weeks in advance and so far they always had my desired time and always, always ask for the counter seating. I would rather change the date of the reservation than sit at a table. At this restaurant show is at the counter, you have to see how these chefs under the leadership of the Yasuda San create these tasty little morsels of deliciousness. They offer two menus; one is for appetizers, entrees from the kitchen and drinks. The other menu is what you can order that day from the sushi bar. There is also a small menu of daily specials which we always order few appetizers from that to start the meal. Then we simply return the menu back to our server and tell them what we don't like and leave the rest up to the chef. Chef starts preparing the sushi and leaves it on the your large banana leaf. There isn't any chopsticks, wasabi or so sauce unless chef think that you will need them with what he serves. Chef already dresses the fish with enough soy sauce, wasabi, lemon juice, etc depending on the fish so you don't need to add anything else to this perfection. There is a small wet towel so you can wipe your fingers after each time you enjoy your sushi. This how sushi meant to be consumed, held between the thumb and the index finger. They offer a small but excellent selection of sake which is served in small carafes. For some reason they don't serve them in large bottles so if you drink a lot then make sure your server will bring fresh carafes as soon as they see you are running low. Sake is good and very reasonably priced and they are selected to complement the sushi. ?Talking about sushi they always have about forty to fifty types of fish in the Sushi Bar menu. Sometime they ran out of some but then they have other daily specials. According to Chef Yasuda most of the fish comes from Japan's Tsukiji Market via daily flights. Be prepared to be amazed with the taste, quality and the selection of the sushi. Last time they offered three types of Uni (Sea Urchin), five types of eel, seven types of salmon, five types of tuna and more... They also have a point of differentiation from other Japanese sushi restaurants. Chef Yasuda believes sushi is 50% fish and 50% rice so the preparation of the daily rice is a process of its own. It needs to have the correct sweetness, stickiness, moisture, etc. So after doing this for over twenty years Chef Yasuda seems to perfected his trade. You have to try it once to appreciate it. One thing you need to consider is that you only have one hour and thirty to forty-five minutes before you have to vacate your seats. This is the only drawback about the Sushi Yasuda. Because they are extremely popular they have a continuous flow of costumers from the opening to closing so they want to make sure that you are done with your meal within the allowed time which is not too bad when you consider that you are served non-stop with the bite size sushi. Prices are above your average sushi restaurant in New York. At our last visit our check came out to about $280.00 for two people with few carafes of sakes, few appetizers and the chef's selection of sushi. When we left we were pleasantly satisfied without being hungry or full. We continue to keep Sushi Yasuda as our special occasion destination and we look forward to visiting few times a year to enjoy this unique experience in enjoying another aspect of sushi making and eating.

Have you have ever had fresh sashimi? ?Sashimi that's so fresh that the texture is perfect, sashimi that melts in your mouth, sashimi where the fish feel like it was just freshly caught that morning? ?Sushi Yasuda is place to go if that's what you are looking for. It's salmon season right now, so there were 9 types of salmon. ?Is that even possible? ?There are fish that are only in season for 2 weeks at a time, so that they aren't over-fished. ?I tried salmon from the Copper River? I also had fluke, Tazmanian trout, blue fin fatty tuna, hamachi, Spanish mackerel. ? Highly recommend making a reservation at the sushi bar. ?You get your own personal sushi chef (maybe shared with another couple). ?It's an educational experience - they are serious about their craft and sushi eating etiquette. ?You will get disciplined if you eat it the wrong way. If you aren't sure what to get or feeling open-minded, just ask the chef for his choices...he'll keep going until you say stop. ?And you never want him to stop! If my wallet had never ending supply of money, I'd sit and eat all night. ?It's actually good that we save this place for special occasions.

Still my favorite sushi place in the city. ?This place is amazing. ?Amazing quality and freshness. ?The pre fixe is a great value. ?For about $25 you can still get 4 pieces of sushi, 3 types of sashimi, 1 roll, and a dessert for about $25. ?I got this plus, I added on some additional pieces of sushi plus an appetizer. The flash fried prawns were great, you add your own salt. ?Monkfish was good. ?The sushi rolls were also very good. ?I also got the CA uni, which was amazing. ?Very fresh and you had a large chunk of uni with the rice. ?Got the toro as well, which was very good. ?Delicious, fatty, and fresh. ? One of the best sushi places I've been too.

I was debating between a 4 or 5, but would have given Yasuda a 4.5 if there would be an option to. The fish is of outmost quality, and the Omakase (traditional Edo style, no fusion here...). Atmosphere and service are superb, it feels like back in Tokyo which all the Salarymen and Masters-degree Sushi chefs at the bar. Because of the popularity (and the money machine) of Yasuda, they allow you a 90 minute stay, but already when it was 10-15 minutes left, the waiter reminds you to prepare yourself to depart. Not a nice feeling especially when your friends arrive 15 minutes late, which gives you only 60 minutes of undisturbed and effective time to enjoy one of the best japanese cuisine in NYC.

I don't know if there is a better sushi restaurant in New York. ?The meat melts in my mouth like butter and satisfies the palates of any sushi lover out there. ?I haven't ever had a bad experience here and even if I have a slight notch in the service aspect, I still think the food is worth coming back to again and again. Don't worry about the prices, they are affordable compared to the likes of Nobu, Geisha, Masa, etc. ?I wish I could eat here every day.

I came here back around 2002-2003. My food buddy suggested visiting the top 5 rated sushi spots in NYC. And this was one of them. We had tickets to see The Producers, a few weeks before Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick retired their run. So to celebrate this funopportunity, we decided to head to Sushi Yasuda. We heard it was pricey so we brought mucho dinero, but I didn't really intend to eat that much fish. Boy was I wrong. This sushi was remarkably, wonderfully delicious. It was melt-in-your-mouth, buttery and heavenly and it should have a star named after it in the solar system GOOD. We spent around 350.00 in total. I'm not kidding. Honestly though...IT WAS WORTH every cent. I don't make that much money, so for me to say that....well... Save your duckets and Come Here.

There probably isn't anything I can say about Yasuda that hasn't been said already. I've been here a handful of time and have yet to do the omakase...someone slap me. I was never a fan of uni until I came here....it was like butter, so rich and delicious. Now I can't get enough of it. The rice has astoundingly good, just a little bit acidic and wet perfectly with the fish. I had the chirashi bowl and could have easier taken down another one. I'll have to come back and request Yasuda as my sushi chef next time.

While visiting NYC for the holidays, my wife requested to enjoy a high end NYC sushi meal, not easily found in San Francisco. ?Based on a sushi fanatic friend's advice, along with my prior one time experience, we booked a Friday night reservation at Sushi Yasuda. Our experience was in line with what the other reviewers wrote, among those who gave five star reviews. We sat at the bar, with Chef Yoshi serving us. ?We could hear Chef Yasuda talking on and on to the eight customers around him. ?We were actually kind of glad to not have to pay attention to Chef Yasuda talking so much. ?Chef Yoshi's food, service, and attention was nearly flawless. We asked for an omakase experience. ?Yoshi indicated there was no special omakase menu, just the option to let him serve one piece of everything from the menu, so long as we were still hungry (and presumably not concerned with the fast growing bill). The nigiri was divine. ?The rice, perfect. ?The rice texture, temperature, flavor, amount, compactness, all perfect. ?The fish, especially the vast selection, was excellent. ?Chef Yoshi dressed most of the nigiri pieces with the house soy-sauce, so there was no need to dip the pieces. ?I felt Yoshi was slightly heavy handed with the sauce, but it was still oh-so-good. Service was excellent. ?Hot tea was frequently served by the servers replacing the entire ceramic mug of tea, not just pouring. We knew going in that the sushi pieces would be small (as is traditional) and prices would be high. ?Our expectations were slightly exceeded in the overall culinary experience. ?The final bill was up there, but not astronomical as expected (perhaps because we did not drink any alcohol). A distinct pleasure to eat at Sushi Yasuda.

You know it's love when you walk into the restaurant and, as your nostrils are flooded with the scent of seaweed, fish, bonito flakes, and warm, sweet, vinegar, you just can't stop drooling or grinning. This place is soooo good. Always order what the chef recommends (supposedly the freshest for that day). I sat at the bar once, and I think that's the closest I've come to the perfection that was my raw sushi breakfast at the Tsukiji market in Tokyo. Go here to get your fix - it's pricey, but not quite as pricey as getting to Tsukiji! Sublime.

Recently had omakase for lunch at Yasuda, and I can confidently say it was one of the better meals of my life and opened my eyes to what sushi can and should be. ?The freshness of the sushi takes the taste and texture of everday fish varieties to the next level. ?Even the Mackeral, which is a bit notorious for being fishy and my least favorite fish, was amazing (no fishiness at all). ? Other Comments: The entire staff, including the gentlemen handling reservations over the phone, was kind and helpful. ?I didn't sense any arrogance that some people have previously mentioned From what I understand, its a bit of a faux pas to dip your sushi in a bunch of soy sauce here, since the chef has already applied the ideal amount of sushi before serving -- so don't be a noob and soak your sushi in soy sauce Also, feel free to use your hands instead of utensils, which is why they provide a dish with a small wet napkin to clean your index finger and thumb Lastly, between my wife and I, we dropped over $350 here, so if you want a large meal that includes approx. 15 to 20 pieces of sushi per person, alcohol, and a seaweed salad appetizer, be prepared to spend some cash......but, again, well worth it in my opinion

In my opinion, Sushi Yasuda is the best place to have sushi in New York (that is still semi-affordable, less $ than Masa). It's definitely more for hardcore sushi lovers though. It's not a "trendy" place, the service wasn't amazing, and the non-sushi dishes were good but not great. My 5 stars are purely for the quality of their sushi. The quality of the fish, seaweed, wasabi, and all of the other little details are what makes this place great. I have only been here once, but it was so good that even if I lucked out and came on a really good day, I can't imagine this place being anything but delicious. We sat at the sushi bar, but not in front of Chef Yasuda (he was away in Japan that week). We ordered everything a la carte, and everything was delicious. For anyone interested in uni, it was the best I've ever had. It was so good that we ordered 3 pieces each. It was so delicious and fresh that our eyes lit up with every bite we took. It makes me happy just thinking about it. And now I've got to go back right away!

AMAZING is the only way to describe the sushi here. The fish is so fresh and the taste unbelievable. Its so fresh and tasty, you barely need washabi or soy sauce. Actually, the sushi chief tells you not to and shows you the proper way to eat sushi. You will completely offend him if you dunk it in soy sauce. For the best experience, definitely sit at the sushi bar. The chiefs are pleasant, attentive, helpful, and ready with any recommendations. The atomosphere/decor is very stark and simplistic. The waiters appear a little abrupt. Expect to see lots of business lunch's and dinners here. And you absolutely must make a reservation. This is a true sushi place. They only serve sake and Japanese beer (little disappointing for me, but sushi completely makes up for it). No special, funky rolls here. Its SERIOUS SUSHI.

I'm a complete sushi snob, so I was excited to go when I read the reviews. In summary, I was slightly disappointed with the result. From what I hear, this is as good as it gets when it comes to sushi in NYC... really? ?Place is definitely popular and reservations are a must. Glad I was able to get a seat at the bar. Well, the fish is definitely excellent. Fresh, and well prepared. Thought the amberjack (shimiajji) and fluke (hirame) [sp?] were fantastic. ?Definitely go with the chef recommendations. The wait staff is very attentive (maybe just a little too attentative for my taste) and the decor is hip, simple and well lit. The one major negative I can point out is that it's definitely pricey. ?Average price on the menu was $4.50 for one order. That's one piece of sushi per one order. That's pretty damn pricey if you ask me. Especially for white fish like fluke... Also the rice was "chewy" as if it were undercooked. ?The Toro Rolls were average at best. It tasted like the toro was "frozen" because it was ice cold The service was a little over the top. When my glass was half full, they'd be sure to fill it. However, they kept leaning over me to clear stuff off without asking or saying excuse me, and that's definitely a no-no for me. I've had much better sushi in LA. But definitely this is an acceptable place to visit if you have the money to burn and you have no other options to go to in NY.

Sushi Yasuda, one of the most noteworthy sushi restaurants in New York City. ? The food is pricey but the quality is top notch. ?The sushi is cut into small perfect bite size pieces and every fish I had literally MELTED in my mouth. ?I usually do not like salmon but even that was good! ?The toro was heaven, one of the best I have ever had. ?K and I ordered the omakase and an additional assortment of sushi to try. ? It was beautiful... ? The service was good however only complaint was that each time we ordered our sake to be refilled it took about 5-6 min. ?This of course in my opinion is too long since I'm the type that drinks a sip of sake with every bite of sushi. ? I must agree with David L's post that their sashimi slices were cut pretty thin, but heck it was good.! ? Enjoy!

Yea, once again, the Yelpers got it right! But no biases--I was introduced to this place because my one of my bestess friends made reservations for the sushi bar for the night that I arrived in NYC. ?I was impressed! You should KNOW: This is no sushi roll place. This is eating sushi like a person does in Japan!! I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The chef makes the sushi in front of you and as he plates it, he explains where the fish is from. For example, we ate tuna that came from different regions and tried to decipher the differences. I love knowing where my food came from and noticing the finer differences between them. SERVICE: Excellent! Polite and attentive waiters, waitresses, hosts, and hostesses

DO NOT TAKE AN EARLY SEATING. ?Read my previous review for reservations after 8pm (later seating). We had a 6:30pm reservation and our waitress was really pushy about us leaving the table right at 8pm - so much so we were done with our meal and dessert by 7:30pm. ?She rushed our ordering, skipped giving us the specials, and hovered over us until we finished food then just yanked away our plates. I understand being timely for the next reserved seating, but this was extremely rude and hurried service - not what I want to pay a premium for. ?The food itself is still excellent but I knocked down a star for the lack of polite service.

I wanted to have a different than normal sushi experience. ?Unfortunately where I live such an experience does not exist for the most part. ?You can of course get plenty of good sushi in my current city of residence but not something that would be considered outside of the trendy and hip sushi places that are found in most cities. ?Some authenticity is therefore lacking. Consequently I reserved a table at Sushi Yasuda in NYC as I was stopping there for a few days prior to a final flight out to Europe on business. ? It was not very easy to find the restaurant at first. However, once you realize that it is the only establishment in its street with a larger than normal window where one can see the entire restaurant from the outside along with its sushi chefs in the background working on what they do best, you know that you have found Sushi Yasuda. The space is quite small and you immediately get the sense that the restaurant was designed for functionality rather than ambiance and experience. ?You really get the sense that you are in a small Tokyo studio apartment that has been meticulously and efficiently decorated to get the most out of a limited space, although I must respect the fact that it is very clean and well done however artificial it may feel. Unfortunately this instantly kills any vibe of romanticism or relaxation as it just seems cold, one may even venture to say robotic. ?The servers are on point and quite organized to where I felt as if I was watching synchronized swimming. I thought this might make it hard to enjoy the meal but luckily I was in quite good company which made up for the complete lack of emotions oozing from this otherwise functional restaurant. The food itself was quite good. ?The appetizers were very delicious and as I was venturing out of my norm I was surprised to find that although I might enjoy a nice piece of steak over this kind of food any day of the week and twice on Sunday, I still enjoyed the experience very much. Everything came out on time and I completely dug the little coasters which look like they are made of miniature bamboos linked together by a piece of string. ?As an admirer of little artistic details the jar in which the Sake was served was absolutely stunning. ?I must admit however that I was confused by how the pot which contained the soy sauce looked and had the exact same patterns as the tiny glasses which were to be used for drinking the Sake. ?Consequently I performed an embarrassing faux pas by pouring the soy sauce in my date's Sake glass and my own. ?I instantly thought that the Sake looked ?a bit thick which displayed my complete lack of Sake knowledge. ?The Sake was delicious and a nice touch to start off my experience even though I had committed "Sakelege". We had some Sashimi to start off our meal. ?The dish was very well put together and its presentation rather flawless. ?The fish very clean and had an extremely fresh taste owing to its high quality. ?Although not my favorite dish I did have the pleasure of enjoying it. Moving right along I ordered for the both of us the Omakase dish. ?We each had 10 pieces of different types of Nigiri Sushi recommended to us by the Chef. ?The presentation was once again thoughtfully laid out and perfectly spaced out with the color combination immediately hitting the eye and a soft spot in my heart which made me salivate for my potential future enjoyment by embarking on this palatable journey. All of the pieces were quite good except for the uni (Sea Urchin). In my opinion it was like biting into a salt water balloon, not the best taste. ?The eel was instantly my favorite. ?The King Salmon/Salmon was quite good too and the crab was just good. ?I also ordered some Toro and liked it a lot but still preferred the eel. All in all Sushi Yasuda was a fun experience but I would not recommend it to someone who does not already enjoy raw food as it can be an acquired taste. Pros: Clean, organized, efficient, fast & prompt service, very good sushi. Cons: Can be pricey for the amount of food served (Eh, it's NYC though! Who cares!), not a place for a date, no cozy ambiance, service can be so fast sometimes where I felt somewhat rushed as we were in and out in only 1.5 hours. ?Although I must be honest and say that I did not mind it as the restaurant did not lend itself as a place to chill out.

My favorite restaurant in the city. ?Unfortunately not affordable enough for me to be a frequent patron - but every time there is a special occasion... I'm there. Imho - it's only worth it to go if you can sit at the counter. ?Likewise, try and get the corner spot closest to the entrance (that's where the head sushi chef sits - who is by far the most knowledgeable and friendly). I had the pleasure of sitting with Mr. Yasuda before he left for Japan - but recently went back and sat with his successor who was equally gracious and knowledgeable about his craft. Don't try and choose yourself - just get the omakase and enjoy.

5-star for the food 3-star for the service I got jipped with my SY experience. ?My reservations were for the sushi bar with my hubby, but last minute plans added another person to our party so we had to dine at a table. ?A lot of menu items had run out, which the waiter would have to return to our table to let us know AFTER we had ordered the item, so that was irksome. ?But the waiter did know his sushi facts and was able to help our guest with all of his questions in a non-condescending manner. On to the fish... By far one of the best sushi restaurants I've been to. ?No sauced up rolls at this joint, we're talking almost too-good-to-be-true fresh fish with amazing texture and that has flavor in *every* bite. ?My favorites were the otoro, engawa and tamago. ?I ordered round after round of each of them. ?My hubby, who is much more sensitive to fishy smell than I am, even commented how everything actually smelled wonderful. The interior was a tad on the bright side. ?You do feel like you're sitting in a big bamboo sake container. ? Minimal decor. ?But again, SY isn't about the bling - it's about purist sushi and the the best of its kind. And next time I *WILL* sit at the sushi bar.

I went here a couple of months ago with a friend and oh my goodness. the fish just melts in your mouth. We sat at the sushi bar and did it Omakase style. the sushi chef asked if there was anything we couldn't eat or didn't like to eat and started working. i loved how we were able to try such a wide variety of fish and did not use soy sauce at all. that's how sushi should be consumed! i remembered the rock crab piece the most since that was my last piece and i definitely asked for a second one. it's definitely an experience and i recommend it to anyone that's never tried it and is adventurous with food.

This time, and what was most interesting about the meal, Yasuda-san used more lemon than shoyu or salt like last time. ?Very interesting.

I don't normally review places with more than 50 reviews unless I really have a reason to do it. But, I have to throw my two cents in the ring and echo all the rave reviews. Sushi Yasuda is the best sushi I've ever had. The ingredients are just so fresh and simply prepared. And, the restaurant is designed as the perfect temple for sushi consuming - simple, minimal, and brightest just around the sushi bar. In a word, irreverent, an altar to great sushi. You must go for the omakase and sit at the bar to watch the magic unfold. It's not officially an omakase, but basically "chefs choice." Never have I been to a sushi place that paid so much attention to detail. Every bite is perfectly sized, meticulously prepared, and if you pay attention the chef calibrates to your every response. It's an experience that you have to have all for yourself. You won't find crazy rolls or overburdened sauces, but you will find a broad selection of the freshest fish you've ever tasted. While it seems completely vanilla, the salmon 3 ways and the tuna 3 ways will change the way you enjoy either fish for the rest of your life.

This place is awesome. It looks small from the outside, but it does open up and is pretty spacious. It is also very clean. The staff are very hospitable. They were all courteous and helpful. The sushi/sashimi here are fresh and top notch quality. The waiters offer great insight on chef recommendations and what are the freshest fishes that they have that are in season. I opted for the sushi pre fixe, and i pretty much asked my waiter to pick all the fishes for me. He picked all solid ones. I was disappointed because there was this white salmon that he recommended but it was actually all sold out. With the pre-fixe, i got the salad. I loved how the salad had dressing on the side and the salad was topped with crunchy fried anchovies. The salty crunchy contrast to the salad was a perfect complement. The fish were clean and fresh, and the rice had the right amount of seasoning and it was the perfect temperature. The fish was so clean and refreshing that dipping it into soy sauce/wasabi did the fish injustice. The green tea here is warm, mild, and soothing. When they see that your cup is getting cold, they replace it with a piping hot new one. The green tea mochi ice cream for dessert is solid. The mochi is slightly on the room temp side, so the ice cream melted rather quickly. However, the mochi skin was so thin and delicate. Wow another winner. I love this sushi restaurant. It is clean and the fish and staff are awesome. I haven't tried Sushi of Gari, so I can't compare it to that but I seriously think this is one of the best sushi restaurants that i have tried in NYC.

What a great way to start a trip in NYC! We had lunch here through a friend's recommendation, and the meal was great - even after flying a red-eye flight from SF. Aside from my experience in Tokyo, I never thought I'd enjoyed eating pieces of raw fish in broad daylight ... until I was at Sushi Yasuda. Getting to chat with with Chef Yasuda was such a treat. It seems he definitely has some dedicated customers, and what's entertaining about it is his attempt to recognize your presence with a random yet descriptive comment, like "nice hat there" or "interesting yellow tie". ?What a jolly fellow ... Your best bet is to order the Sushi Matsu where you get to pick 12 pieces of sushi and a half roll. Chef Yasuda will answer any questions you may have on any of the fish listed and will even show each one to you if you want. The experience at Yasuda reminds me a bit of Sushi Mori in LA. Minimalist design, passionate yet friendly sushi chef, and basic and incredible sushi. Definitely can't go wrong!

Excellent fish, most confusing dining experience of my life. First off, they only do reservations at 6 or 8 which left us eating a very early dinner. But we arrived-- on time per their request-- and were handed two pieces of paper (sushi/sashimi list and special apps) and the full menu. As we read through the menu, it sounded like everything was pretty much different combinations of the same. But when one of us pointed at a menu item, the waitress ran over and handed them another piece of paper. And a pen. With entirely different options than the first sushi list. But then she took away the pen and took out another piece of paper. And then took away the first piece of paper. And then gave back the pen. Just figuring out how to order-- which items require being filled out, and which are not to be written on-- is like a college level course in itself. I ended up with the sashimi platter-- salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. My husband got a king salmon roll, a yellowtail roll, and some a la carte sushi. The yellowtail and tuna sashimi and the king salmon roll were the best I have ever had in my life. The others were definitely up there. The little salad we got at the beginning was yummy and the sake was very nice. Aside from the impatient waitress and confusing menus, the fish here was incredible and I would come back-- as long as someone else was footing the $50/person bill.

Excellent. I can see why Yasuda is considered the best sushi restaurant in New York City. Even for those people who are used to Americanized sushi, they can taste the difference in level of quality and skill of Yasuda. For the connoisseur, no words are necessary. People will complain and say that the portions are ridiculous since the sushi size here are about half the size at any other fine sushi joints, the price is very expensive. That is true. However, you will never fail here at Sushi Yasuda, no matter who you bring. If you have an important client and you must find one sushi restaurant, this will be the place. If you cannot afford to fail in choosing the right one, you will have to go with Sushi Yasuda. There is no risk to fail. In my opinion, that is why it is worth paying for the premium. There is nothing good or bad here. All is excellent. Sit at the counter, and leave it to the chef. Give him an approximate of how much you expect to eat and he will go with the best available progression. Yes, the price could jump, but if you are looking for an Omakase, you should go with Yasuda. Yasuda offers many seasonal, and hard to find fishes from all around the world. For example, if you are looking to have salmon, Yasuda could be offering 10 different kind of salmon that has vast differences. It is an exciting experience. Again, all complaints and taking stars off for being "too expensive" should not be taken into consideration when looking at Yasuda. One thing that has always ticked me off is the guy who takes reservations. He is a classic A$$hole and is very rude. I have always joked around with friends and said that's the reason why they don't have a Michelin Star. Haha.

I can't believe it's not butter!!! Seriously though, I couldn't believe it wasn't butter when I put each piece of melt in your mouth, fresh, amazing piece of fish into my mouth. I made reso early Monday, got reso for 9:15 that night at the bar. I know that going to a sushi place on Sunday/ Monday is the worst but it was a must for my special guest visiting NYC. Where can I start? ? 1) No sign but just that infamous fish logo to indicate you are going to some secret unknown ( yet very known) place on 43rd st. Clean decor, nothing too fancy but nothing too cheapo feeling either. I don't like restaurant that distracts you with all kinds of decorations because instead of focusing on the FOOD, your wandering eyes are well wandering... 2) sit at the bar if you can. You get to interact with the person that's making your meal for the night. You get to connect with them, talk to them, let them know what you like and don't. In any relationship, communication is important and in sushi world, it's very very important. 3) Don't fuss with appetizers because you will ruin your taste buds and ruin your appetite for the real thing. Go straight to the chef and ask for "OMAKASE" which means "It's up to you". You are basically trusting the chef to give you the most fresh, amazing fish they have for the day. Trust me, I'm not a picky eater but picky at how I like my food prepared. For me to say, "it's up to you" is a huge step for me. However, any decent sushi place you go to, you should always ask for "chef's special for the day" because they know what's best and fresh. Go with the flow for once~ 4) Don't bogard the soy sauce. The chef already brushes some on to ?your sushi for you. If you do, it will be like putting ketchup on to your steak ( do people do that?! yes I've seen it too many time. yuckkkk ) Just enjoy it the way it's served to you. please~ 5) ask questions, ask many and smile and nod and learn. did you know that there are salmons that are white?! Well, according to our chef, to catch the white salmon is to catch it before it turns orange. He said the reason why salmon turns orange is because they eat a lot of salmon like when people eat too much carrots they turn orange... anyway, for a whole batch of reg salmon you catch,you might get one or two white salmon. Those coveted salmon that's more coveted than a Hermes bag is given to Sushi Yasuda. Yep, it's that special and that amazing. 6) Be open and try what's given to you. My dinner date for the night doesn't like octopus or squid due to being to chewy. Well, the ones form Yasuda are not chewy but soft and amazingly fresh. It also helps that they knife up the piece for you. I could go on and on but it's really not necessary because everyone should go try Yasuda. Yes the price is pretty steep but it was about the same amount as going to a steak joint. Few things they/ I could work on for my future visits. 1) Less sea salt on some of the sushi pieces. It was prob needed but could have done with less. 2) Ask for less rice on my sushi., so I could enjoy more fish and less rice. 3) Their wet towels smelled like mildew... Not a big fan of mildew smelly towels. 4) Find more friends that would be ok with forking over few bills to go eat sushi because it's hard when they are either vegetarians or will gasp at how much the bill is... =P I can't wait for my next visit!!!!!! =D

Word to the wise: sit at the bar with Chef Yasuda or go here with someone who knows the chef. It's a totally different (and better experience). The previous times I visited I thought it was delicious - extremely fresh sushi that was simple and delicious, by my most recent visit at the bar with Chef Yasuda was absolutely unbelievable. He really knows his sushi and sashimi and can tell you pretty much anything you want to know. Sitting at the bar with him is not just amazing food, its an educational session on sushi. And Yasuda is funny too. If you're looking for fancy sushi with torched fish or foie gras on top, this is not the place to go, but if you are looking for extremely fresh, pure sushi and sashimi this is for you. Don't think this means you are just getting your basic yellow tail and toro and salmon - at Yasuda you get to eat different types and parts of fish that are rarely available anywhere else in NY (I can only think of one or two places in the city that might offer them) and compare different grades and cuts of fish side by side. If you're afraid of the weird stuff this might not be for you, but if you're adventurous and appreciate good sushi and sashimi pull up a chair a the bar and get ready to eat until you can't eat anymore. Word of warning though: this good food comes at a price, so be prepared.

As a sushi lover, this has to be the best sushi I've ever put in my mouth. ?Simply amazing. ?I suggest sitting at the bar - your sushi chef is assigned to you and can recommend what is the freshest and best that day. ? It's very tough to get in to as well...my boyfriend made at least 6 calls before landing a reservation on a Monday night (although I think he was requesting the sushi bar). ?We had to finish by a certain time since our spots were reserved for an upcoming reservation - they are very matter of fact about you paying the bill to turn the table/spot. ? The atmosphere is stark & bright, but it seems modern Japanese in that sense. ?I sent friends here for a birthday dinner and they were disappointed it wasn't romantic enough. ?Needless to say, I consider it to be for those searching for impeccable food than ambiance. All-in-all spectacular sushi!!

I felt like I was back in Yokohama, eating true Japanese sashimi for the first ever... the most authentic sushi experience I have had in NYC I walked in here with a friend of mine without a reservation during a weekday for dinner, we had no trouble getting seated at a table. ?I wish we had sat at the sushi bar as that's my usual preference but those were all taken. ?(Must be more prepared next time!) We took a glance at the list of sashimi they gave us and checked off every piece the chef recommended for the day, plus a several other must-haves (I must get Anago every place I go!!) ?The sashimi does absolutely melt in your mouth, there's no other way to describe it. ?The freshness, the cut, the preparation was all so beautiful and immaculate. ?I was so happy - top 5 best meals in NYC ever!

My boyfriend and I reserved 2 seats at the sushi bar. We had chef Yoshi, who was absolutely amazing and very sweet. We, of course, chose to go with the omakase. The fish was so fresh. It was nothing like I've ever tasted. Surprisingly though, I think I was more impressed with the sushi rice itself. It was sweet, vinegary, sticky but not mushy; had the perfect texture and taste that complimented with all the fish. The service was great. The servers were very attentive and we were seated right away. There is a 90 minute limit, but that is plenty of time. The meal will be pricey; absolutely worth every penny.

The sushi was delicious and the presentation was better than most. I was not very satisfied with the service but that is somewhat expected when you go to a restaurant 30 minutes before it closes. With all that said, the restaurant simply wasn't better than better sushi joints in LA or even San Diego (Sushi Ota). Despite this, the food was priced like NYC and I am not a huge fan of paying more for lower quality.

Pros: ? + Fresh fish. ? + Awesome rice. ?Being Asian, I eat a lot of rice (i.e., at least two bowls a day, everyday). ?The rice served here was just as good as the rice I cook at home, and I only use the best. ? + My sushi chef, Mitsuru, was friendly and accommodating. ? + Loved the atmosphere (i.e., simple and clean). ?

Hands down the best sushi I've ever had. We sat at the bar and ordered the omakase made by chef Yasuda himself. ?He made sure to ask what type of fish we preferred and showed a lot of care in selecting our fish. We didn't have to use any wasabi or soy sauce for any of the pieces. Every piece was a joy to eat. The highlights were the toro, eel, sea urchin and salmon roe. If you really want to get chef Yasuda going, talk to him about wrestling.

Ok, I'm not one to EVER use silly teenage acronyms, but OMFG that was good. ?No other way to describe it comes to mind. I'm in town from Chicago for work and decided to try Sushi Yasuda based on such great Yelp reviews, and boy was it good. ?I recommend that anyone seeking good sushi go check out Yasuda and sit at the bar. ?I basically had a dedicated sushi chef to make whatever I ordered and recommend things as I went. ?It was all so incredible. ?Puts Chicago sushi to shame. ?Hell, puts sushi at every place I've ever been to shame.

NYC has oodles of quality sushi joints that serve quality fish, some domestically sourced, some flown in from afar. What sets Sushi Yasuda apart is the complexity and the art of the rice preparation. Check out this excerpt from their website: "Perhaps the most complex and difficult part of making sushi is perfecting the rice. Yasuda uses a domestically grown mix of Japanese short and medium grain rice, combined with Japanese red and white rice vinegars, Japanese sea salt and small amount of sugar. The water has been purified with bincho-tan (Japanese charcoal). He cooks the rice in precise proportions at calculated temperatures for a specific time. Like a scientist in a lab, he has revised his method after years of research and experiment. Using his hands as an instrument, he evaluates how moist the rice is before cooking it. He adjusts the amount of water accordingly. The rice is cooked evenly, is subtly sweet and is the ideal "stickiness" to conform to the shape of the inside of Yasuda's hand. He applies six swift strokes and a delicate pressure to the rice to control the amount of space between the grains and to achieve the particular density, size and shape he deems suitable for the kind of fish or vegetable to be placed upon it." I would recommend calling ahead to secure seats with Yasuda-san at the bar for omakase. Having the additional philosophical sushi-talk from the master made the experience that much more memorable. Seating at a table makes it just another trip to any good sushi joint.

Perfect sushi. The best sushi restaurant. They got best ingredients and they know how to take care about it. The wait stuff are knowledgeable. If you have anything you can't eat (allergic to some thing or religious reason ), tell them, so they will assist with you. Getting any of the Prixe Fixe meal first, then extra pieces later is best deal. Even you can ask let chef choose your Prixe Fixe meal pieces. This restaurant serve authentic sushi, so no American Roll sushi; no spicy roll, no tempura roll, no cream cheese roll. They serve The Best EDOMAE Sushi.

The quality of the fish offered is unbelievable. The downside of Sushi Yasuda is the portion size. My friend and I got the omakase. Although it was delicious, it was definitely not enough to fill me up. The uni was OK..not that great. My favorite piece of fish was definitely the FATTY TUNA CHEEK! It's probably the best piece of raw fish I've ever tasted. It's sweet, tender, with a little bit of fat content. It melts in your mouth! It's extremely difficult to find a sushi place I like. I have yet to find a favorite spot. Most places are a) Chinese owned and/or b) poor quality. I go strictly for the fish. But if I know the quality is not going to be that great, they better have some really good rolls to mask the fish. Having said that, Sushi Yasuda carries great quality fish. It's very expensive, maybe too expensive but it's the price you pay for quality. I'm looking for quality but with a bit more quantity. I don't think I'd come back again but it was a great experience. I really wanted to give it 3.5 stars.

Wow. Love, love, loved it! ?I am definitely impressed. I'm originally from California, and have had my share of really good and quality sushi. But this place was AMAZING! The service was excellent, the waitresses are extremely aware of your needs, from getting you a hot new cup of tea even when yours isn't done yet, but it's already gotten luke warm, to neatly cleaning off your sushi plate with a towel so that stray pieces of rice are cleaned off. The atmosphere is nice, because it's not too loud, so it's a good place to chat without having to yell over loud patrons unlike most new york restaurants. We sat at the bar and I got the fixed price sushi which I think is the "best bang for your buck". It was only 26 dollars, and you get a fair number of sashimi, rolls, and half off dessert (the green tea ice cream was delicious, and made in house). If you go, definitely try to get a reservation before hand, and sit at the bar!!

we did the omakase dinner, with chef tatsu(?). he was perfectly friendly and open to chat with us. seemed that the other couples didnt chat as much with their chefs as we did. you're paying to have the opportunity to speak with the chef!! make use of the time! DUH!!! we were seated immediately and instantly served with water or tea, and a warm towel. they place a menu in front of you with the recommended items circled. then you start your journey. you can order or you can let the chef decide. we aren't too adventurous so we decided our fate by ordering every few bites. the chef delicately places the sushi on your little tray, no soy sauce or wasabi needed as they already tucked that into the sushi pieces. between the two of us, we had 4 types of salmon, 3 types of eel, 3 types of mackarel, 2 types of tuna, and oyster/uni/rock crab/sweet shrimp/branzino/seabass/salmon roe. my faves are definitely - alaskan king salmon- melted like butter! - oyster- so fresh and delicate like butter, not briney - sawani eel- sweet but not too sweet, and perfectly warm - uni- everything you want uni to be we had the fried shrimp appetizer which was okay.. nothing too special. we also had the mochi ice cream for dessert. our bill with about 25 pieces per person btween me and my bf came out to approx 300 with tips/tax. not too bad. definitely worth an experience!! can't wait to go to japan and do it again!!

This is a review written after 3 visits... so I figure I have given it my fair shake.... Reservations: I have never made reservations, but you kind of have to know when to go. Try to go a bit early, for both lunch and dinner, and you will be able to get seats at the sushi bar. Now, Yasuda san doesn't work the lunch shift or on Sat, but I feel that the quality of their sushi chefs are strong across the board. (This is unlike Kanoyama, my favorite sushi place, where you can only sit in front of Nobu or Diago, b/c the other 2 sushi chefs can't be trusted to do the omakase....) Ambiance & Service: Very clean and simple decor... nothing fancy. Service is ridiculously good..... but... hmmm... those hosts at the door look like they are from the yakuza (Japanese mafia) Food: See, people complain and say this place is overrated because they don't know what to order. Frig. You can get plain salmon and tuna everywhere, getting it from Yasuda won't be that much better. The whole point of coming to a place like yasuda is to try their menu of more exotic items that you can't find anywhere else. Aside from the collection of exotic items, two things stand out. Variety: Instead of letting you dip everything in the plain soy sauce, most sushi items didn't require any soy sauce as the chef will put on different sauces, salts and spices for you. Attention to Detail: As opposed to every place I have seen, Yasuda is the only place I know that cooks the shrimps on order, (as opposed to pre-cooking them and putting them in the fridge). This is the only way to keep the shrimps from being tasting dry. = ] Lessons Learned: Go early, sit at the sushi bar, go for omakase....oh, and try to expense it if you can.... you can easily spend between $100 to $200. Probability of Returning: 100% Cheers, Wilson

Ate here twice before writing this. First time was at a table. ?The service was friendly and efficient, but the Omakase left something to be desired... I don't like getting platters of sushi, when having sushi, which might have had something to do with the disappointment I felt. ?The fish was fresh, and good, but the rice, was a little colder than what I would've expected, from what has been touted as "the best sushi in Manhattan". First experience, I'd give them 3 stars... Mostly because my expectations were high and the food, just wasn't as exceptional as I was expecting. Second time, I had 2 seats reserved at the sushi bar. ?On a date, got stood up, so, well... Fuck it. ?She missed out. ?Again, I asked for the Omakase. ?The rice was the perfect temperature, just over room temp, sitting at about 55 degrees. ?The fish, was fresh, and amazing, since my date didn't show, I ate like a pig, trying to make up for both of us. ?And drinking... I asked my personal chef (which he was... Apparently he was supposed to serve us 2 at our reservation) what would he be drinking that night, and he answered honestly. ?Wonderful choice in Sake, paired well with everything he dropped in front of me (yes, yes, Sake is cheating, but it was still awesome and fair priced) We even started talking about how amazing the rice was... He told me "the secret" though, I'm sure it will take me at least 6 years to get it to where I want, in comparison. We also got to chat about Masa, and how, yes... It's good, but it's expensive and a completely different style/environment as well as, well... Bar Masa is really disappointing for the price... But I digress... Best sushi I've ever had? Not sure - The other amazing Sushi place I've been is on the other side of the country... It's hard to compare, and it's a different style of service. I would give this place 5 stars based on my second experience, but 3 on my first, so I just averaged it... If you can't get a seat at the bar, I would say, don't bother. ?There's plenty of other places on the island that you can get equal quality sushi (though, maybe not the selection) at a more fair price. ?If you get into the bar - Totally worth it.

The best sushi in NYC (together with Sasabune). We were four people and got the omakase - a great choice. The fish was tender and had excellent taste. I would highly recommend the branzino and trout, though the standards like fatty tuna and king salmon were excellent too. The restaurant is plain, in a boring neighborhood, and with a non-sceeny crowd - so only go there if you're looking for no-frills excellent sushi and make a reservation in advance.

Usually, the thought of sushi usually brings conjures up images of rowdy, crowded unlimited sushi/sake places, where the waiters bring out sake faster than they bring out the sushi. ?This place is not one of them. ?In fact, it's the opposite- a place to bring someone for an intimate, relaxed dinner, or a place to seal lucrative billion dollar business contracts with Russian businessmen ?(one of those is true for me. ?No, I don't speak Russian, try again.) If I were more knowledgeable about how sushi should taste, I might have given Sushi Yasuda 5 stars just like the vast majority of yelpers assert. ?However, after a certain level, I am unable to tell the difference between really good sushi and really really really good sushi. ?This place was really good sushi and sashimi, but is it the best? I'm too ignorant to say for sure. ?But it is indeed really good food, and I'd come back. ? I definitely did not drop the kind of money that makes this place $$$$. ?I took advantage of the $25ish pre fixe option found in the back of the menu. ?It is a good option to try a variety of dishes without breaking the bank, and it was definitely a good way to sample the wide culinary offerings of Sushi Yasuda. ?One day, I will be canoodling with Russian billionaires, and when that day comes, you'll find me dropping $$$$ at the sushi bar here.

Sushi Yasuda is a real treat. ?Just hand over your Amex as you walk in the door, and let them take care of you... Great service and even friendly patrons sitting at the next table await you as you enter Sushi Yasuda. ? We enjoyed the crunchy fried amaebi appetizer, and crisp cucumbers with an interesting miso paste was refreshing. ?After that, each morsel of sushi was melt in your mouth delicious. ?Every piece of fish was brilliantly sliced and carefully placed on pillows of rice to create a perfect bite. ?They even season it with soy sauce and wasabi, so you really don't even have to dip it in additional soy sauce. ?Just pop each piece in your mouth and savor the true flavors of each fish. ?I loved that there is a diverse selection of fish - most of them not even available elsewhere. ?Three types of clam, several varieties of yellowtail, and of course lots of cuts of tuna. ?Liked the way they did their oyster nigiri. ?Sushi Yasuda is a nigiri sushi lovers haven! But the highlight here was the uni. ?Not even wrapped in nori, it just sits elegantly on rice, already seasoned with a little sea salt. ?It really stole the show. ?We even had to order a second round, and one for our neighbors. ?It's a must have, must try - just eat it. ?I liked the uni hand roll too, but was horrified when the nori from the hand roll got soft. ?It was a little tough to bite... then a stray piece of blackness stuck in my teeth. ?No one told me! ? When I save enough pennies for next time - I'll be back to Sushi Yasuda. ?I'll avoid the handrolls and stick with whatever is most fresh.

My BF and I had our one year anniversary at Sushi Yasuda and it was AWESOME! We called for a reservation one month in advance and chose to sit at the bar because we love to watch sushi chefs make sushi. ?We were seated in front of Yoshi and Mitsu who were very entertaining and informative! The sushi was wonderful! Everything was very fresh and tasty (we had to have scarfed down at least 30 pieces in an hour and a half). ?The rice was awesome! ? Remember, you cannot compare this restaurant to Soto. ?They are two totally different restaurants! ?I'd say that Yasuda is the best sushi spot in New York.

I love sushi and eat it about three times a week. Now that I'm dieting I've eaten more sashimi in the last two weeks than I have in the last year. I was treated here for lunch last week so while I can't attest to the cost (well kind of, I DID peek) I can comment on the food. Let's start with the apps. I don't eat edemame but I obviously like fish. The cod was....not good. Just not good at all. My fellow diners were in awe of it but it was just all butter and not in a good way. The pieces of sashimi were on the smaller side but that was I guess okay for the assumed price but they didn't taste fresh at all. I was bored with them. The sashimi over rice was...well, the rice was rock hard. It was so hard that I didn't feel bad not eating it. Three stars for constantly replacing my green tea and ensuring that I never had to drink it cold. Also for the fruit. It was freshest I've had.

They're not messing around here. All business, all the time. The servers were clearly told not to eff up and trust me, they don't. I'm a huge fan of the lunch special (though the ordering can get a bit complicated). This isn't a cheap sushi option but honestly, it's worth going to a spendy sushi spot every once in a while - the difference in the fish is obvious. Oh, and don't dawdle, this is about efficiency and art not a 3 hour lunch in midtown followed by a trip to Bendel's. All business, all the time - don't forget.

:-? I tried. I really tried to Love the sushi. The sushi shop is heralded as Best in New York by young and old, near and far. ?I came twice. Ordered different sets. Ordered some appetizers. Came and left. But, TRUTH be told -- I was not amazed. *bummer* I admit maybe Chef Yasuda wasn't sitting in front of me and preparing my sushi. I admit I have a particularly picky palate for sushi, since I've grown up eating sushi from the famous Tsukiji fish market in Japan. But, I have explored the sushi scene in America, and the fish I had on both days were not the Best in America or in NY. Not even close. (But the price was fairly mediocre as well. 60-75~) Why? With my eye, I could tell which slices of fish were or weren't so fresh. ?With a taste, I confirmed my worries. (And between the 3 people at our table on my 2nd visit, there was an extreme lack of consistency. Yikes! Looks-wise, at least.) The Hamachi: good, but that's how it should be. The Toro: melt-in-your-mouth one day, average the next. The Uni: too much soy-sauce the first day, and sloppy but satisfying the next. The Oyster: a tad fishy. The Hirame: not fresh. Anago (both preparations): not fine and tender enough. Tuna: truly tasty, for tuna (bc I detest non-toro tuna). Other fishes: ups and downs, but nothing fantastic.. ONLY the Scallop was a stand-out: excellent on both days. (& the Tamago egg: A+) Environment-wise, Yasuda felt much akin to an upscale Japanese sushi parlor, but without the tatami and Japanese greetings. Spacious. Wood-paneled walls. Hot towels. Hot tea. Polite waiters. Post-meal hot tea. All-in-all, bring your visiting friends or relatives here if you wish to show them your sincerity -- because you had to book a week or 2 in advance. Plus, you won't break the bank. However, don't bring your boss or your date here if you wish to impress. Especially, don't bring a Japanese boss/customer/friend here. Kuruma and Sushi Seki are my next sushi destinations. Updates ahead.

Yes, everyone and their mother has reviewed Sushi Yasuda. Now that the cat's outta the bag that Chef Yasuda will be going back to Japan, everyone is in a bum rush to hit up this resto before he leaves. Sushi here really is THAT good. ?It will definitely set you back a benjamin or so if you eat enough sushi until your full, drink some sake and have some dessert. ?But, it is well worth it. ?This place and Jewel Bako are definitely two of my faves in the city for sure. ? The only thing is that the ambience is not what I expected since it is super bright and the wood reminds me of birch veneer from Ikea. Fatty Tuna, Uni, Scallop - MUST EAT! ? Uni here is like no other, super creamy & buttery goodness that melts in your mouth & not in your chopsticks!

Holy mackarel! With no less than five types of that fish, and maybe another five of eel of both freshwater and salt variety, Sushi Yasuda shows that variety is indeed the spice of life. This is truly the place for hardcore raw afishionados, with its emphasis on ultra-fresh sushi prepared with uber-skill. ?I have to agree with other recommendations to NOT douse the fish with soy sauce to truly experience delicious sushi the way Neptune intended. Now I'm no Andrew Zimmern but this joint made me a fan of "scallop guts," which looks kind of like orange uni, but texture-wise is not soft and slithery--it's firmer with a saltwater taste explosion upon munch. Oh they have the regular stuff too, equally excellent as the exotic offerings. Prices are on par with average Manhattan dining establishments, meaning if you have enough money for a daily Starbucks, this is really affordable. Otherwise, it's a reasonable special occasion place. ? Though honestly, anytime you come here is a special occasion on its own. Believe the hype!

Note: This review is for when I ate at Yasuda's two months ago. ?I just got around to writing it. I sat at the sushi bar, and Chef Yasuda was my chef. ?My friends and I ate omakase style. ?I highly suggest you go omakase, too, if you have Yasuda as your chef! The atmosphere and decor of this restaurant are nice. ?I've eaten here a few times, and I like how it's simple and clean. The service was very good, but I think that's to be expected from a place like Yasuda's. ?The waitresses are attentive, ready to clean the bar, give you more tea or sake, and so on. Regarding the actual nigiri that I ate, I tried many different kinds of fish, including white king salmon, cherry salmon, bluefin tuna, unagi, anago, halibut, and Spanish mackerel. ?The menu is organized into different groups of fish; for instance, the "tuna" section can consist of normal tuna and bluefin tuna. ?I like this, as I can try different variations of a fish that I love; for instance, I like how I'm able to try silver salmon, cherry salmon, white king salmon, and so on! The sushi's generally very fresh, and Yasuda likes to add his own sauce to flavor each piece of nigiri a bit. ?There are a lot of species of fish on the menu, and some are unavailable depending on the season. ?Overall, though, there are a lot of choices of fish for you to try! One of the last things I ate was a salmon roe roll. ?The reason I bring this up is because his seaweed is amazing. ?That's really all I have to say about this, haha; if you can, try the seaweed! My friends and I got green tea and red bean ice cream as our desserts, and the ice cream was, of course, good. ?You can't really get this part wrong, though! I personally think that, of all the sushi restaurants I've had so far, Yasuda has the best sushi rice in the city. ?The fish is fresh, which is great, but his sushi rice really does make you realize how important good sushi rice can be. I don't know if Yasuda's has the best sushi in the city, but it's definitely one of the best, in my opinion. ?The total bill came out to be $150-200 per person. Oh, yeah- Chef Yasuda also gets bonus points in my book because he's buff as hell for a sushi chef!

There's better sushi in New York. ?This place isn't bad, just not great. ?Compares well with Kuruma Zushi and Sasabune. ?Doesn't compare with Tokyo. ?And as such, is lacking compared to a few others in NYC, as a few do not need the caveat "good for new york". Apart from the food, will say the service is lacking and not creative. ?Head chef is rather arrogant, undeservingly so.

Very good, but it's WAY overrated and I won't go back again, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars. My first qualm is that the sushi pieces are small. Yasuda claims sushi chefs are being "lazy" when they cut big pieces. But they cut big pieces in Japan. I think Yasuda is just being "stingy". The flavor of the fish is undoubtedly good. Favorites were the tuna, uni, and shrimp. But is it worth the price? No. Especially not when Tomoe Sushi is also in Manhattan. Honestly, the flavor of the fish gets 4 stars, but for the price, I knock it down to 3. One notable item is the sake. The waiter suggested a $10 carafe that was absolutely fantastic. I'm not a huge sake fan, but this was so smooth. I forget the exact name, starts with a T and is $10. Try it! I'm glad we went because we'd heard so much about Yasuda. We now know to never go anywhere for sushi in Manhattan except for Tomoe.

Master chef Yasuda-san is a legend. I had the privilege to eat at his counter only a couple of weeks before his departure. The quality of fish and rice -- its freshness, temperature, texture, size -- was beyond superb. My favorite was the rich, milky uni and fatty salmon. What made the meal even more special was the conversation I had with Yasuda-san about the philosophy of sushi. He is a traditionalist with strong conviction and values authenticity. It is sad to see him go, but he believes his mission in New York is done. He'll be back in Japan to educate and nurture young sushi chefs there, to bring back the long-lost art of sushi.

Warning: Stepping through what looks like the doors to Sushi Yasuda will take you through space and time! ?Shhh...don't tell anyone, but it's actually a portal to Japan! ?This place is no joke. ?They purposely hire only Japanese people to work at their restaurant. ?It's so bad that I couldn't understand my waitress and I'm Asian myself and used to the "Asian" accents! ?I feel bad for the Gaijiin's who have to try and order stuff here. ?But even if they get your order wrong or you mis-order because you can't understand, I don't really think it matters because everything here is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!! ?We're talking about sushi that melts in your mouth like cotton candy. ?I've only heard myths of this level of sushi and I think I've finally found the mythical sushi and it's here at Sushi Yasuda!

Best traditional sushi in NYC. It was three of us, at the bar, celebrating my honey's birthday. Heavenly uni (and I'm an uni girl), the rice itself is revelatory, everything was just perfect. Expect to spend 80-100 per person for the adventure. That includes hot sake. More if you decide on cold and/or premium sake. Our chef was exceptional artist (Tatsu?). And get there on time. They don't mess around. All in all, pure delight. I will return.

Wonderful service, atmosphere, and most importantly the freshest sushi you can find. When I came here I ordered the Omakase. You really can't go wrong. The texture of the sushi was perfect-soft and it felt like it melted in my mouth-like butter baby! What really got me hooked was the octopus. I never eat octopus as sushi usually because the texture is rubbery and hard to chew. I didn't know what to think when the master chef served me some octopus-I wasn't going to refuse it, that would have been rude. I gave it a try... and ?now it's my favorite piece of sushi there! This place is a sushi connoisseur's paradise.

All the annoyance I felt about being seated next to the bathroom, being rushed by the waiter and feeling dumb about sifting through so many menus melted away when the Freshwater Eel Sushi melted in my mouth. Literally, as in you do not need jaw muscles to consume this thing. Made perfect with their divine rice, all the sushi had this non-fishy quality about them which you can't find anywhere else. The Eel was my favorite though. I walked out of the restaurant wanting to convert my currency unit to Sushi Yasada Freshwater Eel, as in, please pay me in SYFE, I only accept SYFE from now on.

The best sushi I've ever had--and I've been eating sushi for years. ?The fish is melt-in-your-mouth fresh. ?Yasuda raises the bar so high that it's now difficult to eat at "normal" sushi restaurants! The decor is very minimalist, so don't expect much atmosphere. ?This is a shrine only to honor the integrity of the fish. Sushi fans will also appreciate the nod to Japanese traditions. ?The restaurant provides a sushi-eating primer, so you can learn how it's really supposed to be done!

A friend and I came to Sushi Yasuda on a Tuesday night without a reservation (as we had just spontaneously decided that day to have sushi). Because we didn't have a reservation, we were asked if we would be done by 7:30PM. That being what seemed like ample time to finish our meal, we said yes. We had the flash fried blowfish to start. It was my first time having blowfish, so I didn't quite have anything to compare it to.. but it was delicious! And not at all fishy like I had expected it to be. We then shared the sushi matsu and the maki combination. The fish was fresh, and the rice and seaweed perfect. The chef's selection was varied and each unique, but my friend and I agreed that our favorites were most definitely the eel and the toro. My only gripe about this place was that although we had nearly two hours for our meal, I felt a bit rushed. Our waitress seemed too eager to clear our table--almost as soon as the last pieces of sushi was in our mouths. I understand that we didn't have reservations, and they may have needed time to prepare for their next guests. But we were not quite nearing our 7:00PM deadline. Two things we learned for our next visit: 1. Make a reservation. 2. Sit by the sushi bar..that seems to be where all the action is!

When visiting a world-class city like New York, you have to get world-class sushi, right? Everything I read told me that Yasuda was the place, so Yasuda is where I went. I made a reservation for my boyfriend and I with Chef Yasuda himself, since that's what you're supposed to do, right? First impression: I loved the minimalist interior and the quiet comfort of the place. I started with a little bit of sake (I can't remember the name, but it starts with a k, ends with an i, and it was so very good). My boyfriend was disappointed they didn't have wine on the menu, but was okay with settling with beer. We each started with the 12 piece special and then yet Yasuda take charge. Highlights for me: oyster, scallop, sardine, the second of the fatty tunas Yasuda gave us, atlantic char roll, and the uni. I'd never had uni before, so I thought this was a good place to try. I don't think my boyfriend dealt with the uni so well, but I give him props for trying. He loved everything else, but especially the eel, fatty tuna, and the scallop. I found it very interesting to hear from Chef Yasuda about the fish, where it came from and such. He did scold me for eating my nigiri upside-down. Apparently what I see on Iron Chef isn't always the right way to do things. The focus here is the fish, and only the fish. Definitely different from the places I normally go where the focus is more on rolls. Don't get me wrong, I'll still love all of my other favorite sushi spots with all my heart, but it was great to have a more traditional sushi meal for a change. At the end, Chef Yasuda asked, "To be continued?" Sure, let me just find a way to get back to NYC. :)

I came here with my siblings and cousins (six of us total) when my siblings came to visit from Atlanta/DC. ?The sushi was incredible, but a few things prevent me from giving it four or five stars: - We almost walked right by the place because of the horrible fish stench just outside the doors. ?Good sushi places should not smell like fish, and I know it's midtown Manhattan and it was probably the smell of their trash, but it was still not the best introduction to the restaurant. - Out waitress, while beautiful and seemingly very sweet, had the softest speaking voice I've ever heard in my life. ?She also had a very strong accent. ?The accent alone would have been fine, but I was sitting at the corner of the table and she was standing right over my shoulder as we ordered and I STILL couldn't hear what she was saying. ?Not the best characteristic for a waitress, right? We got the omakase, aka the chef brought us what he recommended that night. ?We ended up getting about 42 pieces of nigiri style sushi, which was plenty, especially since we started off with delicious salmon skin. ?I'm not sure if I remember all the types of fish we had now, but definitely included were fluke, salmon, tuna, yellowtail, scallop, clam, and eel. ?They were all great - you could definitely taste the quality of the fish - and the fatty tuna and eel especially stood out. ?I was expecting some more adventurous types of fish though - the omakase is supposed to be what's freshest and best that day, and surely not only the very normal, "safe" kinds were fresh? I absolutely LOVED the decor - the floors and walls were all light-colored wood which was a little discombobulating when I first walked in but the overall impression was very warm and light and welcoming. I think our experience would have been much, much better if we'd had a waitress we could have communicated with, because for this meal in particular we had a lot of questions. ?If/when I go back, I'd love to sit at the bar, where patrons were being served by the chefs themselves. ?I bet the omakase in one of those seats would have been divine.

ORGASM in my mouth! This is definitely the best sushi restaurant I ever been too!! Nothing else compares--I wonder if Japan is this good? Definitely really pricey--the four of us, and the bill came out to be over $500. Thanks Mr. S =) We sat at the sushi bar, and that's the place to be! No, you don't want to sit at the table. We had some Crab guts (i am sure there's a better word for that), blow fish, and individual pieces (over 15 pieces each person) of sashmi from around the world--like 3 different types of salmon. They put the soy sauce on there for you already so no need to dip soy sauce and the best part is you use your hands! The sushi chef is very knowlegable, and he explains to you about each fish. My favorite would probably be the Toro and Unagi and White stripe(?). ?Too bad they didn't have butter fish. The service was great---Very attentitve and my cup of tea and water was ALWAYS full. Ah, i love it. This definitely made my trip worth it, along with all the perks we had on this trip.

Oh man, fond memories of this sushi place. They've got a GREAT deal for the pre fix! Highly encourage you to get it. I think when I was there it was like $21 for the pre fix, nicely filling, and came with a green tea mochi at the end. You can pick from a selection of fish. I just remember that I had one clam type of thing, and it was so fresh and crisp. I don't think I've ever felt such a texture in my mouth from clam before! White fishes (Japanese traditional fishes) are superb as well. If budget would allow, I would go here all the time. Sake selection is great too. Cold Sakes are the way to go, and they'll pair a sake for you. Hint: if they see you eating the sushi like with your fingers, popping a whole piece into your mouth delicately, they'll secretly bring over a nicely shaped wet napkin so you can clean your fingers in between an indulgence. They'll tell you what's great if you ask. And they know their fish well. Don't fool around with extra soy It'll muddle the fish and rice. You can really savor the flavor of the expertly prepared rice and fish as they meld together.

I have to agree with yabad's review in my rating. Sushi Yasuda is just not my cup of tea. it is probably due to the fact that I am not a sashimi lover and I'm a fan of places that are priced for the average person. Service: A++ our waitress was so cute with her mannerisms and Japanese. Ordered from their special appetizer menu a fish that was grilled and that was delish! Loved it. Sashimi: ordered a variety from the white fluke to the toro to the tuna to salmon. My friend visiting from out of town enjoyed most but she recommended not to get the salmon again. Sushi Yasuda is a bit too outrageously priced for my budget and my tastes are not there yet to appreciate this "quality sushi." I think I'll have a friend come back and tell me whether she thinks it's great. . .

Best sushi restaurant I've ever been to. ?Period. The decor of the place is nothing to write home about. ?To be honest, it will remind you of a sushi place that you'd find in the suburbs. ?But it's not about the interior design here. ?It's about respecting all the wonderful fish in the world. ?This restaurant honors the tradition of sushi and craft in a way that few Japanese restaurants do in this day and age. Don't dare come in here and order a California roll or some gimmicky roll that you order at your favorite sushi restaurant, which I assume is absolutely god awful. ?Go to the sushi bar. ?Tell the sushi chef you want "omakase." ?And let one of their masters work. ?Omakase literally translates to "It's up to you." ?The sushi chef will pick and choose for you. ?Sit back and enjoy. Come if you're all about getting serious food. ?Don't come if you're looking for fake Japanese-American rolls or if you're looking for a trendy, hip restaurant with all the unnecessary bells and whistles. ?This place is simple. ?They let the beautiful fish of the world shine.

Very good, but not the best sushi Ive had in the US, that title belongs to NAOE in Miami, FL. ?Dont get me wrong, everything was very fresh, and the prices werent as astronomical as I had expected. ?I only spent $20 on sake here which is about my average. ?The 12 piece sushi matsu set was only 36, but ala carte after that gets pricy. ?Still i would expect to pay ~$100/ person if you go in hungry. ?They have a pretty vast selection of fish as well. ?They had like 5 different kinds of yellow tail and also salmon, including a white salmon which i never knew existed. ?The Uni was very good and some sea salt was sprinkled on top of the creamy gooey-ness. Ive tried there white salmon, yellow tail, salmon, toro, uni, fluke, sea scallop and the king salmon roll. ?Everything was good, notables are the uni, sea scallop, and all their salmon. ?The sea scallops were actually the ?best Ive ever had. The negatives: the fish and the rice were served too cold, it should be served at room temperature or slightly warmer. ?The nigiri was not brushed with enough soy sauce, required dipping of house soy sauce. ?Fresh wasabi from the root wasnt used. ?My wife thought the vinegar taste was too strong in the rice, although i did not notice it. ?The rice was not bound tightly enough, there was one piece that fell apart in my fingers, and yes you are supposed to eat sushi with your fingers. Desserts: red bean mochi was good, wish it came with more! ?Green tea icecream was pretty flavorful and potent. ? Ive had sushi before in Tsukiji as well as other parts of japan. ?Yes im not expecting that kind of quality here, but I have been to one other place that is better, and my wife was even more disappointed than me since her expectations were a light higher. And for those who havent heard. ?chef yasuda is going back to japan, although the restaurant will still be around. ?He will be somewhat involved in the restaurant, but obviously not as involved as now. Despite all the negatives i chose to give this place a 5 star negatives, because of the variety of fresh available, some that ive never heard of, and also the price wasnt as high as i expected, albeit still pricey.

If I lived in NY, I'd go here regularly. ?I didn't think it was amazing but it was good - traditional, affordable, and fresh. Great ambiance, little off on the service, but overall, a great spot.

Sushi Yasuda has an amazing selection of very fresh sushi. ?I had never been to a sushi bar with such a selection of fish. ?Four kinds of salmon, three kinds of yellow tail, multiple kinds of eel. ?The fish was very fresh and melted in your mouth. ?I highly recommend dark salt water eel, I believe it was called Unagu and was amazing. ?The King Salmon was also very good and the toro was exceptional. I tried a clam based miso soup which had a very interesting taste that I could not quite put my finger on. ?The selection was completely amazing and it was the best sushi I have ever had. So why the 3 star rating? ?The interior was decorated very traditional Japanese with lots of wide open space and very few tables. ?The food was amazing, the only thing bringing this rating down is the fact that our waitress did not speak english whatsoever. ?Her response after asking a few questions about the menu was thank you every time. ?Ordering sake was insanely frustrating, we could not communicate that we needed one bottle for us to share and two cups. ?We wound up ordering by checking boxes off a list of what we wanted. ?We could not take advantage of any of the package deals from the menu or ask any questions about the fish. ?At a place that is as expensive as Yasuda I expect to be catered to in every aspect. ?I especially expect to be filled in on certain details about what the menu offers. Even when I made reservations I could not understand a word of what was being said to me. ?I wound up just giving all the information would normally be needed followed by a string of undecipherable japanese followed by "yea?" ?Luckily the reservation stood. Bottom line, if you speak Japanese this spot will be amazing. ?If not it is still worth it if you want to taste some truly amazing sushi just be prepared to be frustrated at times.

We went right before Christmas and Chef Yasuda was still there but we could not get seats at the sushi bar. Omakase was good, although next time I would get sushi only. One of the best sushi I've tasted. The sashimi pieces did not stand out as much. Don't go starving expecting to be full by the end of the meal.

Came here for the lunch prix fix and let the sushi chef pick for me. ?Originally was thinking I'd have to order a few more things a la carte, but after the 5 pieces and 2 rolls, was quite stuffed. ?The pieces were on the small side, but maybe I'm just used to having bigger pieces? Fish is fresh, service is great, place is clean and they have an excellent lunch prix fix. maybe for dinner with higher prices I might feel different, but for sushi lunch, I don't think it can get any better.

Super expensive, but also one of the best sushi meals I have ever had. Its totally worth the high cost, and I particularly enjoyed sitting at the bar and getting everything straight from the sushi chef. Fresh fish and no 'wacky roll' silliness. I went with my father, and the ambiance is very suited to that kind of dinner and less suited to a date.

I had an odd service experience here that detracted from an otherwise very good meal. Fish: ?Omakase outstanding. ?The variety of the fish was greater than I've ever seen. ?Several types and preparations of eel for example. ?A number of tunas I hadn't tried. ?Other imported fish I hadn't tried. ?All in perfect bite sizes. ?The quality of fish was excellent, at least on par with and in some cases better than other sushi I've ever tried. ?And I consider myself quite the sushi snob. ?Slightly unusual -- and I'm not sure this is common for all the chefs at Yasuda -- is that soy sauce was applied with a brush to the top of each piece of nigiri before serving. ?I've never seen that sort of preparation but didn't mind it. Service: ?Obtrusive. ?I've been eating with chopsticks my entire life. ?I've been eating sushi my entire life. ?Yet when I first sat down, the sushi chef bossily directed me how to hold chopsticks and the proper way to pick up sushi with them. ?He did this with every patron sitting in front of his station, but I didn't see any other sushi chef at the bar do this. ?I found it very objectionable. ?If that wasn't enough, throughout the meal he bragged about the uniqueness of the fish and preparation and prattled almost constantly about why his fish was different and special. ?Now I appreciate pride in work, but I prefer more demure service from a sushi chef, that they engage only when engaged. In contrast to the chef, the wait service was very, very good. ?Attentive, efficient, invisible. I think I had an aberrational experience with this chef and would have given the restaurant only 3 stars because of it but for the outstanding sushi itself.

Dear Sushi Yasuda, I do think you are great. ?Don't get me wrong. ?I was a little upset that you didn't have all kinds of roe spewing fancy shmancy rolls like Japonica, but hey I think I know where you're coming from. ?Being seated at your big beautiful bar and assigned my very own personal chef was how you honored me. ?Having two uniquely different hot teas available was how you surprised me. ?Giving me a bill for $40 bucks without filling my stomach was how you shocked me. ?But I like you Sushi Yasuda just the same. ?I think I shall bring a fellow sushi lover to see you again - very soon.

11/10/07 - Revisited. ?Now that it's fresh in my mind, I have to say this is still an excellent place. ?I went on a Sat nite w/o reservations and though we had to wait, expected, the wait was not long especially for a table. ?We had a bunch of pieces, a roll, miso and a monk fish appetizer. ?The portions were on the small side yes, but I'm not sure what to expect from nyc and fish being flown. ?For desert, green tea and red bean ice cream, I liked the red bean a lot. ?Service was attentive and the quality of our order was top. 1/something/06 - Amazing grade of sushi. ?The service was excellent and our tea was always kept filled.

A little history to start with, I grew up with all vegetarians, so my palate for sushi started in college (only 4 years ago). That being said, ? I like california rolls and other fake sushi like equivalents. ?But even with that, this place was awesome. ?Only caveat is I had no idea that for so much money you get so little food. ?I went a while ago when it was the UN General Assembly, so they wouldn't give us a table, but we sat at the sushi bar... the reason they loose a star is cause the waitress was trying her hardest to push us out so they could get another pair at the bar.

I went to lunch here with a group of my co-workers half a year earlier since we work in the area. My co-worker loves this place! As soon as we entered the door we were greeted by staff in a friendly manner. The decor of Sushi Yasuda was modern and bright. I had the lunch special for approximately $25 of which included a miso soup and approximately 9 pieces sushi. I thought the fish was very fresh. However, it is very basic sushi. I think this place is great for people that appreciate fresh and raw sushi. If you are looking for creative rolls, I don't think you should come here. But I would like to come here again.

I really wish there was more than 5 stars to give Sushi Yasuda. I recently was in NYC, and I went here twice. I would have gone again, but they're not open on Sunday. Make a reservation. I didn't the first time and we got lucky. Prices range from $20ish for a meal to whatever you want to spend. The next time I went I spent well over $100 and was glad to do so. It was that good. I normally don't eat eel, but I ordered all types of eel they had, because it was just that good. Forget the atmosphere (but it's nice. Some might try to sell you on how hip it is and whatnot, but it's really just a minimalist decor and speaks to me about it's philosophy), but just take into consideration the taste of the food. It's better than the crap you normally eat. If you can't tell, you probably shouldn't be spending this kind of money for sushi. Go back to whole foods. As far as the service goes, it was amazing.

Hands down the best sushi and sushi experience. Maybe my favorite restaurant in New York. The restaurant is beautiful: bright, clean lines, stunning wood. The fish is so fresh. Melt in your mouth delicious and the rice is perfect. It's criminal to mask sushi of this quality with soy sauce, wasabi, or asking for it in a roll with crazy ingredients. If you can sit at the bar. If your really lucky (and well funded) make reservations to sit in front of Yasuda and have omakase. He is is incredibly knowledgeable, pleasant, and even funny. ?When I started to get full he laughed and crafted smaller pieces than those made for my male companions so that I could continue to enjoy his work. We continued like that until the restaurant closed :)

If you love fresh sushi, and you have deep pockets, then Sushi Yasuda is the place for you. Featured on "No Reservations" as one of the premier Sushi spots in the US, this place will not disappoint those who are looking for a top-notch sushi experience (I hesitate to use the word "authentic" as I've never had sushi in Japan). With the chef's help, I handpicked an abundance of sushi/sashimi pieces that were on my favorites list, as well as some new fish that I've never tried. Every piece was perfect, in both texture and taste. There is an indescribable sensation when your teeth sinks into that a fresh piece of fish and tears through the meat like a hot knife through butter as the flavors of the ocean burst into your mouth. I really can't recall a better dining experience than my lunch here at Sushi Yasuda. A tip for those curious to try: make a reservation, and make it for the sushi bar. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the food, a big part of the experience was conversing with my chef, getting his recommendations, and watching him masterfully prepare my food. The only thing that will be served if you try to walk-in is humiliation by the host. He will turn you away and he will do so with impunity to the amusement of other guests (such as myself). Make that call, and enjoy what could be the best sushi you'll ever taste!

Hands down best sushi in Manhattan. ?The space is very modern and minimalistic. ?The sushi doesn't get any fresher. ?The nigiri pieces are perfectly made and bite sized. ?SO good. ? Service is good if not a bit too attentive. ?There's basically a guy standing behind you all night. ?I didn't mind though since everything we needed was taken care of very quickly. The best seats in the house are at the sushi bar. ?I'm lazy and I like letting the sushi chef pick what I'm eating for the night... as long as you tell them what you don't like, you really can't go wrong. ?Also, the green tea mochi ice cream is a MUST. ?They dust their mochi with green tea powder, which gives it extra flavor. ?yum!

Let me start by saying that the decor is very nice. The sushi is pretty good. Each piece is shaped exactly the same size (sort of an ellipse rectangle). The service was really excellent. My sake cup gets its own cute bamboo floor mat of its own. Maybe sushi is ordered differently in New York or maybe just at Yasuda but in L.A. each order comes with 2 pieces. Not a big deal, just something to note so you always have to say the exact number of pieces. I can see why others might give this place a poor review based on the host. He basically wants you to dine at the restaurant no more than 1 1/2 hours. I get it, it's popular and the place seats around 40. Usually sushi restaurants display their fish through the window display at the bar for a very specific reason (transparency). For the purpose of nice decor, the glass window is replaced with bamboo. Rather than showing you their fish through the window, they mark ?the fish that is fresh that day on the menu sheet with a red pen (since you can't see the fish at the bar). Again, this is also minor. The thing that I did have an issue with is the fact that the sushi chef decided on my behalf just how much soy sauce and/or ponzu sauce to put on my nigiri so that the sushi comes pre-sauced (on stuff that is normally not sauced at all). I also noticed that there were pieces of kosher salt on my nigiri. Let me just say that I've eaten at lots of very good and usually expensive sushi restaurants in Los Angeles but never have I had a chef decide for me to pre-sauce my sushi (especially since I did not order omakase). If that was what they were going to do, then don't put soy sauce on my table because the message you're sending is that I still have control over my own soy sauce and wasabi. It's one thing to order something that naturally comes with sauce like unagi, albacore with ponzu sauce but it's not normal that simple yellowtail, salmon have sauce. I know some people like ponzu on their salmon and I've even seen jalapenos on yellowtail but to me that just detracts from the simplicity of the original taste. I will say that the sushi was very good but pre-saucing a normally un-sauced piece of nigiri bothers me and is the reason why this place gets 3.5 stars rather than 4 stars. It lost 1/2 a point for pre-saucing my nigiri and the general snottiness of "we're exclusive and we don't need your business" attitude.

I can't believe I've never written a review for Yasuda! ?My boyfriend took me here for my surprise b'day dinner last year, and I was so pleasantly surprised. ? We sat at the sushi bar and directly in front of Chef Yasuda...what a treat! ?Chef Yasuda was humorous and incredibly friendly--you could tell how much passion he had for the food he makes and for his restaurant. ?The sushi was so fresh and delicately prepared by the chefs. ? We were instructed not to use chopsticks (yes, using your fingers to pick up sushi is the right thing to do), or use any extra soy sauce or wasabi because the sushi chefs have brushed on just enough on each piece of sushi--any more would mask the freshness of the fish. ?I loved the raw clams and lobster (yes, raw--amazing).

This was my boyfriend's Christmas present to me. I don't think words do this place justice, but a lot of people wonder why you'd spend so much money for sushi rather than say, a decadent French-inspired fine dining restaurant. Well, you haven't tried Sushi Yasuda or a place of similar caliber then. It's all about the art and the quality. I loved watching the chefs' nimble handles working feverishly fast to mold the rice balls and slice the sashimi. But it's not just efficiency, it's the delicate, dexterous, almost dancing movement of the hands. And the sushi itself was sumptuous. It's definitely a treat worth having every once in a blue moon. I think my favorite might have been the uni, but seriously, I really liked everything. The one minor thing is that the reservationist is extremely brusque, and upon entering the restaurant itself, the host was pretty curt (is it the culture or somethin'?). Also, I had made a reservation and had the inkling suspicion that the two top open at the bar was for us. But once we got there, which was a half hour earlier than expected, they sat us at a table. Now normally, I wouldn't complain about a table over bar seating. But it would have been cool to sit right in front of the chefs and watch them do their work before me. My assumption is that they preferred to give the bar seats to a older couple who might spend more money, like on the omekase which we would've done also. But whatevs. The service was also all right, but not great for a place this expensive. I definitely thought it could be a bit better. So in the end, I'd say 5 stars for the food but 4 for the service.

I tried to catch Chef Yasuda before he left for Tokyo. ?Alas, he was already gone. ?The sushi was still awesome. The aesthetic of the interior is very calming, simplistic and clean. ?Focus is on the sushi. ?We got a couple appetizers which were so-so, like there was some kind of tempura blowfish which didn't taste like anything special. ?But the sushi melts in your mouth like butter! ?I usually refrain from wasabi because I'm sensitive to the pungency, but they add just the right amount of wasabi to complement the fish. ? Get the omakase - like 10 pieces isn't that pricey at all. ?And make sure to get some eel and uni!

Sat at the sushi bar for lunch. They are serious about their reservations. Don't forget to confirm your reservation in the morning! The only time they had available for us was at 1:30pm and the kitchen closed right on time. We had a budget that we didn't want to go over, and we didn't know too much about the different types of sashimi. We asked if we could order the omakase as long as it's within our budget, but they couldn't set a price point, and they also couldn't tell us how much omakase would end up costing. . . . so rather than gambling and ordering the unlimited-price-tag omakase, we ordered a la carte, with our limited knowledge. We ordered about 12-13 pieces each for the two of us, and ended with a bill of about $170 after tips and tax. Pricey! But it was actually really really good. I was amazed at how the sushi chef could remember what we ordered. . . he didn't write anything down until the very end when he completed service.

Our private chef at the lovely sushi bar recommended the day's freshest fish to fill our sushi matsu. ?Each piece was splendid. ?The tuna sushi, for instance, was both clearly superior and decidedly different from any tuna sushi I've ever had. ?He even recommended a sake to accompany his selections ("It is my favorite sake!," he gleefully announced later in the meal). I loved beautiful and restrained interior that looks as if everything was carved from the same wood block. I highly recommend Yasuda for anyone who is interested sushi that lacks gimmicks and puts freshness and flavor first.

I have been to Sushi Yasuda only once - because a) wanted to try other sushi joints but the truth is .. b) I cant afford to spend this type of money on food too often! (though I wish I could...where is my mega millions ticket?) Anyways.. The decor - nothing fancy, just light wooden interior with somewhat bright lights for a restaurent in my opinion. Very clean, minimalistic feel. The service - the service was ok - I had to ask when my beer ran out for another one and waited patiently for the waitress to notice me, but other than that the service was decent. This isn't a place where they fuss over you or where the service if super attentive, but it's passable. The seating - make sure you sit at the sushi bar! Its the best seat in the house! The food - the food just speaks for itself..I have never had such fresh, delicious sushi/sashimi in my life, i SWEAR. The best part is just trying every different variety of fish the sushi chef recommends - even if it is something you wouldn't eat normally at a sushi joint. I loved every bite of every piece of fish I had! Just delicious....As mentioned previously by other reviewers, it comes with wasabi and is already flavored with soy sauce so you don't need extra sauce...That would hinder the taste of the fish itself...Just have it as they present it to you and you will appreciate why this place is so famous! This place isn't cheap, but after my meal I was very happy with the quality of sushi I had just eaten and felt it was worth every penny I had spent! I can't wait to return!!!

Highly recommended! I would consider this one of the best sushi restaurants I've ever been to. Our reservation was with Yasada-san himself. He was quite friendly, full of jokes and had many great suggestions of what to choose next. My favorites: the saltwater eel with sea salt, spanish mackerel and tazmanian salmon. The handrolls were amazing and why? Because he told us they used the 2nd premimum grade of 15 different grades of seaweed from Japan. You can definitely taste the difference from other sushi places. All the fish was so fresh and just melted in your mouth. The service was impeccable. I was amazed at the timing of replenishing my tea to keep it piping hot. It was the highlight of my trip and I seriously could not stop talking about it as the experience was unforgettable!

Sushi Yasuda has got to be one of the best sushi experiences I've had. ?Sushi Yasuda follows Japanese minimalist trend in their menu and their decor. ?I was warned before I got there that Yasuda is known for their minimalism and their fish. ?When I looked on the menu, they had 4 different kinds of yellowtail and 3 different types of salmon. ?I loved all the different types of yellowtail, each with slightly different tastes and textures. ?The Toro was amazing. ?Everything else that I ordered was equally as appetizing. ?I was in culinary heaven!!! ? On a side note: I looked at the menu, and saw prices from $6 to $12. ?I thought 'wow, this is really cheap.' ?Then I proceeded to order massive quantities of my favorites. ?Then my friend pointed out the side note in the menu '*prices are per piece' ?WHOOPS! ?Thank goodness for good friends who are willing to fund my culinary excursions! ? For any die hard sushi nazis out there, go to Yasuda. ?But be warned, it is very expensive. ?You get very little food for your money, especially when you order the more expensive cuts of fish.

I had heard about this place for about two years, and I finally went today. The hype - both in terms of taste as well as $$ - definitely was spot on. Between me and another person, we had 16 pieces of sushi and 5 rolls (they're not that big). The sushi was probably the best I've had -- if not ever, then definitely in NYC. I really like sushi, but I'll also admit that I didn't know there were different variations of yellowtail, salmon, eel, etc. The waitress said that soy sauce and wasabi were already put onto the sushi, but thankfully, it wasn't overly done (I'm not a wasabi kind of guy). I ended up dipping it into soy sauce, but overall, it was great sushi. And the cost? For what we got, the final cost came out to about $175. Thankfully, the person I ate with was a vendor. Domo arigato!

This is the best sushi I've had in NYC - the decor is sublime, the service is impeccable, and food is always delicious. Went here for a birthday dinner, and decided to order the omakase menu from the bar. We weren't served by Mr. Yasuda himself, but our chef was just as capable. We each had an appetizer + 10-15 pieces of sushi, and some sake. Favorites were the unagi and the toro, but everything was very good. Favorite aspect of the meal was how observant our chef was. He would serve us different pieces of fish, and then subtly observe our reactions to them before preparing the next ones. Eventually, he was serving each of us different pieces of fish based on his interpretation of what we would or wouldn't like, and he was totally right. I tried the pieces that he served to others, and didn't like them nearly as much as the ones he gave to me (and vice versa). Very well done! This is on the pricey side for sushi, but you can definitely go elsewhere in Manhattan and pay much more for lesser quality.

I'm not even a real sushi fan, but this place blew me away!!! ? It's all about the rice, and the rice is delicious. However, the fish was refreshing and tasty. ?And we had all the eels, just because! You know sushi is perfect when you really don't think you need to add more of anything. ?Just wonderful bites of heaven. ?I can't wait to go back...

Best sushi I've had in the city hands down! ? Fish was amazingly fresh and well prepared. ?Wish it wasn't in midtown but I suppose it needs a lot of suits to keep it afloat. We just choose a variety of items off the fish list and they were all excellent. ? Bummer on the 1.5 hour time limit but i suppose even in high class sushi joints you gotta burn and turn baby! Definitely coming back to try the omakase next time!!

Had an excellent lunch here last year and sat at Chef Yasuda's corner. ?I didn't know then that he would be leaving the restaurant, I am very glad I made it here before he left. ?A classic sushi experience, as good as any I have ever had. ? Uni was in season then, and I had two pieces. ?They were amazing! ?I also enjoyed the sake list, reasonably priced with excellent selections.

I was lucky enough to have dined at Sushi Yasuda the very last night Yasuda worked before he took off for Tokyo the next day. The decor of the restaurant is minimal,clean and very fresh. The lights are turned so you can see the quality of the fish and the bamboo interior is calming. I recommend doing the omakase at the counter so the chef (mine was ?Chef Yoshi, who was brilliant) can explain all the pieces that you're eating. ?Each piece of fish is expertly cut with just the right amount of rice, dab of wasabi and brushed soy sauce. ?Once you try the sushi here, you'll discover what it means to have quality fish.

Rare and truly deserving of a five-star rating. The fish is as fresh as it gets. The service is impeccable (stand up and walk around the corner and magically your coat is ready for you...how do they do that!???). Lunch prices are very decent. I've been here for lunch 8 times and it's perfect each time. Get there on time. They hate it when you're late. The iced green tea is amazing and refills are free. Order anything. I've not had a bad dish yet.

The all wood-paneled walls and sushi bar counter blended traditional Japanese ambiance with a sleek, modern touch. The 12 fish, 1/2 roll combo for $36 offered a variety of fish (yellowtail, tuna, salmon, squid fin, uni, shrimp, etc) of the chef's choice. Each piece of fish was very good, but the lack of variety in textures and flavors amongst the 12 pieces was disappointing. Out of the 12 sushi pieces, there were really only 3-4 distinct flavors, with the other differences between pieces being very subtle. I would have preferred a more original or unique touch to each piece to liven and differentiate it. As a side note, the unlimited refill ginger was pretty nice and the soy sauce was exceptional--way more complex with a hint of sweetness than your standard store bought soy sauce.

This is a top of the line sushi place. I don't believe there is anything like sushi yasuda. I'm a big fan for several reasons. The interior looks like it should be on a poster for japanese minimalism. Made entirely out of wood, the interior is boxy, and big. It's truly unique. It's worth popping your head in just to see what it looks like inside. TIP: make your reservation ahead of time, and ask to be seated at the bar. It's a table level bar, and the chef's serve you your freshly made sushi. The sushi is realy high quality. So is the green tea (seriously, you must order green tea while you're there. It looks ilke you're sipping duck weed. And it's free!) They have a price fixe option for dinner that hovers around $20. That's an awesome deal. Add an extra $3 for dessert. Sweet. So why only 4 stars? The portions were a little smaller than I would have liked. Still, you can't beat this deal anywhere. Great way to impress a date.

I'm not sure why it took me so long to get myself to Sushi Yasuda but now that I've been here, I'm not sure I can eat sushi anywhere else. Yes, it's not the cheapest place in the world to eat but if you know what you're doing, it can be a great value. ?My last meal at Yasuda with my date, approximately 26 pieces of sushi and sake? ?$127 with tax. ? There are a couple of things to know about Yasuda: ?sit at the sushi bar and let the chefs work their magic. ?Sitting at the sushi bar lets you take in the entire experience, you get to communicate with the masters at their craft and they get to see your expression. ? I've found the best way to go about the menu is to get the sushi matsu. ?12 pieces of sushi plus half a roll for $36. ?After this, I tell the chef what I don't want and let him take over. ?Never has letting go of control for an alpha male been so pleasurable! ? I've gone twice this year and reservation number 3 is in 2 weeks. ?I wonder if they'll let me make a standing reservation...

The problem with sushi is that once you have amazing sushi, you are no longer satisfied with the so-so stuff (I know, first world problems). ?But think about it: you can have delicious brick-oven pizza and still be satisfied with the $3 slice at the place down the block; you can have an amazing burger and still be satisfied with a Big Mac. ?But once you have Sushi Yasuda, you will never be happy with the lower-end raw fish. ?You've been warned. I first went to Yasuda in the summer of 2007 (ahhhhh the glorious pre-recession boomtimes) and ever since, when anyone asks me where to get great sushi, the answer is Yasuda. ? There are two great things about Yasuda: not only is the fish amazing, the price is perfect. ?Yes, this place is more expensive than your normal corner sushi takeout place. ?But for the quality of the fish, the lunch/dinner pre-set menu is really a bargain. ?You get 3 pieces of sashimi, two pieces of sushi, and one roll for about $20. ?You may not be full and will maybe order a few more pieces, but we're not talking arm-and-a-leg prices here. ?My husband and I have eaten here for under $100 total many times. One final note: try the sea urchin. ?I was sooooo skeptical of sea urchin until a nice man to my left at the sushi bar bought me a piece (I was making my "will flirt for raw fish!" face). ?Sea urchin is the cream cheese of raw fish, and Yasuda gets it flown in fresh daily.

I've been trying to be more conservative lately with my reviews, especially the 5-star variety. ?After all, who can really achieve culinary perfection? ?Well, I now know the correct answer to this rhetorical question - Yasuda can (to be precise, Yasuda's 2 proteges and their army of sushi chefs can; I've heard Yasuda has since returned to the motherland, AKA Japan). ? I was expecting a lot from this place to be honest. ?As a foodie and self-proclaimed sushi expert, it's been on my list of to-eat's for about 5 years now. ?And I must say this was one of those rare instances in life when expectations were truly exceeded. ?I was fully satisfied with every single aspect of my visit to this sushi-lover's paradise and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who's really looking to take their love for the fish to the next level. From the instant I walked in I was in awe. ?The entire place is very small and minimalist. ?From the tables to the sushi bar to the walls and floor, it's all made of pale, smooth, traditional bamboo. ?It was all very beautiful indeed, IMHO. ?The waiter definitely thought my girlfriend and I were complete amateurs (which she admittedly is somewhat of). ?I attribute this to the fact that I ordered hot sake, which I believe is kind of a faux pas in true die-hard Japanese spots, which this is definitely one of. ?Oh well, I admit I'm a stupid American, what else can I say. ?I ordered the cheapest hot sake on the menu ($10) and thoroughly enjoyed it. ?It was one of the best I've had and I ordered 2 more. ? Now on to the food. ?We ordered flash fried tuna as an appetizer off the specials list. ?It was to die for. ?As were the house salad and miso soup, the former of which comes with a small bowl of greens and a side of ginger sauce which the waiter instructed my girlfriend to use to dip the greens in (as opposed to the American way of dumping the dressing on the salad I suppose?). ?Anyway, everything was better than average. ?Then came the sushi. ?I ordered the sushi Omakase, with around 8 pieces (the waiter instructed us to tell him of any food allergies we may have, our preferences and potential dislikes from what's on the fish list, and the approximate number of pieces we'd like to consume). ?My girlfriend likes to stay with what she's familiar with, so she ordered sashimi Omakase but asked to keep it to salmon and tuna varieties. ?Her sashimi came beautifully prepared, in small piles of thinly sliced fish. ?Not very large portions by any standard, but the quality was more than enough to offset the quantity issues. ?Most importantly, every bit was delectable. ?My sushi was the same. ?Every single bite was pretty much better than the last. ?The toro was like melted buttery perfection. ?So much so that we ordered a toro scallion roll - which turned out to be the best roll I've ever had. ?Also, if you like eel, be sure to try it here. ?You will likely never have eel that is this good again, at least not in America. ? Anyways, my review is getting a bit long and I could go on forever about this place. ? ?In conclusion, this was the best meal I've ever had. ?It was a bit pricey but was DEFINITELY worth it and I will be back. ?All in all we had a great meal and were pretty full, for around $220 with a healthy tip and like 5 drinks. ?I was recently at sushi of Gari 46 and it's not even in the same league, at least not if you're a true sushi lover. ?Gari has more flash and is a bit more contemporary with unusual techniques and sauces. ?If you are looking for true, amazingly fresh fish, served the way the emperor himself would want it, then Yasuda is the place for you. ?The strangest part about the whole experience is that when I was finished with my meal, I had a strange "buzz" for about 45 minutes. ?This truly was an experience and I can't wait until my newly established "Yasuda fund" fills up so I can go back!!!!!!!

Overall: I know I've said it before, but this place really does have the best ikura. However, this was the first place I have eaten over 15 pieces of sushi, so trust me, this place is amazing. A definite must go to place for someone who loves ikura, tamago, ebi, salmon, sushi, or just high quality Japanese food in general. ? Food: delicious, amazing, mouthwatering. The ikura is out of this world amazing. They cook the ebi when you order, so the ebi is succulent and flavorful, not hard and tasteless like many other sushi places who cook the shrimp all at once. I typically do not order salmon, but I knew it was going to be good. The sushi chef recommended the new Zealand salmon that day, and yum it was fantastic. The tamago was sweet, but not too sweet and I loved the sauce they put on the sushi! The kani was unusual, as they used shredded crab, but it was still tasty. The seaweed salad was an interesting dish. I did not know there were so many different types and that each type had a distinctly different texture, flavor, and look. Atmosphere: Pleasant and not too noisy. I sat at the sushi bar, but the tables seemed spaced far apart enough that diners did not intrude onto others. Staff: Very attentive and helpful. I sat at the sushi bar, and so ordered directly to the chef who was friendly and knew quite a bit about the fish, its origin, and how its prepared. Note: Outside the restaurant they do not have a sign, so look for their logo which is a fish.

Absolutely my favorite sushi in nyc. When I first ate here my initial reaction was that I could not believe sushi could taste like this. PERFECT sushi rice, this is important to me, many places can get the best fish (though maybe not as good as Yasuda) but cooking the rice PERFECTLY takes time and attention which can easily be lost during a dinner service. This is not lost at Yasuda. Order what you like, but also be adventurous, try something new here and trust that you will be thankful you did. This is the case for me and I strongly recommend this spot.

After eating fresh sushi in Japan, it's hard to go to just any Asian fusion place and order sushi...I don't understand brown rice sushi... Anyway, one of the very few places I will get sushi from in the US is Sushi Yasuda. ?I always like to sit at the bar and talk to the sushi chefs! ?Both times I've been to Yasuda, I've gotten the omakase and I've chatted up a storm with the chef so he knows exactly what I like. All I know is that the Uni (Sea Urchin) in New York rivals that of Japan and I would even venture to say that they are sweet in NYC than in most places I've been to in Japan. The sushi chefs are knowledgeable and don't pack a fist ful of rice in each nigiri and I think it's awesome that they caution patrons to not use the soy sauce. If you're looking to use a piece of nigiri to soak of soy sauce, don't waste your money here! ?Come here to eat fresh fish on perfectly formed rice that just melts in your mouth!

My friends recommended this sushi place. She said.. it's the best sushi place in NYC... then i went to yelp to check out the reviews.. and oh wow.. the reviews are good. So, I went here three weeks ago with two of my friends. We had 730pm reservation on Tuesday. We got there and told that we only have 90 minutes to finish the meal... which is not a big deal. I like the way they do it this way, so people don't have to wait too long for table. We ordered 2 appetizers.. and the omakase... omg.. those are really good. The fish are fresh and we don't need to add anything to it because the chef already put soy souce in it. We only did 10 piece of sushi.. considering we don't want to break the bank. :( With 2 beers, 1 plum wine, 2 appetizers, we spent about $90 per person (including tax and tip). yes, it's expensive.. but totally worth it. ? I will definitely go back here again.. someday.. for a special event like birthday or something.

Sushi Yasuda always held a special place in my heart. ?It is where, about 10 years ago, I *learned* to eat sushi. ?I worked down the block and when my boss would take us out for lunch, he always wanted to go to Yasuda. ?I would order the chicken terayaki and he would force me to try some of his raw fish. ?After a few times I developed an appreciation and craving for it. ?Suddenly, I was getting Yasuda's 3-roll lunch special (back then it was $15) and devouring it. Since then I've been to sushi restaurants around the world and while my last two Yasuda trips weren't as magical as I remembered, I still thought of it fondly. That's over now. ? Maybe it's because Chef Yasuda is gone and so none of the staff cares if the place succeeds or sinks but 5 of my friends and I had a terrible experience at Yasuda. We had a 9:30pm reservation. ?Four of the six had never been to Yasuda before. ?Most of us ordered omakase, 2 people ordered specific pieces and rolls. ?When we got our orders, which were completely mixed up ("just take from his plate" was what our waiter kept saying when we'd point out that he got something totally wrong), the waiter said "ok, this is last call, do you think you'll want anything else?" ?WHAT IS THAT? ?How am I supposed to know if I'd want more when I haven't taken a bite yet? ?The service was a disaster. ?We did all order more and again it arrived haphazardly and incomplete. ?We tried to say something to the server and he just shrugged and said "don't tip." ?I'm not the kind of person to stew and then undertip so I approached the manager who, frankly, could not care less. ?I said they should not have taken a 9:30 reservation and he said "ok". ?OK WHAT, mofo? ?We spent $120 each on this awful experience. ?Was the fish good? ?It was ok but nowhere near worth the price and certainly not worth the crappy service. ? Yasuda is over. ?Sad, but very, very ?true. ? I will absolutely never come back. ?They lost a long-time customer and I don't imagine I'll be the only one. ?It's all about Sasabune now.

Came here for lunch; I think I was expecting more maki (hand rolls) with the creative combination since that has defined "good sushi" in the past. I would describe my meal as excellent simply because it was made with extremely high quality ingredients. I ordered off the pre fixe lunch menu and got sushi--tuna, eel, shrimp--and maki (literally fish, rice, seaweed wrap) with tuna, eel, spanish mackerel and something else (oops, can't remember). And the house salad. The salad was excellent...everything else was simple rice and fish but because it was so fresh it was delicious. The spanish mackerel maki stood out...it was melt-in-your mouth delicious. So I didn't order off the regular menu and would love to go back to do so, but the food I did get was excellent. My only complaint...over-zealous wait staff. They cleared my plates almost immediately after I finished (but hadn't savored the ginger) and way before my friend was finished. And they filled my water up every 2 seconds...felt rushed.

Probably the best quality and most beautifully prepared and presented sushi I have ever had! Don't look for fancy and complicated rolls with catchy names on the menu. This is a place where the art of traditional sushi transforms fish of the highest quality into bite-size morsels of bliss. Go easy with or even put aside the soy sauce and wasabi. This stuff is this good and is best enjoyed naked. The restaurant has a clean zen-like decor dressed in the warmth of bamboo and the staff provides impeccable service. Chef Yasuda and his team are also eager to educate their customers on matters sushi and how to best enjoy it. Best in NYC? Probably. At least I have not tasted any better. As the say in the beer commercial: "It dunn get any better than this!"

I've been a sushi addict for years, but this place taught me what sushi is. ?The fish is as good as it gets and they perfectly treat most of the sushi with wasabi and soy sauce. ?I sat at the bar where the head sushi chef pridefully instructed us when to us soy sauce and when not to, but this place is definitely not pretentious. ? Warning: Don't go here if you want to continue enjoying your local sushi joint. ? Morimoto's sushi has nothing on Sushi Yasuda.

Excellent! Best sushi I've had to date. Impeccably fresh and prepared, none of that goofy cream cheese, heart shaped gimmicky crap. First time we went there was when my wife's lil' sister visited from California. Loved it so much tried to make a reso two days later, but of course they were booked, but called again later in the day and success, a cancellation! And recently just for my wife's birthday we sat at the bar which I highly recommend. It was awesome ordering a few pieces at a time and having your own personal chef making it to order. Peace Passage Oyster, fried rock whole little rock crabs, fried eel bones,uni and four different freshly grilled eels whaa, are you kidding me? Insane! Just a few of the highlights, but everything was incredible. Can't wait for my next visit to NYC.

What makes this place truly great is the superb service. ?If you come often enough to have a favorite chef they'll ask you when you make a reservation who you want to sit in front of. ?The staff is super attentive, almost to the point where you feel them looking over your shoulder...which did happen, but once they saw that we saw them, they eased up a bit...but I guess this is what happens when they assign one server to only two seats. One example of how much they dote on you. ?We ordered the seaweed salad and my friend didn't know what one of them was. ?She asked me in a kind of whisper...I said I dunno...next thing you know the chef who prepared it told us!

Very cool spot for a dinner date, whether it be with a friend, special someone or business meeting. ?Service was great, but kinda felt rushed because an actual time limit was given to us when I made the reservation. ?That's how great this place was...everyone wants a taste of it!

The girlfriend and I walked in after work the other night and luckily it was early enough for us to get a table though we were told it was reserved for in an hour. No biggie, we thought - plenty of time to grab a quick bite. Oh man, do I wish we had more time to linger! ?We started with the grill cod and seaweed salad. The cod was perfectly seared with crispy skin and delicious, flaky, white flesh. The seaweed wasn't the usual stringy kind soaked in rice vinegar but a mix of green, red, and white seaweed served with a sesame sauce. The sauce was kind of a miss but a refreshing change at the same time. The range of sashimi and sushi is far greater than the usual selection at most places and the chef highlights his recommendations for the day. I mean where else do they have something like half a dozen types of yellowtail available? I ordered some toro, yellowtail, and king salmon. I have to say that this was one of the best toros that I've ever had and it ranks up there with Ebisu in SF. The other fish paled in comparison to the toro but were very good in their own right. Some green tea mochi was a nice way to top it off. One of the nice things about Yasuda is the minimalist decor - no frills and they just let the fish speak for itself.

Wow, this place is delicious. Wonderfully fresh fish, I am mostly a non-fish lover and so sort of picky about sushi. I would go back here in a second. The servers were very friendly, I enjoyed the spare decor. The pickled mountain veggies were good, each pickled in something different. ?I thought all of the sushi was excellent, particularly liked the salmon. Went with my parents; wasn't much for my mom (who is not a sushi eater) to eat, so keep that in mind if you have any friends who don't like raw fish when you go here. ?One other odd thing, when my mom made the reservation, they made a point of telling her that if we didn't get there within 10 mins of the resy they would give away the table and if we took more than 1.5h eating they would kick us out. But when we were there everyone was extremely friendly! So perhaps they have just had some issues with people ditching or staying all night that has made them a little touchy.

Don't get me wrong, sushi at this place is really good. ?I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I took away 2 stars because of their service. ?When my sushi arrived I immediately found a small hair on top of my sushi. ?I mentioned this to the waitress and she murmured 'oh.. it must be brush hair.. I am sorry' in a very light tone and took it away to replace. First of all, I didn't like how she tried to make light of the matter by saying that it's the hair fallen from the brush the chef uses. And for the restaurant of this caliber and price point, shouldn't they at the minimum offer a free drink as an apology? ?I mean, I am not going to demand that they do something to make up for such unpleasant experience, but it's always nice to see when a restaurant takes an extra step to make up for their mistake.... even if it was just a free coke.

The over all experience of Sushi Yasuda was really good. ?I ordered the Sashimi platter and the Seaweed appetizer. ?The Seaweed platter was very unique and different. ?The sashimi was awsome, it just melted in my mouth, easily best i've had yet. ?The atmosphere is very serene and the service was excellent. The only thing negative about Sushi Yasuda is that every thing is very price and some what comes in small portions. If you're looking for good price sushi that is good but won't burn a whole in your wallet, this is not really the place for you. ?However, if you can afford it, I would definitely recommend it.

The sushi here was impeccable. I mean, super fresh and tasty. Obviously, you have to go in knowing what you'll be spending, but it's worth it. Walk into the restaurant and you'll be greeted with clean lines, wood decor, and clean wait staff. I know the decor might not be anything special, but I appreciate the simplicity and quality of it. The sushi chefs clearly know what they're doing as do the waiters. We even had a brand-new waiter, who was shadowing a veteran. He could barely speak English, straight from Japan. I got a combination sashimi set and we ordered a few more rolls, including some roe and tuna. You'll walk in here and have a great meal regardless. This is for moderate to true sushi enthusiasts. It's not for people who can't stand eating a piece of fish raw alone. Don't go in here and taint your salmon with cream cheese. Order some pieces of fish and take the chefs' recommendations.

I had high expectations coming here. ?Upon arriving (2 people out of my party of 3) I was expecting having to wait. ?They were kind enough to seat us 10 minutes before our actual reservation. ?I hate when places refuse to seat you when your full party isn't there. ? Started off with their fried matcha ebi. ?I enjoyed the breading (reminded me of japanese rice crackers - osenbe vs your traditional batter/bread crumbs) Opted for the omakase (i think we counted 9 pieces of sushi and 4 individual pieces of maki rolls). ?it was great. pieces are smaller than gari (half the size) but the rice is great and the fish is served at the perfect temperature Ended up getting a few additional pieces. I think I had about 20 pieces in all. ?After tax and tip, we paid $117 a person. ?I loved that the uni was only $5 a piece

Pretty much a "go once just to say you've gone" type of place. Yes, the sushi is superbly fresh and simple and delicious. Yes, it's the best uni I've probably ever had. Not enough to warrant the price though. Staff a little cold, much like the atmosphere. Not really willing to help with the somewhat confusing menu. If I'm spending $200 on a meal, I want it to last more than 45 minutes and not still be hungry. 4 stars for that uni though. Yummmm.

Sushi "snob" here. Lived in Japan. ?Family is Japanese. ?Eat sushi... all. the. time.

Now that we got that outta the way----this place is fantastic. ?Listen to the sushi chefs and eat what they give you and as they tell you to eat it... this place is authentic. ?Sushi is fresh and delicious! ?With Yasuda, I was feeling adventurous because I felt I could trust the sushi chefs to do their thing and impress me (and my taste buds). Absolutely delicious. ?Pricey, but there's a way around it. ?Go for lunch... If you're looking for big portions, my advice would be not to go to authentic sushi restaurants.

Just went back to Sushi Yasuda with my wife as a "goodbye to NYC" meal. Once again it was a divine experience, with perfect sushi rice, exquisite fish, and solid service. The difficulty in getting reservations and their habit of trying to fit in diners for 20-30 minute slots is annoying, but hey, what can you do when the sushi is this good.

There really is nothing bad you could possibly say about the sushi here, it's insanely fresh and flavorful , probably the best I have ever had. With that said its not my type of place, I'm not really into the sushi chef making me one piece at a time, putting my wasabi and soy on it for me and presenting me one piece at a time. But then again, where else can you eat sushi right next to Martha Stewart so how can I bitch!

I will start out by saying this is one of my favorite sushi restaurants and the experience is worth every penny. Not only do they have freshest and most delicious fish, the restaurant's over the top service and contemporary interior with a wonderful tea house aesthetic make for one of the best sushi experiences possible. Yes, if you're in New York and want glamor/glitter, may be there are better places for you to go. I would argue that the experience will not match the intimate Yasuda experience however.

Excellent stuff if you sit in at sushi bar and do the omakase. You can expect excellent service, amazing sushi (very fresh fish and perfect rice..etc), and the chef's personal attentive service. These guys do only traditional, nigiri style sushi so no fancy americanized rolls...etc. Might be a bit hard to get reservations and the host person can be a bit difficult at times.

I love sushi and this was one of the best places. Excellent customer service. Very helpful in figuring out the menu. We spend about 20 minute trying to understand how to make an order on the sheets they gave us, but the waiter didn't rush us and patiently answered all of our questions. Toro, ankimo and miso glazed cod were delicious! All the food arrived on time and was very fresh. Green Tea ice cream for dessert was delicious.

I think after Chef Yasuda left the quality isn't the same anymore. ?They have less fish options. ?The rice was still seasoned well but I don't think they put in as much effort that day. ?My favorite scallop was not on the menu that day and they had regular salmon and tuna but not the other specialty fish. ?Overall still very good though.

It is a Saturday night, the studio has been thumping for hours, and we are ready for ?great meal. Our engineer is one well connected guy. All he has to do is pull out his iphone and within minutes we have a reservation. Not just any reservation but one at a place that so many have been turned away from. Tonight we are off to Sushi Yasuda. The interior immediately takes you away from the cacophony of this city. As we walked through the entrance, a sense of calm overcame all of us. Minimalism is a word that perfectly describes Sushi Yasuda. The use of bamboo here creates a ?luxurious texture for your senses.The owners have gone to great lengths to present one of the best looking restaurants in New York and maybe even one of the best in the US. As we took our seats at the bar, we were handed three different menus. One for sushi and sashimi, one for the cooked specials, and one for the chefs recommendations. Everything looked fantastic. We decided to start off with a yellow tail dish that would be prepared in five separate ways. ?This may be the best dish in the city. It just seem to melt in our mouths. Next up was the Soft shell Crab. and Artic Char. Two dishes are so rich in flavour that our taste buds almost shutdown from over stimulation! For me, the best of the night were yet to hit our table. The Otoro and Sawani were second to none. Warrel and Jeff ordered two more rounds of the Sawani. It really put a smile on the chefs face. LOL. Since my friends like to try new thing when it comes to sushi, I told the chef that we would like something special. Within moments we were graced with Engawa, a very hearty cut of halibut fin, and Gensaba Mackerel. Since we couldn't leave without having dessert, the three of us had the red bean mochi. There is always room for mochi especially red bean! This is one meal that really surpassed my expectations!!

'NO GAMES. NO TRICKS', exclaims Chef Yasuda. Everything is prepared in front of you. I could come here every month. I intend on doing so as this place definitely ranks in my top3, in great company with Sasabune and Masa. Chef Yasuda refuses to be called 'Master', as his humility suggests that he is still a student of sushi making. Chef Yasuda is never short on stories and was conversing with us throughout our entire meal. It was quite enjoyable to see a master of his craft set what he calls 'THE STANDARD'. Many sushi pieces had sea salt or lemon juice over it. I wasn't crazy about the sea salt, but that would be my only qualm. Yasuda also puts soy sauce on the pieces that need it, so you don't have to. The sushi rice though. It truly does trump all others. Yes, including Sakagura's and Donburiya's. Yasuda told me he hasn't been to Sakagura (across the street, lower level) in 5 1/2 years. He prefers to cook at home, wary of all other chefs. I read somewhere that Dassai23 is the sake of choice here but Chef Yasuda doesn't seem to know a lick about sake so he couldn't confirm that.Time limit for dinner at Yasuda's station is 90 minutes. They only hold seats at the sushi bar for 10 minutes, max 4 people. They will call 1 day before the date of to confirm. After dinner, I booked another reservation on the spot a month from today. This is the real deal folks. Nothing gimmicky, nothing fancy. Purists rejoice! My Q&A with Chef Yasuda: -What is considered 'FAKE'? sesame seeds, monkfish liver, inside out rolls, funky rolls, upside down sushi on tongue, chefs who drink on the job -When should sushi be optimally consumed? 3-5 seconds after it hits your plate -Do you hang out with other chefs over dinner? No -Is ginger supposed to be naturally pink? No, it's processed with vinegar and dyes. Baby ginger is supposed to be 'white' -What do you like to eat? Irish food (sausages, etc) -What do you like to cook? Steak -Where do you shop? FreshDirect, Supermarket on 2nd Ave -Is there any good sushi around? No, I don't trust any sushi in America or Tokyo nowadays. Real sushi was in Tokyo back in the 80's -Is it true that all the good shellfish comes from the West Coast? No, it also depends on how the shellfish is prepared -What's in your sushi rice? ?I use 2 kinds of vinegar, rice and red, cane sugar, first harvest rice (2 kinds - short and medium grain from Sacramento). I have had reporters ask me the ingredients I use in my sushi rice and I gladly tell them because they'll never be able to duplicate it. I compare sharing my recipe to watching a kickboxer kick. He can show you how he kicks, but you'll be hard pressed to mimic it. -How long has it been open? 9yrs -When did you start making sushi? I opened an Eel Restaurant in Tokyo when I was 18. After I was a busboy, floater at a Japanese restaurant for 4 1/2 years. -Do you serve fugu? No, fugu should be served at a fugu place. There's a reason why Dentists and Surgeons don't specialize in the same thing. -Share with us a story: two good friends for 23yrs frequent this place for lunch every Wednesday. One orders 40pcs and the other orders 8pcs. They both split the bill evenly. They enjoy each other's company. Good people. -Share with us a philosophy about life: pick something and stick to it, through good times and bad OMAKASE (14pcs + 1 roll) (Noteworthy pieces denoted by an asterisk) -Otoro ($8) *Uni ($5) [Santa Barbara] -King Salmon ($4.50) [New Zealand] -Arctic Char ($4) -Tasmanian Trout ($4) -Shrimp ($4) [grilled to order] *Ika ($4) *Hamachi ($4) -Giant Clam Himo ($4.75) -Hotate ($4) [East Coast] *Peace Passage Oyster ($3.75) -Wild Salmon Roe ($4) -Sawani ($5.50) [fresh white sea eel] -Anago ($5.50) [fresh dark sea eel] *Shirayaki ($5.50) [Canal St, fresh white freshwater eel, grilled to order] -Tekka maki ($7.50/shared) Must try the Saba next time!

And she broke her glass of water. And she cut her arm a bit later. And she didn't miss mum at all to take care for. I think Yasuda's uniqueness is given by the exceptionality of their available items among a few other characteristics. Besides the freshness, quality, the deliciousness, pureness and expertise of all the sushi chef army behind the bar, which includes Mr Yasuda, there is something else in what is said is the best sushi place around the city. And Even though "only" about 50% of the clientele was Asian that night, something that we all think is not a good sign, it doesn't matter here. Yasuda still hit the best and its appreciate by his roots too. And despite the complex system to choose your items, at the end it doesn't really matter as well. We all have preferences but everything will be good at Yasuda. Ask them to explain how it works. Otherwise, if you are new in the joint you can easily be lost. As I was. And I finally confess it to our chef. And he take care of my order and show me how to eat it, what I should taste, waited for my reaction and smiled every single time after what he saw. And as he noticed my obsession for wasabi he start to add a bit more over the pieces. Even though I liked to eat first a virgin bite followed by an overdress in wasabi one. Soy sauce ... forget please. Some of the items are seasonal. Just in summer this fish is catch . Order that. And any piece with the word orange on her name. That citrus kick just made it amazing. And anything that says Scallops. Or clams. Order the clams. And the freshwater-eel. Oh and of course, the uni. Its like fresh butter, sea butter I guess we should say. And despite the fact that I just consider sashimi when I am in a sushi fest, ?I'm glad he order the rolls. Because this, this is also a must order. I loved how warm the rice is, and how fresh the nori is. But try their fish liver too. A small bowl with 4 different textures, colors and liver flavor. And the egg custard. It looks like Natillas*, an egg based Spanish dessert, a delicate glowing yellow custard, but it taste as Gyeran-tang (korean Egg Soup) creamy, comforting and soaked in a flavorful and clean broth once you break the surface layer. Simply but it taste as heaven to me as gyeran tang has been long ago one of my fave dishes. ?The sake list is quite short; 2 dry, 2 mild, 1 nigori and a couple more. But the nigori and mild bottles that we finished was really good. The restaurant is designed as an open space. You don't feel intimacy and it's clean and bright. But you go there for the sushi experience. It was quite embarrassing to break the glass of water. But suddenly I already had the host and the hostess to my left in milliseconds with towels to fix my unhandiness; almost embracing me to rest importance. Are you ok? yes, I am. But it was even worse when later some small piece of glass left in the bench made me an small cut ... very small and already nothing, but you all know what happen when we got a cut right? 2 bandages later and worry looks from everybody erased my blush. Like at home. You are important the rest can be fixed. Despite the cut, the confusion and the bill, the mochi ice cream with green tea powder that we order as dessert did the rest of the work to make a happy sushi night. *http://www.google.com/im¡­

Some bobby-soxer began hounding me three weeks ago, re: taking me out to dinner for my birthday. ?She knows of my fiendish obsession with the uncooked delicacy. Everyday leading up to this past Saturday she would repeatedly remind me about our dinner plans, but wouldn't say where we were going. ?She knows I'm impossible to please and took a big risk in booking reservations here (for fear that I wouldn't think it was great), but with big risks come big rewards. ?We hailed a cab and left the comforts of Gramercy/Murray Hill for the barren wasteland, save car rental places (midtown), for dinner. ?Getting nervous in the cab, she asks, "Do you know where we are going?" I reply, "No." Because like the true tourist that I am, I have no idea about most restaurants in NYC. ?We get out of the cab at 43rd and walk up the street, where my gut started screaming because it initially looked like this dame had booked reservations at an Indian restaurant in no man's land. ?I play it off like, ohh that's so great, Indian food is just what I wanted. We walk closer to the Indian restaurant, she says, "We're here." ?Wait. What? This isn't even a restaurant. There's no sign. Where there should be a sign is just a white background with the black outline of a fish. ?That feeling that I got in the third grade (see Tekserve review) revisits. We sit at the sushi bar. ?She doesn't realize that I know my fair share of sushi culture, nor does she realize that she's opened Pandora's Box in bringing this guy to Sushi Yasuda. ? I lost all restraint and self control. We sat at the bar and I immediately felt the sense of being at home and in the right place for fresh sushi. ?I look at her to inform her that we are going all out tonight, and she smiles without reminding me that she isn't a millionaire. I inform the itamae to keep feeding us whatever he felt was freshest and most appropriate. ?He starts us with the bland American versions of sushi which included (yellowtail, tuna, salmon, etc.) He sees that the broad and I are more serious, and that is when our education and journey began in exploring his delicious offerings. Round after round of fresh fish came out and we pleasantly thanked our chef with each delicious bite. ?He provided helpful facts and masterfully carved some of the finest sushi I've eaten in NYC. ?*Side note: my date is a walking food/restaurant encyclopedia so in the spirit of things I overhear a father and son duo next to us talking and we strike up a conversation. ?The encyclopedia kicks into high gear and starts to dictate restaurants that these two out-of-towners must try, as one of them was hanging on to every vowel she spit out as he feverishly tried to keep pace while entering the names into his iPhone. ?They graciously thank her, and we shared tips, and favorites at the bar. The fish was extraordinary (not the best that I've encountered in NYC, but in the top five). ?The aspect that set this experience apart from others in NYC was the service provided by our portly itamae. ?One could see the years of practice that were etched in his face, and the traces of gray in his hair that outlined his ears. ?A man that truly enjoyed what he did as he worked with a smile, and truly wanted to enrich our experience with brief and necessary commentary. ? My friend's purse was a lot lighter by the end of the night, but her company, thoughtfulness, and reservations to this place made this a truly memorable birthday dinner. ?She will spend the next three months trying to pay off her credit card and consuming the equivalent of ramen, but it was more than worth it for me.

Reservations are a must and you have to confirm the day before but well worth it to sit at the bar for omakase. ?Sea urchin melts on your tongue like gelatinous msg while the salmon roe burst into briney fireworks in your mouth. Try the white king salmon if they have it for a buttery surprise and the oysters are a creamy slime sensation. Perfect for a special night out but come with heavy pockets and prepared for the potential need to eat again later.

I went out to new york for business and I knew i wanted to find a sushi place, and being from california i think I have higher tastes in sushi than most since the fish is so fresh out here. I wanted to find the highest rated sushi place in new york and it lead me to sushi yasuda. The one thing that really stood out on the menu, when i checked online, was that it didnt have any "fluffy" rolls on their menu they just seemed to have straight fish and maybe a piece of cucumber or avocado, which I took as a good sign they would have good quality. When i called to make my resv, two weeks in advance, they only had one time open and it was at like 630pm to i snatched it up looking forward to great sushi...they also gave me a conformation number and I knew his place was legit. The only problem with this place, if any, was that it was a pain in the butt to find, its hidden, and along with the rain it was a real challange...but well worth it. When we got there it was like being back in japan and a really traditional sushi place where you know that the fish quality is going to be stellar and they will tell you when you get to use soy sauce :). I sat down with my friend and we decided to order off the menu, but next time I go back ill make sure to do omakaze and let the chef choose for me. The one thing that was great is that not only did they have fresh fish, but they had about 3-5 different variations of the same fish...each better, but more expensive, than the next. We tried a bit of everything from the tuna, yellow tail, snapper, and eel. This place is for those who really are for true sushi lovers, there is no california, crunchy, philly or any other rolls that take away from the real quality of the fish. This place truly tries to impress you with the fish quality and they exceeded any expectation i had for it. Again, it really is like being back in japan. Two last things: first, thing though MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A RESERVATION!!! or you will be waiting outside to eat here on another day!!! and secondly, make sure you bring $$$$ this place is good but overpriced, the same quality of fish can be found elsewhere for half the price...no one should be charging 5 dollars for 1 piece of negiri sushi...that way to much. But all in all it was a great night, great food, and I will go back next time i'm in new york.

Sushi Yasuda is a sushi purists' dream: incredibly fresh fish with minimal adornments--only those highlighting the inherent beauty of the sea's bounty ever take a place atop/inside each carefully crafted gem. ?The dining room itself is bamboo ceiling-to-table-to-floor, a quiet study of understated elegance in substance--symbolic of the culinary delights and Chef Yasuda, himself. My dining companion and I have been blown away by the impeccably pristine quality (a double emphasis that is well-deserved) and minimalist approach. ?Add to it, Chef Yasuda offers a wide selection of choices from which to have your taste buds tantalized. As with quality produce, the best sushi selections will depend on the seasonality and availability of fish/non-fish items. ?It goes without saying to get the maximum experience, it is best to focus on Chef Yasuda's suggestions (marked on the menu in red ink) or ask him directly if you have the pleasure of dining in front of him at the sushi bar. His NON-FISH items that have profoundly left an impression on us: - Uni: The most sweet, nutty, and intricately-flavored urchin roe we have ever had--a pinch of salt crystals on top added the final touch for a tongue-gasm. - Peace Passage Oyster: The intense taste-fragrance and first notes transported us to the ocean. ?We normally order small and lacy oysters at raw bars, so we were surprised how such large and plump ones appealed so perfectly to our tastes. ?Also revelatory was the final note of flavor: both of us felt a gentle taste of palate-cleansing wasabi. - Mirugai Himo (meat from inside the giant clam's shell): Similar to the oyster but a bit milder and crisper in texture, I preferred this one to the oyster--the opposite for my oyster connoisseur dining companion who is more seasoned in appreciating the intense aromas of raw bivalves. - Three Eels (Dark Anago, White Anago, Dark Unagi): All three had distinct textures and tastes, each freshly made to order--blanched then grilled on eel grills. ?If you never had sea eel, you must try the anago--its texture and natural sweetness are unbelievable. ?The extra care and variations in preparation made it a joy to eat truly fresh eel, since unagi in most sushi places has a chemical taste found in freshwater fish like catfish and tilapia. - Ika: The truly masterful preparation was alone worth it. Chef Yasuda deftly scored the squid at an angle, then cross slitted in two more directions. ?Not only for show, this made the texture incredibly smooth and without the need for unpleasant fiber-gnawing. ?Perfection came with bits of salt on top that added a crunch to the truly tender squid. The FISH that have totally impressed us: - Sardine from Chef Yasuda's hometown of Chiba: This is the most flavor-intense fish we have ever enjoyed. ?The texture is incredibly smooth and naturally high oil-content a dream. - Gensaba: Like the sardine, this mackerel has intense flavor but a firmer texture. - Tail Toro: Truly sublime and flavorful! ?If available, an absolute must for the toro-lover. - Ivory King Salmon: Thanks to another friend wanting to order salmon sushi in our first visit, we were able to explore a fish we usually doid not order. ?Boy, were we ever glad that we did--the most luxurious icing on the proverbial sushi cake! One overall tip: While I do enjoy some sashimi, I recommend going nigiri whenever possible at Sushi Yasuda. Sushi Yasuda and Sushi Sono are the two sushi restaurants I recommend passionately and unequivocally. ?Even if both were equidistant from home, I would go to both equally because they are very complementary and have very little overlap among what we enjoy at each respective location. ?I favor Sushi Yasuda for its incredible non-fish nigiri and specialty fish nigiri; I favor Sushi Sono for fish specials, sashimi and nigiri of whole fish, special soups, and cooked array of seafood items.

(I am sushi man. ?I review sushi.) 1. ?It's the Big Famous Sushi Place. ?But honestly, it's pretty normal. ?The guys who work here probably think the same thing. ?"Why are we such a big deal?" ?Honestly I don't know. 2. The maitre d' is pretty rude. ?He likes to be rude. ?blech. ?His job is to be strict, but you can be strict and polite. ?Waiters are perfectly polite. ?Of course, all staff are Japanese. 3. we sat at bar for lunch. ?Chef was surprisingly kind and patient with foreigners. ?I really didn't expect that. ?He was excellent. ?Even put up with our goofy ordering. 4. Nigiri is very traditional, high-end: small and rounded, often with soy sauce or other seasoning applied by the chef. ?Fish is pretty great, of course; uni was topped with an intense soy (plus something) sauce and was amazing. ?Menu is perfectly traditional: no avocado, no mayo, none of that crap. 5. rolls (yes, rolls...shame on me) are done with supercrisp nori, straight from the chef's hand to your mouth. ?Perfect. ?Getting the crunch of nori is one of the great pleasures of sitting at the bar, and you should do that here. 6. lunch here is actually really cheap if you do the...wait for it...CHECK THE BOX LUNCH SET!!!!!! ? Incredible! ?So yeah, for lunch at least this place doesn't take itself too seriously, cuz they hand out a little scorecard and you can choose 12 pieces for $36 bucks! ?Or something like that. ?Plus half a rolls. ?AMAZING CRAZY VALUE. ?I was almost embarrassed. 7. restaurant is in midtown near the UN, but still there wasn't a single Japanese diner in the place for lunch. ?But clientele were nice, quiet businesspeople. ?No complaints. conclusion: amazing lunch value, and I can't recommend it highly enough. ?That said, this place should be taken off its pedestal. ?I doubt it ever belonged on one. ?This place is highly approachable, so long as you have a reservation.

We recently had the pleasure of dining at Yasuda and it was everything that we had hoped it to be. Everything was perfect. The company, the ambiance, the sake, the sushi/sashimi... Service very professional and efficient (to get us out the door at agreed hour). We tried lots of fish we cannot get out of town. Of course the portions are small but traditionally Japanese which is why we love it! And the sticker shock was pretty minimal and happily remitted. They make it look so easy it is easy to forget not everyone is this good.

Don't bother. ?I totally agree with Joel M. ?This restaurant just doesn't get it. ?The staff are so obnoxious and pretentious, and have some stupid rules, like you cannot combine this with that sushi etc. ?Bull. ?I have to say also that the general clientele kind of go with the pretentiousness of the restaurant. ?I have no idea why this place is still in business. ?Definitely not for people who want to enjoy the authentic sushi with genuine service.

NYC #9 (love cheesecake, you have to read my nxt review!) 3.75 As Day 2 rolls by, I get a note via YELP from a fellow YELPER giving me input on what i should eat.. He says, "Sushi Yasuda..." I'm thinking, hm, Japanese food, can't go wrong ... I can eat Japanese food all day, all night... So before I make it out to Sushi Yasuda, I was chilling with my friend for a few hours few blocks down, when his friend asked me what i was having for dinner that night. ?Here goes the convo below... His friend, aka G: Sushi Yasuda? o shit, i've been meaning to try this place for super long. me: *eyes perk up* oh really? is it THAT good? G: omg, yes! everyone in NY knows about it .. it's probably one of the tops. me: you promise? not none of those hypes right? lol G: yeup. i've tried going but something always came up.. can i go instead? ahhah, but yea, it's definitely going to be my next place to eat. me: YAY... ok, cool. so i walk in super excited. place doesn't feel super japanesey or nothing, lots of cheap wooden furniture throughout. pretty spacious and clean. menu -- the prices are actually quite reasonable, pretty cheap. roughly $3 and up. we both decided to order their prix fixe menu ($20.50/person). There are others you can choose from but we opted for their Sushi & Sashimi combination which is basically 4 pieces of sushi & 1 roll & 3 varieties of sashimi. They were fresh but not like OMG!!! ?both of us wanted to go omakase style, giving the chef the choice to surprise us. was i ever wrong, i personally felt that my money was given more so to charity ... seriously ... i was probably given the cheapest sushi ever alive. adding dessert on top of your prix fixe, it's only $2 more, and they give you this one chunk of mochi (we chose green tea) but for $2? you gotta shoot me in the brain before i realize it was you who shot me. service -- it wasn't good or bad. funny thing is, we noticed how the asians were given the "fobby servers" with the broken accent and the other guys were given the servers who spoke one notch up which was quite amusing. for $80, i'd have gone someplace else but it was only $80, so i guess i'm not really that bitter. but yea, overall, i wasn't blown away or nothing. whether i will come back or not, THAT is the question~* i'm just teasing you.

Is Sushi Yasuda a religious experience? No; for a religious experience, try sashimi in tsujiki market. Sushi Yasuda nevertheless serves the best sushi in the city. The restaurant itself is a practice of minimalism; in this bamboo box, your senses can concentrate on the nigiri and sashimi. Unlike Sushi of Gari and Sushi Seki, enough space between tables allows you to enjoy a brief respite from the bustle of midtown. And the food: the first bite will unleash your innter gastronome; indeed, savor the hedonistic time, as it ends all too quickly when the bill arrives.

This review is not about the food. I made a reservation in one month advance and when I get there I've been told they didn't have my reservation. The front desk guy asked me for the reservation number. I told him the guy took down my reservation didn't give me a number and he didn't believe me and thought I've messed up Yasuda with other restaurant. while I insisted i did made a booking the guy just asked me to get out and don't come back again. How rude is this!!! Is this an appropriate way to treat a customer? Even if you became so much popular this doesn't mean you never make a mistake. It is so obviously that the guy who took my reservation down had no idea about the procedure and just wrote my name and number down on some random sheet so the system didn't record my reservation. I'm pretty sure it is Yasuda that I called to. It can't be other restaurant since I don't have other restaurant called me in one day advanced to confirm booking. I should noticed Yasuda didn't ?call me either. Just beware of the front desk guy. He really disgusted me. And remember the number!

Is this place the best sushi I have ever eaten? I dunno about that. But it might go like this, I have never had sushi in Japan- I like my fish buttery and fatty, and my rice a bit moist and vinegary , and though the fish here are flown from all over the world, like Greece and Spain, the selections of fatty fish were few for that night's matsu menu. The nigiri quality to me is like a 3 stars, its good but I wouldn't eat at 930pm for it again. But sushi is far more about the art isn't it folks? If you sat at the table, and ate the sushi here, you would definitely find it more then less memorable, but again I want to stress on the journey rather then the actual meal itself for a place like this, because really how can you mess up on sushi? it's raw fish placed on rice! Unless you went to an American Grocery store (Whole foods) or Korean owned joint, it is expected that the sushi will be good from a Japanese joint! Sitting at the bar and having the sushi chef ?recommend us what type of fish to get was quite an experience. He taught us that wasabi should never be mixed with soy and how it should be place on the fish and be eaten, how soy is for light dipping only, and nigiri should ?never be fulled immersed in the soy, you loose the flavor of the fish. I was also able to eat with my hands, and that was fun too! The wasabi was fresh, and you can taste the grated root, and it was sweet, not a mind blowing sinus clearing wasabi that I am used to, and kind of fond with. ?The best nigiri of the night for me came from Spain, I think it was a Spanish fish of some sort, it was delicious and buttery. I need to remind myself I have never been a fan of octopus. My friend Joe ordered it and it was just to me, a rubbery piece of something, but apparently it is never frozen and cooked there, unlike some place, said the Sushi Chef. Now what I really enjoyed was the Saki, the warm Saki was amazing, it was sweet and warm, and left no alcoholy taste at all, it was very clean. What you should skip is drinking coke at a sushi place. I think for this is the ultimate punishment for them to their customers. I mean really? My eating companion who I will call Joe ordered 3 cokes, that came out in tiny old school cola bottles, cute ey? Yeah for 4 bucks a pop it wasn't so cute. What does this mean? I think they are pretty much saying, dude don't drink soda with good sushi.. Message Received!! Come for the intimate experience with the Sushi Chefs leave learning a bit more about the Japanese Sushi Culture! ? 4 stars for a great fun experience at the Sushi Bar 3 stars for overall food ( it was good but not my best sushi.. the best? surprising Taka in Atlanta!) of all places..

Took my picky Mom to lunch at Yasuda. We sat at the counter and ordered omakase. They have the freshest fish and the best suhi rice! The portions were small, but we had plenty to fill our tummies. The sushi chef was very attentive to our needs...it was great to communicate directly with the chef without the waitstaff involved. It was fun to watch the sushi chef make our lunch as we ordered one thing after another. A bit pricey for the small portions, but they were perfectly bite sized, and mmmm mmmm delicious. ?The best sushi I've had outside of Japan.

Prob the best sushi and rice I've had in a longgggg time. The place is spacious and you don't feel like you are sitting ontop of other people. Perhaps the back left area could have the same atmosphere as the front tables it would be better or if they could see the sushi bar in general. The bathroom is a painful bright highlighter green you wouldn't except from the calming decorations, wood, and etc that it was decked out in. Service was good but didn't seem like a high end sushi place. They didn't explain the menu that well and just had no introduction or etc. The food came out fast, but it wasn't a long drawn out date place, or somehere you could really hang out and enjoy your food and time. Japanese style just come, order, eat etc..not so much of a food experience. We got the monk fish appeitizer and it was done well..not mindblowing great...but good portion, fried perfectly, and enough meat/sauce. We then ordered the chirashi boxes for both of us. They came out on a bed of rice with seaweed between the rice and sashimi. This was one of the first times ive seen my roome (i took her here for her bday) eat rice..and we almost finished all the rice since it was well cooked, seasoned, and just amazing. The ginger here was also good...the fish was def high enough quality that you forget about your soy sauce since you just are enjoying it so much. The uni was really good! I LOVEEDDD the tuna, toro, and one of the white fishes. ?The pieces were perfect small sizes and melt in your mouth goodness. The salmon was good, and the fish eggs were even eaten though I normally don't eat them. We got the mochi ice cream with redbean and green tea. One melted super fast (redbean) while the green tea was actually frozen and could eat it without putting the entire half in my mouth.

only go if you are a sushi purist. as it has been a personal mission of mine to visit all of the 26s, 27s and 28s on zagat's top food ratings, with sushi yasuda consistently receiving a 28, it was only a matter of time before i sat my scrawny rednecked behiney in their spartan digs. my experience was just a bit awkward. very quiet ambience, and not in a good way. ?communication with our server was strained (language barrier or mere lack of social skill?) to the point that we decided just to skip wine rather than tackle the topic. while i guess you could say we enjoyed our meal, we struggled to appreciate the experience. ?by dining at sushi yasuda, you are essentially agreeing to pay through the nose for impeccably trimmed fresh raw goodies from the sea that will likely be unappreciated by the non-native-japanese palate. ?therfore, if spider rolls are your bag, you are probably in the wrong place but may still be intrigued. ?if your idea of sushi includes cream cheese in your roll, then do yourself a favor and skip SY altogether!

Hands down the best sushi I've had in NYC. ?The only other sushi I've had comparable was in Saigon, where the fish was ridiculously fresh, but Yasuda's preparation is still superior Here's what to do: 1) Don't use the wasabi. It's already mixed in with the rice. As is the soy sauce. The sushi pieces come ready to eat, the fish is also fresh enough where soy sauce isn't really required, but if you like your fish a little saltier, feel free to use it, though that makes you a dumb cracka. 2) Also, take advantage of the daily recommendation, the waitress will mark the a la carte menu, or it will be highlighted in red, those are the freshest cuts of the day. Order up on it. 3) Yasuda also has sushi offerings not found elsewhere. the Artic Char for instance: which is listed under the section for Salmon in the a la carte menu but tastes superior to any Salmon I've ever had. Definitely eat that shit. Do it. 4) I also found the oyster and giant clams amazingly fresh, they retained the salt water flavor and sandy texture from the sea, which may taste strange for the uninitiated but I dug it. The urchin was also top notch and had a smooth labia texture. . 5) If you know what you want, I would avoid the expensive combo dinners and just order a la carte. You won't get the variety but you'll get more of the good stuff. ?I would avoid red tuna and the rolls, which is the cheap stuff they load up on you when you order the combos. Why anyone orders boring bland ass red tuna is beyond me. Tuna cheeks however are decent. 6) I also had some of the flash fried crustaceans, the shrimp I remember was very decent, but not spectacular, put those $$ on the sushi. 7) Last tip, sit by the bar, especially if you wanna do the a la carte thing. Order straight from the chefs. He (they are never woman, despite what you saw on Old Boy) will give you tips on the best pieces, will even tell you where it came from, and why it tastes different, plus he looks like a bad ass samurai. ?You'll have to put up with conversations on either side of you which could be entertaining or just boring. ?On my right, I had a fifty year old writer with a twenty year old girlfriend who kept bumping her elbow into me. ?He had his arm around her back the whole time while she fidgeted uncomfortably. Some college professor fully leveraging his status on the young girl. It was like Woody Allen in Manhattan. Fucking lucky pervert bastard. On our left were two Asian girls who were talking shit about their friends. I tried tuning most of it out but caught the following line: "He's so good looking, and she's really not, I wonder why he's with her." ?With friends like these.... Catty bitches. Also, others have complained about the waiter service being rude. Fuck service. It's the sushi stoopid.

I can't stop thinking about how GOOD the sushi and sashimi were at Sushi Yasuda. Yes, super fresh raw fish and excellent dining experience. We first stopped by at lunch time without a reservation and we were turned away. But just peeking in, I could tell immediately this Japanese restaurant is different and my curiosity was PEAKED. The calm interior expressed sense of class and quality all around. After eating lunch across the street, we came back and made dinner reservations for that evening. They asked us if we had a preference for a particular sushi chef but being that it was our first time we asked for any open tables. We got a 9:15pm reservation at the sushi bar. This is apparently the place to be to see the sushi chefs work their magic with the fish. I can't even express how good the sushi was. OMG. OMG! Seriously, I wanted to cry because it was sooooo delicious. It literally melted in my mouth. No joke. And you know what I mean when there are tears involved when it comes to food. Seriously, good. I was concerned about the service after reading some of the Yelp reviews but our experience was quite contrary! We were seated with much grace at the bar, our server came promptly with the menu and wash clothes... Our service was so attentive I was actually a bit surprised! I had even told my fiance on our way ?to the restaurant, "So, just be forewarned... I heard the service isn't as great as the food..." Well, I take that back. So, back to the sushi. I wish I could remember our sushi chef's name so I could recommend him to you but I'm sure they are all excellent. Yes, loved the banana leaf "plate" for our sushi and explaining the different choices that we ordered. We shared so much our food our chef cut the small morsels into two for us sometimes. Sushi Yasuda may just have raised the bar for good sushi for me... I might never be the same again! (Olive O, thanks for suggesting this place!!!)

Bottom line: (1) Highly personalized (but not suffocating) service; (2) sushi that is unique and distinct; (3) pricey but recommended; (4) sit at the bar. If you've never had quality sushi, this will be an eye opener (a la Le Bernadin and seafood). Quick logistical tip: The host is a bitch, try to be on time. Misogynistic as it may sound, he's a petty, condescending person who unfortunately, takes your reservation. Unless you want to taste murderous rage before sushi, come on time. Rating policy: There are thousands of foodies in NYC, and I defer to them when it comes to rating restaurants and writing reviews. I tend to give 2s and 3s, only because I review places to warn others not to go. For other amazing restaurants (La Sirene, Graffiti), there are thousands of other 4/5-star reviews from more qualified, more patient, and more descriptive writers. In short, my value add to the community is when I'm negative and critical of something. On the other hand, when something is unique, I can't help but speak up. For the most part, I'll try to shut up and not add yet another 5 to Per Se. Details: For the first time in my life, I really enjoyed eating sushi. Let me be very clear: I eat a lot of sushi on a weekly basis. I seamless it in from Haru, Takesushi, or any other joint my bosses prefer. I eat out with friends at Japanese-run sushi bars, Korean-run sushi bars, and when I'm desperate, Chinese-run sushi bars. All told, I've only been able to gauge really bad, really fishy-tasting, and chewy. I pretend I can taste the difference between one fish and another when I eat out with girlfriend, but honestly, most of what I catch is wasabi, vinegar, rice, and "fish" taste. Sushi Yasuda offered a complete dining experience. When you sit at the bar, the chef introduces and individually tailors each piece to you. With each piece of the omakase, the temperature and balance of rice and meat would vary. You felt comfortable in a fairly traditional place. My girlfriend's Japanese and sometimes when we eat out at Japanese places, I feel left out (like that bad kind of they're-up-to-something left out). My personal, confusing racism aside, I felt welcomed by the chefs here. The ingredients were fresh enough that you could tell it was different (e.g., there wasn't that "fishy", chewy quality you find in almost every sushi bar). The rice was amazing and characteristically, understated. I'm typing in this review after just eating a salmon sashimi from another restaurant (I'm a corporate drone and this is how I take a break for dinner), and I have that that acidic, mushy rice aftertaste in my mouth due to bad rice. Our chef was someone you immediately respect. You could see he gave a damn about his food. Even in halting English, he took pains to explain where the sushi was sourced, why he prepared in the way it did (e.g., this shrimp will taste different after 15 minutes, eat it now), and whether or not you liked it. When you like or dislike something, you can read it off his face expressions. In sum, you were eating at a place that clearly respected and took pride in what it served. Service was quiet, understated, and efficient. The chefs were the centerpiece in all of this, and you ate food that was, and indeed tasted, passionate. A quick fun fact is how different the chefs are from the host. In fact, it's really fun to observe the host. While we were waiting for our table, a hapless German came in and asked if he could eat here, to which bitch host replied no. Undeterred, the German asked for a recommendation, at which point, bitch host put on a close-mouthed smile and told said German how could a host, who works 7 days a week with no capacity to eat out anywhere, recommend anything. In almost maudlin fashion, you could see this host relish in the power dynamic and make the other person feel stupid and silly.

Sushi lovers if you can't get a table at Nobu then forget about it and try Sushi Yasuda! Fresh fish and delicious food. I highly recommend the white salmon sushi and any of the special daily appetizers. Also, the $20.50 pre-fixe dinner is a great deal. It includes a combo of sushi, sashimi and rolls.

Eeeeee? Why didn't I review this last year? ?Well I went back again last month and it was as good as ever. ?MUST TRY THE TASMANIAN TROUT! ?If you sit in front of Yasuda-san ya better: 1) not use soy sauce or wasabi, 2) eat thy sushi within 10 sec. served, 3) eat the sushi in one shot, and 4) not dislike farmed fish. ?Oh yeah, we had a long discussion about this. But it's all good, the sushi there is so worth it (even if sometimes Y-san can be lecture-y).

There are 2 kinds of sushi in the world: sushi that is, well, just food, and Sushi, which is art in the form of food. Sushi Yasuda is a perfect example of the latter. My girlfriend and I were in New York and we wanted to go somewhere we could get something that was unavailable to us where we live in DC. Naturally, the first thing I do is consult Yelp! to see what the creme de la creme of Sushi spots is in the city. I thought Nobu would be #1, but with something like 250 reviews, all averaging 4.5 stars, came Sushi Yasuda. First off, let's talk about first impressions. Generally speaking, when you see a restaurant that is represented by simply a logo, in this case, a fish that looks like it's a fingerprint, you know the place is either a) ridiculously badass, or b) thinks it is without good reason. Yasuda is an example of the former. You walk in and there is plenty of light, bleached wood everywhere. It's a rich, warm, but clean and simple decor that really appeals to the eye. Upon sitting at the sushi bar (it's the only place we could sit and we STILL had to wait til 915 to get a reservation), we are immediately greeted by a friendly gentleman whom I come to find out is Chef Yasuda himself. I suspected it, simply by the way he behaved behind the bar - natural, friendly, and hospitable. It's like we were guests in his home. He was educating us, making recommendations, cracking jokes. All in all, a fantastic host. To his left were 4 other sushi chefs, each commanding about 4 seats at the large sushi bar. Ours was very attentive, and seemed to always hear me when I said, "hmm, wonder if i should try that." he'd immediately ask if I wanted to or not. Good for business. We started with the sushi meal that consisted of 12 pieces of sushi, and a 1/2 roll each. This was the recommendation of Chef Yasuda. We went through the motions: tuna (at least 5 kinds I could count), salmon (4 kinds here), yellowtail, trout, shrimp, eal (5 kinds here, too). Each and every piece was crafted so delicately and flavored so perfectly that you didn't need shoyu (Japanese for soy) sauce, or wasabi on your own. In fact, they didn't even give me the option to add wasabi. I can imagine that doing so would be offensive to them. After our sampling plate, which the sushi chef prepared for us piece by piece, forcing us to wait a few minutes in between pieces to really savor the flavors (also helpful on your wallet to have a meal paced for you by the preparer...), we started to venture out of our typical tuna, salmon, yellowtail, eel box and into some other things. The a la carte menu at Yasuda comes chalk full of red ink, which the attentive server (so attentive that she stood behind us the entire time we were dining) told us was the markings of the Chef, recommending which pieces were particularly stellar that evening. The lady had octopus, we both tried arctic char (our descriptor for said fish was - "bouncy," no offense, Chef Yasuda). The jovial owner proudly pointed out that he had Sockeye Salmon from Alaska, which is only available 2 weeks/year - it was a very different flavor from "regular tuna," and bright bright orange. Of the salmon we had, it was certainly my favorite. We tried the rumored-to-be-close-to-endangered Fatty Blue Fin Tuna, which apparently got me a dirty look from the woman next to us. No wonder the stuff is disappearing, it's so amazing that it literally melts in your mouth. Literally. No joke. The best part of my meal came towards the end as I started to venture into my favorite category: eel. Yasuda stocked 5 different kinds that night and I was able to try various types. My favorite: White Freshwater Eel, which was garnished with fresh rock sea salt and a splash of lemon juice just after being slightly charred over an open flame. The resulting flavor was a combination of smoke and citrus that I doubt I'll ever experience again (until I go back to Yasuda, next I'm in NYC). It was at this point that the g/f threw in the towel and I said, "almost..." The sushi here was so good that I was willing to order two pieces I generally find disgusting: Salmon Roe and Sea Urchin. For those of you who don't know, Sea Urchin looks like a combination of wet sand and brains blended together and scooped onto a bed of rice. It also happens to be the gonad of sea urchin...yes, gonads. The thought of eating this, combined with its appearance and texture usually makes me want to gag, but in the ultimate sign of Yasuda's magnificence, I put my trust in him and ordered it. The result was a flavor that was unparalleled to any other - the chef carefully seasoned both the Salmon Roe and Uni (Urchin) with a dash of lemon and some rock grain salt and I devoured both pieces. They were just fantastic. I've never had lemon on my sushi before, but it really brought out the flavor fo the fish nicely. Lastly, if you go here, make sure you sit at hte sushi bar and WATCH Chef Yasuda - he's masterful with a sushi knife. A true artist.

I love this place. It reminds me of my visits to Tokyo. I remember I brought my bf here for his birthday and we had a great time. Service in most Japanese restaurants are extremely attentive, because of the culture so thats never a worry. The atmosphere was very open with bamboo walls, light decor and the seating was intimate. Everything we ordered was top-notch. I really loved the green tea prawns. Unfortunately we weren't sitting at the bar which are front row seats to Chef Yasuda's amazing creations.

My GF and I found a great deal to NY and planned out a 5 restaurants in 3.5 day trip. Starting off our eating trip, we planned to give Sushi Yasuda a shot. Coming from LA, I thought, why try Japanese food in NY? We have more than enough Sushi Spots in LA that I can try. But reading reviews here and on http://ChuckEats.com (thanks for the blog recommendation Nick!) I had to give NY sushi a try. And it was just as I expected from all that I have read. We arrived promptly at our reservation time, which was just as they were opening the door for lunch. Our reservations had us at the sushi bar and we had to be sure to be out by a certain time. As we sat down, we had a Ti leaf put in front of us by the Chef (which we later find out is Yasuda-san himself) and were given a hot wet towel to wipe our hands. Being virgins to this "authentic" sushi eating we were worried about 'offending' anyone. I read up on all the rules on the web site and felt fairly confident that I would not be yelled at. Looking at the menu, we decided to go with one of the Sushi/Sashimi and one of the Sushi/roll combo's. Looking back I think I would have been better off with an omakase lunch, but I don't believe my GF would have been able to handle some of the items. She ordered the Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Halibut, Striped Bass sushi, and had a roll of Tuna and a roll of Kaiwane with her combo. I tried to be a little more adventurous but it all ended up being quite standard (this is where the ala carte comes in). I ordered a Halibut, some white fish, and Tuna for my sashimi dishes and for my sushi (which ended up being fairly monotone white/grey) I had a Scallop, Yellowtail, Arctic Char, and a Clam. We start off the service with a beautiful bowl of miso soup served piping hot. Next came my three sashimi's which were placed on my Ti leaf along with shreded daikon and real wasabi (not that horseradish shit that we are all used to). Not following the rules, I started to make my mixture of Sho-yu and Wasabi but was stopped by Yasuda-san before I tarnished one of the beautiful cuts of fish. His way was to take a little wasabi and place it on the fish directly before touching it to the Sho-yu. Everything was absolutely delicious and tender. Next, on came the Sushi's. Now, eating his sushi, you are not allowed to dip it in sho-yu, the procedure is to add a little wasabi if you want and pop it into your mouth. Yasuda-san rubs the perfect amount of Sho-yu to go with his sushi. Oh, and his rice. Perfect! I think it was the perfect amount of rice, and the flavor: sweet with a touch of vinegar. The whole meal was absolutely delicious, but I wasn't full yet and I was becoming jealous of the pair next to me who were getting an omakase. I decided to add on a few more sushi. The pair got a trio that included Sea Snail and Albacore, and knew that I will try my hand at those. The Sea Snail was ... different. There was definitely a grainyness and unique, 'bug-like' taste. Interesting, but I would never order it again. The albacore was much better and I still wasn't too full (it was okay though since I had to save room for the next restaurant anyways). So to end the experience, I decided to end with a Ikura. It was a good ending, but nothing too special since I've had very fresh eggs straight out of a king salmon before, but still good, especially combined with the perfectly cooked rice. Overall, it was the best sushi experiences i've ever had. Just watching Yasuda-san at work was worth the price of the meal. Oh, and I love the pair that sat down a few seats over as we were leaving, "Do you have spicy tuna? No, oh okay. How about California rolls?" The baffled look by Yasuda-san was a perfect ending to the meal.

Yasuda should thanks Yelp for having the minimum rating as one star! This is a horrible place in all means and I would have given no starts if it was possible . We went there for my bday first time and will NEVER come back again!!! If you don't have an ?MD in sushi DO NOT GO THERE or you be disappointed /surprised what ?"real" sushi is all about . We eat in a lot of sushi restaurants all over and we cannot enjoy the taste of Wasabi , i myself can't eat spicy ?. We got the sushi rolls and I almost cried when I ?found out in my mouth a strong taste of Wasabi . It was not written in the menu that it is either spicy or contains Wasabi ! They also do not serve spicy mayo (which my husband really like ) . I mean come on Yasuda , get real ! You are in the USA , not in japan ! Why are they banding the poor spicy mayo ??? Also the environment there is like cemetery . No music and if your cell phone happens to ring don't be surprise u'll get "the look" from one of the customers . I am glad they let you breathe. If you do decide to go there , don't forget a magnifying glass so u can see the dishes (to those that didn't get it - the portions are ridiculously small ) . We actually didn't eat much cause we decided to get the check and leave to eat somewhere else so we won't be left hungry. The waitress offered us something else instead but we were too disappointed already . We were shocked that we got a full check even though we haven't eaten really . So my husband went to talk with the manager and got a rude ?hint that we do not know about how real sushi supposed to be ! Well dear manger we are really sorry that we don't get real sushi but we do get that your service is one of the worst we had and u should have think whatever u think but just let us get out of there with a smile or at least with respect for you and the restaurant . Finally he took off ?the "wasabi " rolls from the bill but after a good 7 minuets of arguing with us . Terrible !! When we told him that it wasn't mentioned in the menu that the rolls are spicy or with Wasabi he said it is in the last page of the menu in fine print ( which we didn't bother to look since WE WEREN'T BUYING A HOUSE . We went that evening to a sushi place named BONDST which was wonderful ! Service , environment ?and food were just perfect. So I would say that Yasuda is way , way overrated !!!!

The minute you walk into the restaurant, you can immediately decipher from the feel of the place that Chef Yasuda is a traditionalist and is dedicated to sticking true to the art of making sushi. The restaurant is airy and light, outfitted with bamboo walls, tables and ceiling. ?The minimalist d¨¦cor insinuates that the food and sushi are the focus here - Sushi samba it is not. ?There's no loud music, ?no gimmicky rolls with exotic ingredients - everything is fresh and above all, simple. ?The way Chef Yasuda prepares his sushi is to highlight the flavors of the fish - not to mask them. There is even a note in the menu that the Chef recommends using soy sauce, wasabi and accompaniments very sparingly as not to disguise the flavors of the fish. Since this was a work lunch, our group of 4 was promptly seated at a table. ?I really wanted to and would recommend to anyone going here to sit at the bar. ? There's something humbling and intriguing about watching Chef Yasuda work - he's so delicate and diligent and efficient with the sushi - it's quite mesmerizing. As we settled in, we were given 2 menus: 1) ?A sheet of paper highlighting the sushi and sashimi available for the day, with Chef Yasuda's recommendations circled in red. ?The sheer variety of fish is outstanding ; it can be slightly overwhelming even to a non-beginner. ?Next to each fish is a box where you input the number of orders you want. ?Our waitress indicated that for one person - One roll and at least 5 varieties of the sushi/sashimi were recommended. 2) The second menu contained the drinks, appetizers, prix-fixe choices and various other items Our group opted for the prix-fixe, which included a soup/salad, chef's choice of sashimi, and a choice of a roll and four different types sushi/sashimi. ?The fish tasted EXTREMELY fresh and delicate - the pieces almost melt in your mouth. ?You can tell there was care in the preparation of the food. I even could distinctly tell the rice was different - it was very delicately seasoned and cooked perfectly. ?I read in an interview somewhere that Yasuda uses two different grains of rice and that careful attention is paid to make sure that the exact proportion of rice is used in relation to the fish. Overall, I have to say this was probably the most authentic and fresh sushi I've had to date. ?Life changing? Maybe not. ?However, I did love the fact that I was having sushi the way it was intended in Japan and that there was respect and discipline for the practice of making it. ?Sushi Yasuda is a place for fish lovers who want to take a journey and eat different varieties of the best fish around the world. ?This was Chef Yasuda's intention, and he truly delivers....for this I give the place four stars. ?I wasn't completely blown away, but I suspect it's because my palate may not be sophisticated enough to appreciate and enjoy all the exotic varieties of fish from a sushi purist's perspective. And for this I didn't want to punish the place in my review. ?Sushi amateurs (yes, those of you who fall into the category of ordering California and spicy tuna rolls every time and drown them in spicy mayo) may have a diminished experience here if you are averse to the "fishy taste". ?However, if you want fresh, exquisitely prepared fish without any of that trendy crap - then this is the place for you.

Wow, one of the best sushi experiences of my life and I am very picky when it comes to fish. ?Warm perfect rice, real wasabi, and home made soy sauce. ?Fish was outstanding and after 100s of sushi experiences, I was pleased to find so many new types of fish to try. ?4 types of eel, many different types of salmon and trout (how about white salmon). ?I ate a ton and only had a $10 sake and the meal came out to $175 for one person. ?The sushi menu at fist looked too cheap until I realized the prices were for one piece only. ?I recommend this place to anyone that dislikes rolls, sauces, and fusion sushi and prefers tradition and high quality fish.

Sushi Yasuda lives up to the hype. ?After hearing raves and praises about Yasuda for months, ?I was prepared to be a bit let down. ?But, Yasuda more than lived up to ?my expectations. ? On a cold windy day with crappy winter freezing rain, I walked into Sushi Yasuda and immediately felt at peace. ?My umbrella and wet coat were all slipped away, and I was quickly escorted to our table. ? The service is very efficient and friendly yet ?appeared effortless. It's a good deal to order a sashimi or sushi entree and then just supplement with pieces. ?It helps keep the prices down. ? And, anything you get will be absolutely delightful. ?It is the freshest sushi I have ever had. ?When you order, the server can tell you which fish has only been in the restaurant for less than three hrs. ?Wow! ?And you can tell, the fish literally melts in your mouth. ?The cuts are amazing. ?Mackerel, all different kinds of yellowtail were all excellent. ?King salmon was superb. ?And normally, I'm not a huge snow crab fan, but I loved it here. ?Somehow, even the rice is perfect. ?I have never had rice cooked so flawlessly. But...if you can, it's completey worth it to go omasake. ?Once you start talking to the chef, you will get in a rhythm of what you like. ?Tasmanian king salmon, Idaho Rainbow trout, right cheek Toro....by the way, this place uses the purest Japanese sea salt. ?It is so good. ?I mean just everything the freshness of the fish, the perfect cut with all those tiny extra steps and details to make it better, the beautiful sea salt, the fresh wasabi...oh I could stay there forever. ?The chef was shocked by how much sushi my boyfriend and I could eat. ?We would have kept going all night if Yasuda wasn't closing (and that definitely showed in our bill...gulp..but it was worth it) The mochi ice cream was the best I have ever had. ?I need to know where they buy it from! ?If you are a sushi lover, get to Yasuda right now! ?I only wish I had gone sooner. ?Yasuda is great for special occassions and for a splurge.

Couldn't decide what to get so I asked the waiter to just make it up! Every piece is served with the perfect balance of shoyu and wasabi so save your barbarous mixing and dipping nonsense.

Sushi Yasuda has the best salmon and fatty tuna(toro) I've tasted in America. Pretty close to the sushi in Tokyo. I tried the Omasake menu before, good but nothing to write yelp about it. I recommend just to stick with the sushi. Very fresh and very satisfying.

After reading many of the other reviews and going on a friend's recommendation to Sushi Yasuda I was not impressed in the least bit!! 1) We had a 7:45 pm reservation and my friend was seated 10 mins before the actual reservation time and said they he could ONLY wait 10 mins otherwise he'd have to forgo the table, AND there was a time frame for us to complete our dinner!! Ah NO, do they not know that a traditional Japanese dinner usually takes a min of 2 hrs!! 2) The waitress kept hovering around the table straightening up our table, asking if we wanted more this or that when we still had ?1/2 of our beverages and/or food. Plus we couldn't understand a word she was saying so she relied on me to do the talking...guess traditional Japanese ethics are clearly out the window here. 3) The food Hmm where do I begin? The sashimi was cut very thin and in the tiniest pieces I'd ever seen. Even when I traveled to Japan I had bigger cuts!! The sushi had too much rice for the thin sliced meat that you could barely taste the expensive fish. If I was back in LA and this happened I'd gone straight to In & Out for a burger to at least make me satisfied!! ?Don't get me wrong I can put the sushi away w/the best of them and all I can say for Sushi Yasuda is shame on you!!! I will never go back and continue my adventure for the love of sushi.

sushi yasuda is probably the best sushi in manhattan. one of the top 3 anyway. i will usually put away at least $150 worth of sushi each time. everything here is made in-house: grated wasabi, soy sauce, etc.. & the fish is extremely fresh and melts in your mouth. definitely fresh & i love that i can try 4 different kinds of salmon, tuna, uni, unagi, & such. you can really taste the subtle differences. which makes it a delight to eat at. go omakase if yasuda is there. :) unfortunately it is not THE best sushi i have ever had. that goes back to japan or urasawa/nozawa in la.... also! this place probably has the WORST phone service ever: they never pick up, hang up, and can be downright rude...

Blowfish to Die For Yasuda and Sushi Seki go back and forth as my favorite sushi joints in NYC. ?Until last night, it had been a while since I came and I was fortunate enough to sit at the sushi bar in front of Chef Yasuda, who works M-F lunch and dinner. ?We had the flash fried blowfish as an appetizer - basically tasted like any white flaky fish, but good nevertheless, in a ponzu sauce with spicy radish/onion. ?Then, we ordered the sushi/sashimi combo - reasonably priced at $24. ?The great thing about this here is you can choose what kind of pieces you want, where all other places choose the fish for you if you get the "deluxe". ?Chef Yasuda was so friendly and humble....I almost didn't believe it was him. ?The pieces are smaller here than Seki, but again, you get your choice here, and they have so many more exotic options/daily specials here. ?Plus, Chef Yasuda rocks - he competed in Mr. Tokyo (body building contest).

If I can have only one more sushi meal in my life I would eat at Sushi Yasuda at the bar. Definitely at the bar because the sushi chef tells you what's great today, where it came from, and adds a few extra flourishes like giant flakes of californian sea salt on your uni.

As a seasoned foodie and veteran of 17 trips to Japan , I must give Yasuda a very negative rating based on how outrageously expensive our meal was. First, these people are STINGY. Each single piece of nigiri sushi was $5-8 and TINY, just a thin sliver of fish on a lot of rice. The quality of the fish is indeed very high but not at all a justification for the swindle they are attempting here. Vegetable apps for $8 were single-bite sized. The service was mediocre and clumsy so they made up for nothing with the "good service" people use to explain away crazy high prices. The two of us spent $155 and I was sadly hungry afterwards. I actually went to a late night spot and had a snack. This emperor has no clothes. The pictures shown below are not accurate .Slick Nobu or Morimoto are better choices. Special note to trust-fund babies: Go ahead, knock yourself out here. You'll love it!

My girlfriend loves sushi, so for her birthday dinner we decided to go to Sushi Yasuda and see what high-class sushi tastes like. We made a reservation ahead of time, but make sure to arrive there on the spot - they will hold your spot for 10 minutes sharp and then let it go. The service was quick and professional as well; our appetizers, sushi, and sashimi were all brought out very quickly. Now, to the food: we first started with a couple of appetizers, both of which were delicious. Monkfish is a fish that I generally associate with being a bit meatier than average, but the flash-fried version served in small pieces was juicer than usual, with the crunchiness providing most of the texture. We also had the flash-friend eel slices, which was very delicious in its own right. They look like thin french fries, but when you bite it you get a very light, but well-balanced, taste of eel. Both were in the $10 range and won't break the bank. Similar to many other casual sushi restaurants, you get a list of everything that's available, where you can mark what you'd like. As a nice tip, the chef's recommendations are highlighted. I'm not sure if that's a function of the quality of the fish received by the restaurant on that given day, but it certainly was a nice touch. There's also so much more sushi than you ordinarily have a choice to pick from. With multiple types of clams, salmon, and other fish to choose from, it can easily be very difficult to select. We ended up going with the omakase, which ended up with us getting 18 pieces of sashimi (across 6 different types of fish), 16 pieces of sushi, and one toro scallion roll (6 pieces). Simply put...everything we ate was divine. The toro was amazing, as was the branzino (I think this was one of the sashimi we had as well). The salmon and yellowtail aren't as buttery as I've had at other places, but I do like the fact that there is a little more texture as well. One highlight was the anago; I always get unagi, but the sweetness of the freshwater eel was a real treat. Oh, and I have to mentioned the sushi rice. I'm not sure what's done differently here, but the rice is easily the best I've had with my sushi anywhere. Most places just use generic rice in their sushi and rolls, but here it adds to the dish, as opposed to being generic filler. We got mochi ice cream at the end; it's the same Mt. Fuji mochi you can pick up at an Asian convenience store, but I did like the extra green tea powder that was dusted onto the green tea mochi ice cream. The entire meal cost $170 pre-tip, which was quite a fair price from my perspective, given the top-notch quality of the food we were served. If it wasn't so expensive, I would definitely go back in a heartbeat - this is by far the best sushi I've experienced so far. Next time, I may try my hand at ordering, but if you're not sure what you want, stick with the omakase. Every piece of fish we had was great.

you cannot deny that this place has top quality ingredients - very fresh fish and excellent construction of the maki rolls. i did really enjoy the sushi / sashimi eating 101 at the front of the menu... but that's where the appreciation stops.. i hate to say it, but i really prefer specialty cocktail rolls. haha and, i've never ordered 2 rolls + soup and was STILL hungry! c'mon now. and, not sure what Hank C. ?is talking about... but i def. did not get that kind of service. the waitress was way too busy to accommodate my table -- from removing dishes prior to being finished, to having to ask multiple times for a replacement chopsticks or water! seriously? there was also quite a bit of difficulty ordering. when asking about the diff between prepared eel and fresh eel, the answer was fresh eel is fresh. smh.

best sushi in manhattan! Love the sushi men here , they explain to you everything they serve, where it came from and a lot of other interesting facts about sushi. They have the most freshest and rarest fishes here and they come from all over the world, like japan and even greece!! We did the omakase at the bar and it was over before we knew it :( but we wanted to continue! its THAT ?good....love love the white salmon, salmon roe is simply the BEST here, scallops ...toro...clams....also tried some liver here for the first time. i forgot exactly what it was but it was so good. Looked disgusting but i trust sushi yasuda too much. My friend passed on the liver though! it was like uni but better. cant wait to go back~ we proably each had like....20-25 pieces.....yes we eat alot. i dont know how many peices you get when you get their omakase...maybe 18-20? but you can always continue for more like we did. prices are very reasonable and you get your moneys worth.

Yes, I know 2 stars is not the norm for most reviews I have read for Sushi Yasuda, but I have had WAY BETTER sushi experiences. ?Maybe it's because we are Californians and have great sushi in the Bay Area. ?We came here because of the great reviews, but did not find the sushi to be extra special. ?The service was impeccable, however, yet the atmosphere was sterile and pretentious. ?Small pieces, very expensive for what you get, and the sake selections were pretty awful. ?Also, they were selective about who they were turning away -- pretty arrogant. ?If you are looking for decent pieces of sushi and a good value, this is not the place to venture. ?The sushi itself, I must say, was tasty but not enough for us to ever return.

Words cant express how good the sushi is here so i will sum it up in this sentence, far superior to anyplace i have ever had. ?Omakase is a must have and if your at the bar the chef informs you of each tasty gem ( i herd this weird term describe nigiri zushi before) you eat. ?Also apparently the proper way to eat nigiri zushi is to overlook the chopsticks and use your thumb and index finger, who knew? ?I usually keep to my self in life but the chef was so friendly i couldnt help but open up and have a conversation with such eclectic topics as childhood, m theroy, and fishing. ?It was weird but also very cool, i guess we just clicked. ?iam addicted for life. ?Arigatou gozaimasu sushi yasuda.

I had very high expectations for Sushi Yasuda. I wasn't necessarily disappointed, but was expecting a 5 star (as in, Yelp stars) experience and I didn't feel that way. Nonetheless, we enjoyed it and liked what we had. They had a wide selection and the fish was incredibly fresh. Their uni is the freshest I've had in a very, very long time. It was so...delicate! ? We had many other kinds of fish--a couple different kinds of salmon, kanpachi, tuna, clams, mackerel, etc. All were delicious. They have a special oyster--served as nigiri. Not sure what they did to it, but it was amazing. We also liked the modern/minimalist ambiance and the service was excellent.

We went there Fri evening, sat in front of Yasuda-san, and ate for two hours. ?For those who know this place, you can imagine the size of the bill we rang up. ?I kill for a good Toro, and my wife digs Salmon. ?We tried all five different types of Toro and seven Salmons. ?I didnt know there were so many variations of Toro, and it was our first time to try white salmon. ?All in all, it was an amazing experience. ?They have the best Toro and Salmon you can buy with money. ?The Uni's here get mention of honor as they're the freshest and best tasting also. ?Yasuda-san's love for his profession and serving good food, and the conversations we had around sushi heightened the experience. ?Best sushi outside of Tokyo I've come across.

Quick Impressions: 1. ?Making reservations here by phone kinda sucks - The person answering the phones took his job a little too seriously. At one point the guy said, "You will only 1.5 hours to complete your meal." ?To which I replied, "That's okay, I'm looking for sushi, not a long term relationship." ?(Okay, I didn't actually say that. ?But I wanted to.) 2. Experience was way better in person - Once I arrived, the service was WAY better. ?The wait staff was friendly. Not a needy "can I be your friend?" kind of friendly, but courteous and helpful. ? 3. Best sushi rice I have ever tasted - like all the other reviewers, I agree that the sushi rice sets Sushi Yasuda apart from other restaurants. 4. Pick the chef's recommendations - each day they come out with a new menu based on the fish. ?From the menu the chefs check off the ones they think are particularly outstanding. ?Pick those fish because they really know what they're talking about. ?In speaking with the sushi chef I realized just how knowledgeable they were ("This uni is from Santa Monica; you came at the right time because January is uni season"... ?"You like scallop guts? ?We don't have it right now because it's only available around May"...No joke, they had 5 different varieties of yellowtail and 5 different varieties of eel on the night that I visited). ?It was great learning fun facts about the fish I was eating. 5. The sushi special is a great deal - they have a sushi special of 2 rolls and 6 pieces of sushi for under 30 bucks (I think it was $23). ?It's a good place to start before ordering other pieces that you like or a reasonably priced meal if you're a small eater. 6. Sushi Yasuda has a real minimalist feel - You won't find the sushi torched or loaded with all different kinds of sauces here. ?It's straight up sushi with a little soy sauce but that's okay because the point here is to savor the freshness of the fish and to admire the surgical precision of the chefs. 7. There is no 7. ?Just go and experience it yourself. ?You won't regret it.

definitely one of the best sushi spots i have ever been to. ?after coming here, it really set the bar high. ?the fish is unbelievably fresh and the texture is absolutely perfect. ?The rice is just sweet enough and at the right temperature to compliment the fish. ? i was amazed at how knowledgeable the wait staff was about the menu (knowing the where the fish was caught, fresh vs wild, etc.) and it definitely added to the both the legitimacy of the place and the overall dining experience. ?And take their word for it when they say skip the soy sauce and just use the fresh wasabi. If it's still there, try the bouri. ?easily the best piece of sushi i have ever had. ?you know its good sushi when you can remember a single piece/bite. the only reason i can't give 5 stars is because i'm usually hungry again an hour later after sushi

One of the best sushi places in NYC! Fish is sooo fresh and their rice is perfect. Even the seaweed they use in the rolls just melt in your mouth. Good service unlike ?BONDST with their snooty servers. Best is getting omakase but if you can't afford that, they ?have a pre fixe menu and you can get a small salad or soup, 5 pieces of sushi, and 2 rolls and it's about $23 before tax/tip. Make a reservation and definitely try this place. Once you try sushi here, you'll know what sushi is supposed to taste like!

Some of the freshest sushi I've had in New York. ?I had the omakase and everything I had was delicious. ?The toro melted in your mouth, the scallop was flavorful, and the anago had an amazingly smooth texture. ?Ihad two different kinds of uni from Maine and Califiornia and both, while slightly sweet, had a subtly different flavor. ?They even gave me a few different kinds of fish that I've never had before and trust me, I've had a lot. ?I have very high standards for sushi which is why this place only gets 3 stars because while I thought it was good, I've had much better sushi as well.

Another place that has been hyped up to end up being nothing special. Yes the fish is quality, but they are so stingy on portion size. Overrated and overpriced is not what I care for. The attitude of the staff is what gets me. They are not the nicest, and the host is super rude every time I am forced to go. The only reason I am obliged to Yasuda is on a date or out of convenience since it is right next to my home.

By far the best sushi that I've had in New York. ?Done and done. Tip, make a RSVP. My friends (biceps and ms sexy dubbed by Yasuda-san, and Michelle) and have been raving about Yasuda for the past year and it was only until recently (yesterday) that I was able to sit down at the sushi bar and enjoy an awesome dinner. My friend Michelle thoroughly surprised me with what I believe to be the best seat in the house - at the sushi bar, directly in front of Yasuda himself. Awesome! ? I settled on the Sushi Matsu for dinner which includes 12 pieces of sushi and half roll. I suggest having Yasuda-san select the sushi (if you are lucky enough). He's knows what's fresh and definitely knows what he's doing behind the counter with his big ass knife. ?His selection of fish is amazing, multiple kinds of saba (mackerel), tuna and salmon galore, the oysters are amazing (Washington), scallops and clams a plenty, and my personal favorite, 2 types of uni. He finishes off each piece with some sea salt and a splash of lemon juice. Dude, its ridiculous. I hear the eel is awesome and will have to try next week (yes, I am going back next week). Pumped! ?Yasuda-san is also a crack pusher, urging you to try new types of sushi. We've all had tuna, salmon, yellowtail, mackerel, but his variety is unsurpassed (and fresh), and sweet baby squid, orange clam, and pompone (sp??). Didn't even know what that was all about. ?If you are strong, you'll submit, if you are weak, you will pass on his urges. ? This place can be affordable if you stick with the sushi matsu. If you are with your other, order 3 of them. Should definitely be enough. For the fellas, the sushi and sashimi combo probably wont make a dent on your appetite. The decor is sleek with polish light (??) oak floors and fluorescent lighting. The sushi bar is a must but the seating in front and back appeared to be comfortable. Service is outstanding with legit green tea, homemade wasabi and soy sauce. ?They don't fill up anything (except for the water), they replace it. I see myself coming here with a friend, big parties may be tough and you definitely won't be able to sit at the bar in front of Yasuda-san himself. By the way, he's hilarious and apparently loves yoga and beer. Digressing ... I know that most people say that they leave Yasuda still hungry and that if you want to leave full, be prepared to pay up. However, I think most people (myself included) may have the wrong impression of sushi after filling up on lesser quality rice and fish. If recall from the Food Channel, better quality fish and rice is supposed to be lighter and less filling. In the end, 12 pieces of sushi and a roll (admit tingly a bit small) is typically what I would order at other sushi places and I don't think sushi is that much smaller. Ultimately, if you are really hungry, switch over to the liquid diet and have a few beers or go elsewhere. Yeah, Im rambling

Freshtastic! Definitely go omakase and pray that you get the toro. It is nothing short of sublime. I thought my sushi palate was discerning, but based on some of the reviews here I am thinking perhaps Yasuda had an off day? (I rather not criticize fellow yelpers). Idk, this is my #2 sushi spot (right behind Asanebo in Studio City, CA), and it RARELY gets better than this.

Suffering from Big-Time-itis. Sushi Yasuda was always considered one of the benchmarks in NYC for sushi purity and excellence. You won't find your strangely named Katie Roll or Flaming Dragon Roll here. Only the super fresh fish and seafood. This place isn't ?an Asian/Japanese/Fusion/Trendy sushi house. It's very much legit. But here's the Rub #1...they've digressed. Because of their overwhelming notoriety of being ranked the best for so long they've slackened and let others pass them. Many of the patrons are like the tourist families that line the FDR on July 4th looking into the East River. They come just to see the fireworks, get back on the LIRR and head home to Applebees. The new diners at Yasuda are looking for the fireworks but aren't willing to invest in the whole package and end up just being tourists. Eevn though there are so many good sushi restaurants in NYC what sets Yasuda apart is that the chef goes to the fishing boats in LI at 4:00AM to get the freshest fish before the purveyors get them. Here's the Rub #2: The sushi has suffered as well. My wife had the Tekka Don Matsu and it was nearly frozen. So cold and unpalatable that we felt cheated. We thought it would be close to Honolulu's Sushi Susabune's NegiToro but it was not. The sushi deluxe was unremarkable with the usual cuts and nothing outstanding. We paid for 2 different Uni sushi pieces and both were small and very normal. Overall the meal could have taken place at a cheaper East Village sushi house like Takahachi and at half the price.

3.5 stars i came to this place with very very high hopes and expectations, and perhaps thats why i left feeling a bit disappointed and wanting more. also, i was expecting, and am accustomed, to a more intimate environment in high end sushi restaurants, this one was quite the contrary i love sushi (and no not talkng about rolls, but nigiri and sashimi, raw fish and seafood), and have eaten at plenty of very good/high end establishments and also plenty of bad ones (AYCE places even). while i have absolutely no complains about this place, it just didnt live up to the hype for me. what was really good was the sea urchin (uni), that one was one of the best i have ever eaten, quite possibly because they added sea salt..very ingenious so why the low rating when the food was good, especially the uni? well, ths place is Expensive, capital E! for the same quality, i could have eaten at a number of different places. we ordered, as fellow yelpers have suggested, the omakase...totaling 30 pieces, for 175 dollars. Delicios? Yes. Worth the money and the hassle you have to go through in securing a reservation? NO!

This is honestly the best sushi I've ever had in NY - after coming to Yasuda, you'll know the difference anywhere else you go. ?Each piece is made using the freshest slices of fish that literally melt in your mouth. ?If you can, sit at the sushi bar because you'll be able to chat with the sushi chef about the food. ?They pretty much brush enough soy sauce or sea salt and wasabi on each piece so you can simply eat it straight up. ?This way, it retains the full flavor of the seafood as it was meant to be tasted without masking it in additional soy sauce/wasabi. ?You can use the finger napkin conveniently placed on the counter to wipe your fingers in between each delicious mouthful. ?The interior decor is rather simple but very clean. ?It can get rather pricy so I come here only on special occasions (make reservations in advance!) but the food will be worth every cent you'll spend here.

What an absolute disgrace. A place even the most finicky sushi snobs of New York consider hands-down to be THE BEST sushi in the city. Never mind the utterly charmless interior, which, like many authentically Japanese places, is minimal so as not to distract from the fare itself. What we did mind was the utterly charmless attitude of the staff. Notoriously hard to get a booking, the reservationist warned us to ensure an on-time arrival lest we lose our booking. Good thing we arrived well before our 930pm last Friday night booking as the restaurant was more than half empty. After being rushed through our orders, the tiny portions of food began to arrive at pace. The sushi was hit (superb silky oysters and sweet rainbow trout) and miss (sandy giant clam and mushy sweet shrimp), while the sashimi was unevenly sliced into unattractive piles, including suspiciously waterlogged toro. The cooked food was no more consistent: bland chunks of deep fried monkfish were followed by an outstanding sliver of grilled cod. While the kitchen was having its ups and downs, the service was headed straight down the chute. Moments after our host dropped $1000 on the meal, the unthinkable happened: they kicked us out. At the stroke of 11pm, the waitress declared "We're closing now, time for the staff to eat their dinner." As we made our exit, the manager pathetically blamed the "company rules" for forcing him to close the restaurant on time. Staff dinners, company rules, downright rudeness, whatever. One thing's for sure, there are 8 customers who will never set foot back in that joint. Now more than ever, the Yasuda team should get a clue and realize that fewer people will be lining up to splurge on authentically un-Japanese hospitality like that. No matter how good their sushi is supposed to be.

This place deserves its hype, and actually while it can break your wallet, it doesn't have to if you order selectively. ?I ate there for about $60-70 a person, and enjoyed every bite. ?In particular, the California uni was one of the best single pieces of sashimi of any kind that I have ever had in my life. ?I also loved that the decor is simple and spartan, which is true to the atmosphere of most of the masterful sushi spots in Tokyo. ?Sushi is not about needless glitz and glamour--it is at heart a simple food, meant to be appreciated for its raw essence, not all the bells and whistles. ?For sushi the way it's supposed to be eaten, Yasuda is the best I've been to so far in New York.

**If you would like to see the full review, send me a message** When I read that Yasuda was leaving his namesake restaurant Sushi Yasuda to go back to Japan, I immediately picked up the phone and made a reservation in front of him because I knew if I didn't do right then it'd end up being impossible to make a reservation in front of him. ?Luckily I did because a week later I tried to make a 2nd reservation and he was completely booked for the next month. Sushi Yasuda has been my "go to" sushi place in New York for many years. ?The quality of the seafood is always outstanding (in particular their eel is by far the best in NY) and they definitely haves the best rice in NY. Yasuda told me he is going back to Japan because his daughter will go to high school soon and they had to decide whether she would go to high school here or in Japan; he is 52 and he either needs to leave now or go when he is 57 and he decided he'd rather go now. ?He plans on opening a small 8 seat sushi bar in Tokyo (forgot what district), but that is up in the air as of now as it's hard to find a good space and it's possible he may end up working for someone else. ?He also said at this point in his career he just wants to perfect his craft and he needs to go to Japan to compete and learn at the highest level of competition. Here's what we got: - Fugu kara-age (fried blowfish appetizer): This was listed as one of their special appetizers. It was perfectly fried pieces of blow fish with pickled grated daikon and scallions. ?It was excellent, the batter was light, the fish meat was very tender and clean tasting. ?4.5/5 - Tsukemono (Pickles): They gave you this as a start to the meal. ?It was just a nice combo of slightly sweet pickled cucumber, seaweed and diced carrot. ?4/5 - Big Eyed Toro (Tuna Belly): This was a nice way to start the meal off with a bang, this was one of best pieces of big eyed toro I've had in a while. ?So buttery and delicious, it was a beautifully marbled piece of fish. ? 4.7/5 - Uni (Sea Urchin): This was from Santa Barbara. ?Very clean tasting, creamy and a little bit briny. ?Really good. ?4.5/5 - Blue Fin Toro (Tuna Belly): This was also excellent, fatty although not quite as fatty as the big eyed toro and a beautiful piece of fish although it wasn't quite as good as the big eyed toro. ?4.25/5 - Ebi (Cooked Shrimp): ?I'm not the biggest fan of cooked ebi, but the version here was really nice and I loved the rock salt and squeeze of lemon on it. ?4.25/5 - Anago (Conger Eel): Eel is one of my favorite Japanese foods and Yasuda really just blows the competition in NY out of the water. ?The eel has such good texture and the meat is almost slightly sweet, I love the simple preparation of just being broiled with a dash of rock salt. ?4.6/5 - Hamachi (Yellowtail): This was from Kyushu. Nice tender meat and a good flavor. ?4/5 - Spanish Mackerel: I like Spanish mackerel a lot and the cut here was very nice and had a good clean taste. ?4.5/5 - Butterfish: A nice piece of fish although butterfish is a fairly plain tasting fish. ?4/5 - Farm Salmon: This was a really nice piece of salmon, very clean tasting. ?4.25/5 - Wild Salmon: I really liked the wild salmon, it was interesting that it really did taste different than the farm salmon and since they gave them to us at the same time you were able to really compare. ?4.5/5 - Snow Crab: Crab sushi is not one of my favorite sushi because it generally ends up being sort of bland. ?That said the version here was nice as the crab meat was quite sweet. ?4/5 - Mackerel: This was a great piece of mackerel and also one of the cleanest and least "fishy" tasting pieces of mackerel I've ever had. ?4.25/5 - Anago (Conger Eel): I had to get another piece because it was so good. 4.6/5 - Unagi / shirayaki: This is always one of my favorite things at Yasuda and it was so good again. ?The quality of the meat and flavor is just so much better than everywhere else in NY. ?4.6/5 - Oyster: Unfortunately they didn't have Peace Passage oyster which is what I normally get. ?However, this oyster was still quite good, I love the rock salt and lemon on it. ?4.25/5 - Big Eyed Toro: I had to get another piece because it was so good. 4.7/5 Sentiment aside, I think this was the best meal I've had at Sushi Yasuda and my GF agreed with me. ?Also fyi, they are not closing (http://www.nytimes.com/2¡­). ?Mitsuru Tamura is going to be head sushi chef, I've eaten in front of him several times and he is excellent. ?I'm sad Yasuda is leaving, but everything must come to an end. ?This is one of my favorite restaurants in NY and I really hope they are able to maintain the high standard of food that I have come to enjoy.

Just had lunch at Sushi Yasuda with my long-lost friend Mike. OMFG. SO UNBELIEVABLY GOOD. Two hours. The guy (our chef was Hiro, who was brilliant - sit at the bar or don't come) just makes one piece at a time and keeps asking if you like it, what you want more of, etc. I had 2 kinds of clam, 3 kinds of toro, 3 kinds of yellowtail, oysters, sweet shrimp, 2 kinds of halibut, arctic char, 2 kinds of uni, 3 kinds of scallop, a whole baby squid (1/2" long), fresh baby scallions, various handrolls, etc. OH MY GOD. Expensive but worth going here 1/3 as often as you'd go to other sushi places. SO GOOD. By far the best sushi I've had, ever. In my opinion this place urinates on Kuruma Zushi from a great height.

(well, uni and hamachi are in an ongoing feud to win favorite, but another time.) the orange clam, which was more red, was probably the most amazing sushi i have ever tried. ?it was a brand new experience, and really wasn't sure what to expect - but our chef had said it was his favorite. ?similar to uni in texture, the taste is a bit more mild, yet still full and rich in it's own virtue. ? this is a must. $150 is steep per person, but this is just something that needs to be done. ?that is all.

This place is meh. You people seriously think this is the best sushi in NY? I don't see why. 1 or 8, for example, is 10 million times better. Plus, the crowd really sucks... business men and more business men... gross. ?Can't believe you have to book weeks in advance... I'm never coming back.

Okay, this horse has been dead for ages (almost to the point where it is a fossil, now). ?Eating sushi at Yasuda is an experience - not a meal. Full disclosure - I am a sushi purist, and fanatic. ?I do eat my fair share of "spicy tuna" hand rolls, but good sushi / sashimi is what I die for. I lucked out in getting a reservation at Yasuda-san's bar when I heard he is leaving. ?I ended up being served by the master himself - and it was a treat, every step of the way. ?I was the first one in at lunch (actually 10 mins early) and had the whole restaurant to myself for nearly 20 mins into my meal. It seemed a little odd, with the whole place deathly quiet, except for the two of us discussing the fish that he had just put down on my plate. ?The whole line of sushi chefs stood deferentially, and they barely spoke a word (they were just watching us!) So here's my two cents, structured as a checklist for potential visitors to this temple of sushi. ?They are "dead" serious about their food. They expect you to be as well (serious, not dead) :) 1. If you consider a reservation just an approximate estimate... 2. If you consider a sushi meal incomplete without spicy tuna (or spicy anything)... 3. If you mix your wasabi into the shoyu, or your ginger with the sushi... 4. If you've never eaten fresh wasabi directly... 5. If you can't tell the difference between o-toro and yellowtail... 6. If you desire a bunch of sushi "rolls"... 7. If you are puzzled by folks drooling over quality nori... 8. If you want funky "fusion sushi" (one place I went to had jalapeno on yellowtail)... 9. If you've never sat at a sushi bar or been fascinated by the knifework... 10. If you want to talk business / romance / whatever, over the meal... Go someplace else. Period. I put myself in his hands, and said just give me whatever you think is best (he said they didn't have an omakase, but he will choose for me). I got gently admonished for letting him know that I dislike eel drizzled with sauce ("This is your first time here, right? Don't compare to what you've eaten elsewhere") I had three different kinds of eel, four different kinds of salmon, two different kinds of tuna, 3 servings of uni, 2 servings of sweet shrimp, 2 types of mackerel, and then a whole bunch of other fish (yellowtail, seabass, sardines etc) - 24 pcs total. ?It was a freaking delight - and I could still savor the rock salt, citrus and fish taste later that night. His nori is out of this world - you have to have at least one handroll. ?Watching him kinda score the fish before placing it on the rice is awesome. ?I got blown away by the eel, the uni and everything else I had. The mackerel was phenomenally subtle. The 'briniest' piece I had must be the sardine - but that is to be expected. I was a little apprehensive about the service, having read so much about the waitstaff's rudeness. ?Sorry, totally not so. ?They are exceedingly polite, and almost hover invisibly. In fact, one waitress was standing right behind me all the time (covering three groups of diners I think), subtly replacing my cup of hot water (I'm there for the fish, not sake, beer or anything else), AND my copy of the menu every ten minutes or so (that one beat me). ?I'd like to think they treat you as well as you treat their fish (and I am a visible, audible 'ooh aah' kind of sushi eater). ? I wish I could eat here every week (so long 401K). ?I'll be back!

I think this is the best sushi restaurant in nyc. Expect to spend a bundle but well worth it if you appreciate great sushi and sashimi. All kinds of Toro is to die for, King Salmon is very good and I had a kind of Eel that is mucho excellente (slightly sweet taste to it which was a nice twist). Order Omakase and have the chef prepare for you and tell him the kind of fish you like. From my perspective can't go wrong with the choices above. One caveat, this is pretty hardcore sushi place, so the chef will be quite insulted (esp if u r at the sushi bar) if u use any soy sauce in your sushi as it is suppose to be made ready for you to eat.

I love sushi, but I'm certainly no pro. I went with the chef's suggestions -- called omakase -- and didn't regret it, though I've no idea what I ate. I wouldn't come here looking for fancy rolls, but if you're a fan of fresh fish and delicious rice, there can't be much better.

I came here for the first time last week. The reason it gets a 4 is because I didn't really eat anything out of the ordinary here compared to other Japanese restaurants I have been to here in the States and in Japan. The prices were really good for the high quality of fresh fish I had. I always get the toro to judge a place and the toro here, although the portion was super small, was excellent! But then again, if the fish isn't super fresh, they shouldn't be serving it to us, right? Go check it out. The space is really clean and efficient. I did feel at times that our waiter was just hovering to clear our plates so that we would leave sooner but I tried to not let it bug me while I was enjoying my sushi.

I'll be honest...I am a huge fan of Americanized sushi...you know, the fancy rolls with a bunch of bells and whistles inside? ?Sushi Yasuda was not that type of place. ?So, don't go there if you some foofy roll with stuff drizzled on top, these people don't do that. ?What they do is fresh freakin' fish! ?We got 2 sashimi sampler plates as well as an appetizer and some sake. ?It wasn't a lot of food but it was a very pleasant dining experience so, I give it 4 stars. ?Our server was very attentive but not personable and the bill was very reasonable (under $100 for 2). ?I would return to Sushi Yasuda but not before I try the other 100,000 sushi spots in New York City.

The sushi here is amazing, no doubt, as is the service. ?The uni was quite possibly the most delicious piece of seafood I have eaten in a long time. ?It was so fresh and melted in my mouth like butter. ?As a matter of fact, everything we had was superb. ?If you consider yourself a sushi connosieur, you MUST come here. ?Truly. ?The omakase is a taste of sushi heaven. ?Make reservations if you're planning on coming here on a weekend for dinner. ?It gets quite busy.

I have never had such deliciously fresh sushi in my life. My fiance and I each ordered the Sushi Matsu ($36) where we choose 12 pieces of sushi and half a roll. However, you can only choose two of the same kind of sushi. The fact that I was having all 12 pieces to myself was exciting in itself! Of course I ordered double uni which was SO GOOD. Surprisingly, what blew me away was the freshwater eel. This was the first piece I chose to eat. It was warm and literally melted in my mouth! I was so surprised by the texture that I had to ask what fish this was. My fiance had chosen this piece as well. I told him to try half of the eel and stole his other half immediately LOL. All the sushi pieces were so fresh and scrumptious. There are no words to how fresh they taste. They also gave us complimentary green tea ice cream at the end which was the real thing! Not the gross milky light color one but the dark forest-green color green tea ice cream! Also, if you order green tea, you get constant free refills! And it's high quality green tea! I suggest ordering cold green tea. Very refreshing!

My new least-favorite restaurant trend is the influx of scene-y sushi restaurants. Sure, Nobu's great, but now every sushi restaurant has to have 9089 billion rolls with silly names and ridiculous sauces that have been deep-fried. That's why I love Sushi Yasuda: it's nothing at all like that. Just delicious and fresh sushi that doesn't need to hide itself in tempura dough and sprinkles. I'm also fond of the quiet and chill ambiance. The entire experience is very zen. If you want quality sushi, I can think of no better place in Manhattan than Sushi Yasuda.

I've been wanting to try out this place on my NYC food hunt and finally got the chance for lunch! Setting: As others have mentioned, this place isn't out to shower you with decorative delights. It's very simple and sparse. Tables are a good distance from each other and you have plenty of room to move around. Food: Some of the freshest sushi I've had. We ordered the uni (Alaska, apparently the Maine one is stronger) especially because my friend and I are huge fans and know that uni should only be tasted at a restaurant you trust (you know what happens otherwise - ack). We also made our other friend try the uni and she admitted it was a good experience - not bad for a non-raw fish person. I still prefer the uni I had at Hatsuhaha, but the uni here is great too - creamy and tasty. For my friend and I, the bigger test is the tuna. I'm really not a tuna fan and usually don't eat tuna at other sushi restaurants. But I have to say their tuna tasted fresh and not to heavy. We ordered the Sushi Sashimi combination, which came with 3 types of sashimi, 1 roll, and 4 kinds of sushi. The sushi (sea scallop, cherrystone clam, Salmon, squid) were all wonderful! So fresh - literally melts in your mouth! We couldn't even decide which we liked better. Service: No complaints. Very good service. Except remember to make a reservation (hard lesson learned). Notes: The bill is a bit hefty, but not too bad for this neighborhood. If you don't like simplicity though, you may be a bit bored (comment by my friends). I thought it was fine.

My favorite sushi in all the world. A friend recommended it several years ago, and it was love at first bite. The place was totally booked, but the W Hotel called and got my mom and I in late night. It was her birthday, but it seemed like mine too. AMAZING. Sit at the bar, order what the owner recommends. Everything is absolutely perfect. I still have the menu from my first visit 4 years ago. I had no idea how many types of salmon there were. And I am not a fan of salmon sushi. But this was melt in your mouth and simply wonderful. The miso soup with the tiny mushrooms, the sake, the service, the atmosphere. You leave with a huge smile and think of it for days after you are home...

The Boy and I came here for a belated V-day dinner and it was even better than I remembered. We had the omakase, told our lovely waitress (she was really attentive and sweet, even giggling at our orgasmic expressions when we ate our first sea urchin of the evening) that 'no we don't have allergies and are happy (nay, excited!) to try anything', and ordered a drink each (Sapporo for him, hot oseki for me). That evening we had the following sashimi: salmon, yellowtail tuna, abalone, and a few more that I can't remember the names of. As for sushi, we had the following: toro and scallion roll, fattiest tuna (that's what the waitress said and she wasn't kidding!), medium-fat tuna, rare whitefish, yellowtail tuna, sweet shrimp, scallop, sea urchin, salmon roe, and ?barbecue-sauce-brushed eel. Of these, the Boy and I agreed that our favorites were the toro/scallion rolll, fattiest tuna, sweet shrimp (so fresh and sweet!), sea urchin (this was my favorite of the evening; I will dream of the texture and taste of this one until our next SY visit), salmon roe, and the eel. For our second round, we picked our favorites and then also got the Peace Passage oyster (was good, but not remarkable; I prefer my oysters in a shell with a bit of brine and not on a warm bed of sushi rice), squid, and lemon/sea-salt eel. The lemon and sea salt eel was so so heartbreakingly good; in fact, if I had a meal consisting solely of this eel and sea urchin, I would have left SY happy. For dessert we got dollar-coin-sized mochi (half green tea, half red bean), which were the perfect portion size because we were quite full at this point. The mochi wasn't too sweet, which is great for a girl that ranks salty, sour, and spicy as better than sweet. All in all, we had a great experience in SY; hopefully it won't ?be another year and a half before we come again!

We at at Sushi Yasuda back in October 2009. ?This is truly one of the most special meals I've had anywhere, thanks largely to the man himself. We ordered the omakase and let Chef Yasuda bring it on. He regaled us with stories of seaweed quality and when and where they obtain various fish, etc. It was fascinating. (This is in between our "oos" and "ahs" of eating some of the freshest sushi I've ever had.) He's right about the seaweed, too. His is crisper and more delicate than I usually get. I tried sea urchin for the first time - it literally exploded with flavor. We had about 15 pieces, and tuna roll (he told us how most restaurants use spicy sauce to literally cover up sub-par fish). He asked us if there was anything we didn't like, and my husband cited squid or octopus. Chef Yasuda replied that the squid was very fresh that day, and we must try it. He was right. After he made about 60 cuts in it, it was perfect and not the least bit chewy, which has always been my husband's problem with raw squid in general. He also made us a sprout hand roll. It is the first hand roll I've had that I actually liked. Once again, I credit the quality of seaweed. He hilariously told my husband he had his sushi in a "submission hold," and proceeded to correct our use of chopsticks. Love it! When we were leaving, he asked where we were from. When we said Austin, he gave us the Longhorn "hook 'em" sign. I would do a lot for a picture of that. It was a highlight of a trip filled with very good eating. We are considering a special trip to New York just to eat there again.

For a sushi restaurant with a common Japanese name, it serves the largest variety of interesting fish at its freshest. ?Where else can you taste the difference among multiple types with varying degrees of freshness for the same fish and find names on the menu that you've never heard of? ?Learn how sweet anago and rich unagi kuro is compared to the usual fare from China with preservatives served at most restaurants. ?Peak your sushi experience by tasting of the flavors of the ocean with uni from California, Peace Passage oyster, and orange clam himo. ?Other highlights include the sardines, a variety of yellow tails and mackerel, and giant clam (mirugai). You will barely touch your soy sauce because it's brushed on for you to grab with your hands, which is how sushi should be enjoyed. ?End your sushi experience with tamago chilled to dessert perfection with the sweet feeling of eating ice cream. Unfortunately, I was disappointed that the fragrant smells of the hondashi in the chawanmushi were not carried over to my taste buds with a flavorful custard treat. ?The toro and butterfish were overrated compared to the other fish. ?Moreover, the sushi chefs seem to be friendly to gals, but reserved when serving sushi connoisseurs or non-Japanese guys, who speak their language.

The decor, quite elegant, but probably typical of higher end sushi places in NYC. ?The service, pretty good. ?Waitperson attentive, and the sushi chef was good to me. ?The price, fair, considering the fame, they could have charged me three times the price and I would have forked it up. ?But it's probably 1-1.5X regular price, for the work, not bad. ?I went this Monday evening at the sushi bar. ?I started with whatever the sushi chef recommended (basically he went down the list with the checked item on the menu). ?The sushi were sliced thin, not "too small", but just enough. ?The flavors were excellent, but not out-of-this-world as many on this board put it. ?Perhaps it's because I am partial to sashimi. ?I think the difference may be that they flavor it for you, so to control the amount of soy sauce on the fish. ?Therefore, it tastes more flavorful than your usual sideways dip, trying not to get any soy sauce on the rice, and ending up with less sauce than should. ? Of the things that stood out to me were sockeye salmon, orange clam, and bluefin toro (above average). Unfortunately, I did not see 25 kinds of tuna, tuna cheek, male uni...etc. ?The choices for that day were only slightly above regular selection. ?The uni they had were plain California uni which you can buy anywhere. ?In conclusion, it's a decent sushi place. ?It's got good decor. ?The price is fair for what you get. ?But if you are looking for "the mecca" or that one special place which is worth a special trip for, I don't think Yasuda quite met my expectations, per my one time monday evening experience. ? Well, next stop, Sushi Daiwa, Tokyo.

Sushi perfection. ?You must sit at the bar and enjoy the omakase. ?Service was perfect. ?Every detail was flawless. ?The decor is beautiful. ?The sushi is at the highest level. ?Everything melts in your mouth. ?I couldn't help but order uni and blue fin toro over and over. ? ?You'll have to travel to Tokyo if you want to match or exceed this experience.

I came here for a work dinner with 3 others and it was a splendid meal! Food: 4/5. They have toro, so that's a huge bonus right there. I love toro. I could eat it all day. The four of us got miso soups, the grilled seabass off the special appetizers menu, edamame, toro rolls, squash rolls, cucumber rolls, king salmon, sea scallops, Spanish mackerel, and a type of yellowtail I can't remember. Miso soup was definitely a grade above regular miso at Japanese restaurants--tasted like it was lovingly cooked in the back. They also have a "red" miso soup which my manager said was delicious. The grilled seabass was cooked nicely, but I didn't like the picked turnip on top very much. Edemame was addictive, but I think it's pretty difficult to get edamame wrong. Toro rolls were perfect--buttery and soft with a nice ratio of toro to rice. The Japanese squash rolls were surprisingly tasty as well. The king salmon was SO GOOD! I've been missing salmon like this for so long! The yellowtail was wonderfully smooth, mackerel was decent but a tad chewy, and the sea scallops were divine. To finish we got green tea and red bean mochi ice cream. Delicious. The outside wasn't too thick, as it is in many places, and the ice cream tasted like pure matcha whipped in cream--perfect. Also notable was the fact their ginger here is strangely tasty, as is the little side of seaweed they serve. Service: 5/5. They take your coats upon arrival and you don't need to get a tag--they have it ready for you at the door when you leave. Our waiter was polite, never tried to upsell us (he at first mentioned the chef selection, but we decided to pick our own pieces and he obliged without a pause), and our food came very quickly. They empty your filled-up bowls of edamame shells continuously, change plates per course, have fresh towels to wash your hands, and give you little bamboo sporks for ginger/wasabi and ice cream. Very attentive, lovely service. Ambiance: An even mix of business and date, the restaurant is incredibly spacious. They could've jammed a lot more tables into the place but opted for something more comfortable. Brightly lit, spotlessly clean, upscale but not stuffy. You have to make a reservation and they won't hold it if you arrive later than 10min into the reservation. Reservations are good for 2 hour dinners, then you need to leave (apparently, we left before our time was up). Definitely worth a visit!

I really enjoyed the attentive service, the clean design of the restaurant and the wide variety of high quality sushi at Sushi Yasusa. The fish was really light and flavorful in all the right ways. Having attained a 28 rating for food in Zagat, I had very high expectations for the sushi. ?In my opinion, everything was great, but not 28 great, maybe 25 great. Though I will highly recommend Sushi Yasuda, it didn't quite beat out my lifetime favorite sushi experience at a mom and pop, unnamed sushi restaurant in San Francisco.

i was looking for lunch on my last day in nyc and i remembered my friend recommending this place so i came here for lunch and sat at the bar. ?it was a nice decor place where a lot of ppl in suits were having lunch. i felt a little out of place since i was on my vacation wearing jeans and tshirt. ?i sat at the bar and the sushi chef welcomed me warmly. ?he was very nice and friendly. ?told me the specials for the day and handed me the sushi menu. ? their sushi was pricey since it was 1 piece per order. blue fin toro big eye toro kanpachi striped bass sea bass arctic char jack mackerel squid fin giant clam/mirugai sea scallop/hotate sea urchin/uni all of these were excellent. ?the feeling of the fish and rice in your mouth was perfect. ?the texture, the size, the fish and rice portion was well balanced. ?very fresh. i dunno what else to say... i just know that i have to come back when i m back in nyc! ?oh, and i have to save up also... my lunch was $75

I made birthday reservations here for myself, and wow. I was absolutely impressed with the freshness and complexity of the fish and their flavors. I started out with a white miso soup, and went on to have a good amount of sashimi and a bit of sushi. I asked the chef to give me an assortment of whatever was best, and whatever he recommended. I was given amazing hamachi, mild and delicate, as well as orange clam, firm and oceanic, and toro that positively melted. The uni was unlike any I'd ever had. It was sweet, and the texture was perfect. A seasonal special I had was the sea scallop gut - amazing. Service from the chef was attentive and polite, and he genuinely seemed to share in the enjoyment of the diners. Amazing. Will definitely eat here again whenever I'm in NYC :)

There's nothing really new to say here - fresh fish, great sushi. ?As something new to add - they have tamari as a substitute to their soy sauce so if you have a gluten allergy you're good to go. ?They also seem to have added a pinot grigio to the wine menu. ?Also, dress was quite casual - 50% of people in jeans/shorts and 50% people in khakis/buttons downs (for men). ?Bottom line is to eat smart here unless you want to run up a huge tab. ?Altogether we got two fixed price sushis, a toro roll, and a hand roll of sea urchin and 3 alcoholic beverages for $130. ?we couldve gotten out for $60 had we not ordered the toro by the piece and gotten the hand rolls. ?definitely an experience worth trying.

I haven't had sushi this bad since Go Sushi Closed up. It was not fresh, fishy flavour and dry texture too. Tasted off. Tiny slivers served. I think the sushi sashimi combo was hardly 200 calories worth of food. Great ambiance, wonderful service, well healed crowd, ?but mediocre sushi at best.

Goods: served by Mr. Yasuda himself, impeccably good sushi rice, fresh fish, reference of price.* Bad: Entrance to the restaurant is disorganized and hectic (the coat check almost lost my scarf)--wish it can be hidden from the main dinning room. Price: 2 Omakase, 2 sake, tips: 230-240$ *Despite getting the Omakase, there's actually a list of the sushi available with price on it, so I didn't feel as "in the dark" as in places like Gari or Sasabune.

He even made uni taste good. ?I tried so many different fish that I normally wouldn't even know existed. ?It was so much fun. ?It is very expensive, but worth it. ?Next time we visit, we'll have to sit at a table to see what that's like.

Oh my f*ck. Yasuda has spoiled me so rotten that it's impossible for me to be truly pleased at any sushi spot in my current place of residence (Vegas). We booked a spot in front of Yasuda himself, and he made sushi only for our party of 6. This was last summer, and I still can't forget how fresh all the fish was...just incredible.

MUST TRY!! Went here for dinner tonight and it is by far the best sushi I've ever had. ?On top of the quality of the sushi, the experience of sitting in front of Mr. Yasuda and chatting with him was phenomenal! ?He is so friendly and my boyfriend and I learned a lot about fish, rice, sushi, etc. ?We learned how sushi should properly be eaten, where his fish is from, his technique, and where the ginger, wasabi and soy sauce were all from. We both ordered the sushi and sashimi combo including dessert, for $22.50. What a steal! ?The sashimi came with three different types of fish, two of the fish had three pieces each and the other had two pieces. ?Then it came with 4 pieces of sushi and a 6 piece roll. ?To begin, it comes with a choice of soup or salad and to end, a choice of dessert (mochi, ice cream, or fruit). ?The meal also concludes with a cup of tea. To begin, I started with the salad. ?The dressing came on the side which was perfect so that the salad wasn't drenched in it. ?The dressing itself was extremely tasty. ?For the main course, we let Mr. Yasuda pick out all our fish. ?For sashimi, we had tuna, mackarel, and yellowtail. ?Delish! ?I can't remember what fish we had for sushi except for the salmon. But I remember all four pieces just melted in my mouth. ?For the roll, we got to try the king salmon and the spanish mackerel. ?I enjoyed both, but liked the king salmon slightly better. ?Rarely do I ever eat rice, but I was told by a friend that the rice is one of the best parts and she is absolutely right. ?The seaweed was something else! ?Everything together was just out of this world! ?I was pretty full, but I'm also not a very big person. ?My boyfriend was not full so he ordered another roll and sushi. ?By Mr. Yasuda's recommendation, he ordered the tanzanian trout roll and the sea urchin sushi. ?The trout again was delish! ?As for the sea urchin, most people hate this, but my boyfriend really enjoyed it. ?Then to finish off our meal we had the mochi and ice cream. ?I really liked the red bean ice cream. Now to comment on the service. ?Wonderful! ?Not overbearing, but came to clean the table if I dripped soy sauce, etc; constantly refilled my water and checked if we needed anything. Things I highly recommend if you're going to try this place: - make reservations - ask to sit at Mr. Yasuda's station (sushi bar); he works 5 days a week M - F - go with his recommendations I am going back in less than a week!

Overview: food is stellar (one of the best sushi places); ambiance is so-so; service is average; price = less expensive than expected FOOD Appetizers: Aka misa (red miso soup w mushrooms) $6.50 - tiny cup of soup; so small i thought this was a condiment for the soup; delicious; bold miso flavor; tiny mushrooms; definitely get this, but only expect a few spoonfuls Striped bass appetizer - amazing; delicately fried fish covered with some mushy brown topping (didn't have too much taste so i couldn't figure it out); i don't have too much detail on this dish b/c it was accidentally served to us; we didn't order it) Sea bass with soft tofu and plum broth ($10.50) - not as good as the striped bass app; plum flavor was too strong and distracting; fish was amazing quality; just flaked off and had great chunks; presented almost like a plum soup with chunks of bass (just boiled) and tofu Sushi: Sushi take ($22.50) - 8 pieces of sushi (no choice) and a half a roll (from special list); sushi is yellowtail, tuna, salmon, etc. - basic fish - amazing quality; fresh; not fishy tasting; rice is really delicious on its own (try it w/out soy sauce/wasabi); can't really distinguish the taste b/t all of the fish but all were top notch quality; i chose Eel for the half roll - best eel roll i have EVER had in my life; sauce was full of flavor and eel was not fatty at all (my biggest pet peeve) Tuna roll - surprised that the amount of fish was so small; maybe a half centimeter in diameter; delicious though King salmon roll - more fish than in tuna roll; great quality Dessert options are horrible (just ice cream and mochi), so i didn't get any. ATMOSPHERE Seemed like all of the service staff were straight from Japan; gave it an authentic feel, but many didn't speak great English; had to repeat certain basic phrases; waiter was perfectly nice, but messed up a few times (gave us the wrong app, but okay since we werent' charged for it; took a while to get the beer) They tend to rush people; when making reservations, they say there is a hard stop 2 hours from your reservation. The interior decor is super minimalistic; not a place for a romantic meal; bright lighting; woody/bamboo decor but mostly nothing to give it any character; table spacing was okay (not too cramped); casual attire was worn by most (jeans seemed common for Saturday night). We had a reservation at 7:30 PM, and the restaurantw as only 3/4 full. Also, it has a "grade pending" sanitation grade right now, which made me a little nervous. Overall, great place for sushi if you are craving it, but not a romantic date place or a restaurant where you feel pampered and relaxed.

It kind of freaked me out to go to a sushi meal in the old East sushi space (weird), but Sushi Yasuda was FANTASTIC! We sat at the sushi bar and had a wonderful meal.

Getting reservations at the sushi bar is pretty much impossible since everyone wants to be served by Chef Yasuda, so my husband and I settled for a table: 2ppl, at 6:00pm. (The people who got the 8:00pm reservation held chopsticks with two hands. Enough said.) Upon sitting down, we were each handed 3 menus, which was unnecessarily confusing, partially because our waitress barely spoke (both, English, and out loud) and also because what one menu stated that it was ok to order, the other one contradicted it. Still, the major problem was that the waitress did not understand anything we asked her, and when she pretended to, just to keep things moving, she got our orders wrong... repeatedly throughout the night. (Poor dear, she was in training, and utterly incapable of serving, which is partially why my rating is so low for this restaurant.) Alexander quickly took the charge and ordered sake, and a few appetizers (which, surely enough, were botched by our waitress.) Sashimi, sushi, maki, hand rolls... We tried them all. The prices looked friendly, and the quality was better than we could've hoped for. With each bite, I closed my eyes and let the sashimi pieces melt between my lips, leaving the gentlest notes of taste on my palette. The yellowtail sashimi was spectacular, as were the scallops. The uni, my favorite, was the most fragrant I've ever had in my life. The ikura was lovely, each piece of roe savory, tender, almost barely sweet. And the rice... The rice was magnificent! Each grain was distinguishable in flavor and texture, and it was its own delicacy on par with the best cuts of fish. The real standout of the night were the hand rolls, which we ordered 5 different versions of. Each hand roll is a unique combination of crunchy nori, tasty rice, flavorful fish, and a dab of wasabi & shoyu. If there is anything that I highly recommend at Sushi Yasuda, it would be that. My only pet peeve about the sushi/sashimi orders is the actual size of servings - they were extra small. Example: a $5 salmon sashimi dime-sized cut comes in 3 pieces... for all to enjoy! My dilemma is that I am a 6'1, served sushi that was created and intended for someone who is 5' and half my size. My husband is 6'4, so we ordered, and ordered, and ordered... Many times we had to re-order because the waitress did not get it right the first time, and often forgot to bring doubles of things I specifically asked for to share with Alexander. It was annoying and distasteful, especially for a high-profile place like Sushi Yasuda. For our meal of $180, I felt that I was eating sushi blindly, with no explanation, no recommendation, and no care from the restaurant that thrives on its reputation for being the best. At some point we stopped trying to communicate with our waitress, and eyeballed anyone else who could stop and help take our order... again, and hopefully right this time. The dessert of mochi ice cream was fabulous, and it did not require much explanation: green tea, and black bean. Alexander loved it so much, that we ordered seconds. (That sealed the deal: we were giants, visiting the land of little people and tiny food.) And for the first time in my life, I did not feel bad tipping 15% for poor service. Taking our coats back from the Mexican coatcheck boy (yes, really!), I snapped the last picture of the restaurant interior, and leaving, I didn't feel the urge to ever go back for another meal.

Best sushi in the world. ?I've eaten Japanese food in DC, Tokyo, LA, Chicago, Boston, London and other places, and this NYC restaurant beats everything else. ?Unless you speak Japanese, and you know where to go, you may not find sushi this good even in Tokyo. Massive menu of exotic salmon (like 5 different types), lots of other options. ?Perfect service, atmosphere and price.

I'm not going to mess around. ?This is the best sushi in NYC, and on par with many restaurants in Japan. ?This is real, very fresh, traditional Japanese style raw fish, not raw fish doused in deceptively tasty mayonnaise-based sauces or cream cheese. They fly most of their fish in from Japan overnight, so they have a crazy selection of unique fish you've probably never even heard of it. ?Make sure you sit at the bar, so you can talk to Chef Yasuda. ?He's super friendly. The prices are expensive. ?But choose wisely, and your funds will be intact. ?Choose poorly, and you'll have to sell your body to pay off your debt. ?And I can't imagine that would be worth much. ?Expect to drop anywhere from $50-150 per person, without alcohol, tip, and tax. RECOMMENDED Chef's choice (omakase) prix fixe. ?This is the option that will force you to sell your body. ?So start working out. ?Some highlights: kuchiko (sea scallop "liver"), sea urchin, yellowtail belly, king salmon, sea eel, Spanish mackerel, Tasmanian trout, scallop, fatty tuna. NOT RECOMMENDED I don't think I've had a bad piece yet.

Ahh, another midtown sushi spot. ?You'll see a few of these in my reviews. ?The sushi was very good; portion size was pretty good. ?I was a little unhappy with the customer service; nothing in particular but it seemed as if my party was a bit ignored and the food took a little while to arrive. ?That being said; I've sat at a table and the sushi bar and if you have the chance take the sushi bar. ?You can ask the chef for recommendations and they seem to take care of you a bit more. ?This place is a bit more pricey than other midtown sushi restaurants, but you definitely won't go wrong here.

It's been a few weeks ago since I was in NYC, and I can't believe I almost forgot to write a Yelp review on this phenomenal restaurant. ?I really was pleasantly surprised when my friend or pseudo-date agreed to take me here for lunch. ? Another friend actually recommended this place to me, who told me that it's difficult to get in without a reservation and that it was expensive with authentic Japanese sushi chefs and most likely the best sushi place near grand central station where my date's office is. ?My date initially suggested Bobby Flay's restaurant... which I would have been totally fine with, but my other friend wanted to test my date... knowing that my most favorite type of food, hands down is sushi. It was raining that day when he picked me up; my last day in the city which dampened my mood a bit, but when he said lets go wherever you want and told the cab guy the address of Sushi Yasuda, it immediately put a big smile on my face. ? Well the decor of the place was modern with light wood; quite stale not warm or romantic, but definitely gears to the business clients in suits. ?The sushi bar was decent size with a Japanese sushi chef in front of nearly each seat. ?Our chef spoke very little English, but somehow we got by. ?Everything we ate was purely amazing. ?Each and every fish was incredibly fresh and delicious. ?My favorite was the Uni and Toro as always:) ? It was also cool that it was like we had our very own sushi chef catering to all our needs. ?He wouldn't let us order a bunch of stuff at one time, because he wanted us to savor the sashimi or ?sushi that was immediately in front of us before asking us for our next order. ?And the recommended sake was just as fabulous! ? On normal circumstances, I would not come here on my own because I couldn't afford to spend as much as he spent for just lunch. ?SO I am blessed to have the opportunity to experience dining here thanks to my friend.

I'm only giving this place 4 stars because of how expensive this place is. Other than that, I really enjoyed my dining experience here. This is the best sushi I've had so far. Extremely fresh and so tender that it melts in your mouth. The eel was incomparable to what I've had before. It was out of this world. The service was great as well and we received our food fairly quickly considering the place was packed. We got about 12 pieces of sushi, 2 rolls, a salad and mochi ice cream for $130. I know of a few spots where all of that would have cost me half of that but that's okay because I got to have some really great cuts of fish! And why not treat yourself to exquisite sushi?

Absolute dream for sushi minimalists. Even my dad, who is a bit of a sushi snob was impressed. Everything is epic. From the pieces of translucent fish, lightly vinegared sushi rice to the brothy seafood miso soup. I highly recommend their fatty tuna, anago, king salmon and egg custard sushi. The anago was so freaking good that I couldn't help exhaling a sigh of pleasure. Their green tea ice cream is also to die for. Creamy and slightly bitter. If they didn't make it themselves, it's probably imported from Japan because I haven't tasted green tea ice cream like this for a long time. Service is typically Japanese (aka you are treated like king/queen) and the interior is pleasantly airy. Sit in the counter if you can, because that's where all the action's at! You can ask for recommendations and watch the sushi chefs conjure up little pieces of seafood heaven. It's expensive. But soooo worth it. Anyone can easily turn into a sushi snob after eating here.

best sushi i've ever had, hands down... and well worth the price. no typical 'omakase' menu, you just let the sushi chef send out their selections and tell them when to stop! our server recommended we start with 12 and then order more as we liked... turned out to be 5 more each. best bites: 1. shirayaki: grilled freshwater eel. skin was blistered and salted, meat was seriously sweet and tender 2. white salmon: more flavorful than even the tuna in my opinion, fatty and melty just the same 3. sardine: hints of tiny bones, but the flesh (scored very prettily) was like butter. 4. netoro handroll: we couldn't refuse our server's excitement over this recommendation. altho the filling was forgettable, i'm so glad we didn't miss the seaweed!! not overly salted, it had substance and chew. surprising hits: 1. mochi ice cream: the red bean didn't taste artificial at all, and the green tea had a generous amount of matcha powder on top 2. reasonable sake prices: carafe of otokoyama for $10! i feel like i could've saved some money if i had done research on yelp before my visit.. i would've gone for the sushi matsu dinner to start, instead of ordering individually! well, lesson learned for my next visit...

I was so excited to try Sushi Yasuda. ?All the reviews had been wonderful. ?I have to admit though, when I went, I was a little disappointed. ?We mainly got sashimi but it was more like little pieces of fish instead of nice sized pieces. ?It was strange. ?The price is by piece, but if we ordered 1 piece, 2 came but it was 2 tiny scrap like pieces. ?Maybe they counted 2 halves as a whole? ?Everything had a very nice flavor, however, there was no texture to it b/c everything was so small. ?The flash fried shrimp appetizer was very good so maybe the rest of their food, besides their sashimi, was better. ?I'd love to hear if anyone else had this experience.

What a sleek sushi restaurant! ?With a reservation made a week in advance, we went to check out this place and left happily fed! ?It's very starkly decorated, modern and white, but this place is more about the food than the decor. ?Instructions on the menu direct you how to eat your sushi and use soy sauce, etc. ?While we ate our edamame, our 'used edamame bowl' was hardly ever full as we were consistently waited on and the bowl was cleared so often. ?The fish was fresh and presented nicely. ?I would recommend setting aside some time to make a reservation and check this place out to eat some good sushi. ?A great NY sushi joint that's close to Grand Central. ?We were mindful of what we ordered, therefore we didn't spend an exorbitant amount, so no need to be that concerned about prices.

Best sushi in the United States. ?I live in Los Angeles, where you'd think they'd be better, but I've yet to find a local place that matches the experiences I've had at Yasuda.

I've been to Sushi Yasuda a couple of times and every time I go I always have an amazing experience. ?The sushi is in my opinion the best in Manhattan (yes, better than Masa). ?Get the chef's Omakase special, it will probably run you around $130-$150 per person but it is well worth the money. ?The sushi melts in your mouth and is very fresh. ?Try and sit at the bar in front of Yasuda (he's an interesting guy and likes to talk). ?The decor is very nice and the restaurant in general is just top notch in every way. ?This is one of my favorite restaurants and I would recommend Sushi Yasuda over any of the top sushi places in Manhattan.

for a pure sushi experience, i don't know if anything can compare to sitting at the bar and getting the omakase. ?being treated to a single piece of sushi at a time is a treat in itself, and truly makes you savor each and every bite as it comes along. sadly, every piece of sushi you have after this experience will pale in comparison, but its a worthy price to pay to live through the tastiness you get here. ? don't expect any frills or any special toppings, preparations, or gimmicks- just fresh fish, perfectly seasoned rice, and the simple yet complex combinations that result. EDIT AFTER ANOTHER VISIT: Still the best sushi in town, as far as i've tried, but beware cause it can really hit your wallet hard if you're not careful! ?i went with a seasoned veteran of the place who has been served by yasuda-san for years. ?she dictated the pace and the items, which included a few interesting appetizers (fried eel backbone, some sake marinated grilled fish ?) and while the meal was divine, and filling, -- the price of close to 200 bucks a person was a bit hard to swallow!

The best sushi you'll have in the United States. In New York City, at the very least. Honestly it really depends on what you like. I've never been attracted to the kind of Nobu-style fusion sushi that many popular sushi places in NYC does. What I personally like is clean, pure taste of each fish atop fluffy, subtly seasoned rice with minimal seasoning only enough to compliment the taste of the fish, and this is exactly what Sushi Yasuda will serve you. Sat on the sushi bar in front of Yasuda-san and of course omakase was the only way to go. He'll ask you what you like and what you don't like, but I'd say trust him and tell him he can bring you whatever he wants. That's what we did and we loved every single bite. Three or four different kinds of eel (two different kinds, two different preparations) three different kinds of salmon, at least two different kinds of tuna, oyster, sea scallop, two different preparations of squid, fluke, salmon roe, and I'm sure forgetting a few. But I can't forget uni. Hands down the best uni I've ever had. He made a nigiri first then a hand roll after I told him how much I loved it. Definitely ask him for an uni hand roll, you will not regret it! But there was not a single thing that I didn't like. Yasuda-san is great to talk to as well, totally down-to-earth (unlike their receptionist) full of stories and lessons about sushi if you're ready to soak them all in. No, it's not exactly cheap, but yes, it is worth every single penny. I can't wait to go back already.

went here once over the winter break and i'm a fan. the place does not have a noticeable sign outside other than the faint imprint of fish logo so you really have to pay attention to the street number to find it. we came here for lunch and ordered the omakase. the waitress asked wether we also wanted sushi in addition to sashimi (which we naively said yes.) BIG MISTAKE. the order came out to be enough food for 4 people, and it was only lunch. as delicious as it was, we could only finish about half of the food which is a small tragedy considering how fresh and delicious the cut of fish we were getting were. next time, i would go ahead and order their lunch specials (usually with just salmon and tuna nigiri or sashimi) for $25 and add extra orders of white tuna or toro rolls (which i loved) a la carte. you get more than enough food and great quality cuts of fish without breaking the bank.

I guess I'm not a sushi purist but I suppose this place is pretty close to the sushi of Japan from the fresh ingredient to the no frills small pieces. It was good, just kinda boring to me. Plus the waiter really rushed us and didn't explain what anything was. It could have been a better experience if the waiter introduced us to some new things, we asked for suggestions but he really needed to be prodded. I really liked the appetizers, the deep fried shrimp and pan fried tuna were delicious. But it doesn't make sense to have that then go to the bland-ish sashimi after. Place is really pretty and the green tea mochi I had for dessert was divine.

...Yasuda's rice is a star in itself, with silky, firm pearls of kernels with the added palatable ambience of traditionally-aged vinegar. The rice doesn't just support the fish, but accentuates it as well, helping the tongue appreciate each different fish' individual nuance and taste, from the silky and clean earthiness of the King Salmon to the creamy, briny--but not "fishy"--unctuousness of the Sea Urchin....

Really good sushi - even for asian people. The fish is fresh and if you sit at the bar, you can get tips from the chef on what his recommendations are. I'm not Japanese, so I didn't know this, but supposedly maki's (rolls) are supposed to be eaten with your bare hands. Also, you're not supposed to dissolve the wasabi into your soy sauce. Its awesome here! The only downside may be that its on the expensive side - compared to Yuka (UES) which is totally a different class of restaurant, but all you can eat for $20.

Short Review: ? MOUTHGASM Long Review: I knew this place was both popular and expensive. ?In order to combat those problems, I decided to A) go during lunch to take advantage of the lunch specials as some have noted and B) go on a weekday by myself to maximize the chances of getting a seat. ?After a 40 minute ride on the 7 train from Flushing, I have finally arrived at THE Sushi Yasuda. ?My heart is pounding, blood rushing through my body. ?I could not wait to dig in on the amazingness of Yasuda's sushi. ? "1 please" (me) "I'm sorry, you need a reservation" *jaws drop in disappointment* =FAIL #1 So I called them up an hour later to make a reservation for a future day, again on a weekday for lunch to take advantage of the cheap lunch specials. Second time, I showed up and was immediately seated in the sushi bar. ?Lucky me because the sushi bar is THE place to sit. ?I ordered the sushi and sashimi lunch special in order to save money and for $22.50, you get a salad, 3 types of sashimi, your choice of 4 nigiri sushi and choice of 1 roll. ?Everything was super delicious. ?Rice: perfection. ?Fish: fresh fresh fresh (do they teleport their fish from the ocean off the coast of Japan???). ? Some highlights: ? Sashimi (forgot which type of fish I got): every piece really melted in my mouth White King Salmon Roll: is there crack in the nori??? Anago (eel): holy smokes! so this is what non-frozen eel tastes like Scallop: unbelievable! Remember that I was trying to save money by going for lunch? ?Well I had already ordered the Anago and an extra scallop sushi a la carte when I heard the guy next to me ask the chef for toro sushi. ?And I'm thinking mmmm toro sushi... "I'll have a toro sushi as well." ?A small nugget of perfectly seasoned rice with a shiny slice of toro goodness is promptly served on my bamboo plate. ? I took a bite and I j**z in my pants (ok not really, but it was sooooooooo good) So remember the entire lunch sushi and sashimi meal was only $22.50? ?Well it turns out that the one piece of toro alone was $8! ?Eff! ?So I ended up spending an $18 total on 3 extra pieces of sushi. ? =FAIL #2 The food is awesome enough, but the service deserves much praise. ?It's almost as if the servers can see into the future and or read your mind. ?Anything you need will be entertained with immediate attention. ? Exceptional food and service... definitely one of the best meals I've had in my life. ?If Yelp would let me, I'd give this place 10 stars!

My hubby and I brought one of my out-of-town friends who was visiting NYC from Asia here last night. I had told her that this place had a 28 rating on Zagats and set up her expectations high but boy were we disappointed! All three of us ordered the sushi matsu and a couple of side dishes. The fish was fresh but the pieces were small and the sushi just tasted mediocre. My husband and I have traveled to Japan several times and so has my friend so we all felt that this place did not deserve such high ratings. Moreover, we felt rushed the whole time and even though we got there around 8PM, they had already ran out of both salmon roll and king salmon roll. The orange clam sushi was also so fishy that none of us wanted to eat the 2nd piece. To sum it up, this place does not live up to they hype. Would rather go to Takahachi or Sushi of Garu next time for good sushi.

Amazing sushi. ?Probably the best in the city. ?I go back all the time. ? The fish is incredibly fresh. ?Go for the chef's selection or omakase. The wait staff is very professional and attentive. ?The language barrier may pose problems. ? Clean, simple decor.

Extremely fresh, tasty sushi. After visiting many sushi bars this is on of my favorites. Make sure you sit by the sushi bar and get some interaction time with the chef. Most of these guys have 20+ years of experience cutting fish in Japan and will provide great insight on each fish and how it is supposed to be consumed. Two thumbs up.

Delicious sushi! I went on a date here for lunch and we just got the chef's special because we figured we couldn't go wrong. It was great! I tried things I wouldn't normally try, and I loved almost everything. Only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the sea urchin, but that's just not my cup of tea in general. The atmosphere isn't really my type of place, but I still had a great time.

A bit pretentious. ?I would've given 4 stars for the quality of fish (they're alright but were lacking of the snappiness), but am subtracting another due to the size of the pieces. ?They're TINY. ?Complaining about size of sushi sounds a bit funny but it directly links with the value. ?Looking at the plate that they brought out, to think that this is what I got for what I paid, it's frustrating to say the least.

Just went back here for my third visit and I must say that the fish is still sublime and the service attentive and impeccable (mostly). Recently had an issue as we tried to pay with American Express gift cards and our new $200 gift card could not be run for some reason, and the very rude, shaggy haired manager would not give me a moment that I asked for so I could call up Amex to see why there was a problem, so we ended up having to pay $300 that we didn't plan on after they ran the other $150 gift card with no problem. We also had a more inexperienced sushi chef as he asked the more experienced chef next to him how to cut certain pieces. The waitress also kept my husband waiting 10 minutes for a beer, so we assumed she had forgotten. So, the fish is still incredible, but they have lost a star due to service. I was so upset after the gift card debacle that I will not return next year and will instead spend $450 at another of Manhattan's sushi restaurants.

Simply put. ?I've had beautiful dishes that resembled sushi, before. ?But, after dining at Sushi Yasuda, I feel as though I've only had sushi once. Ab-so-lute-ly a-maz-ing. As for the time limit. ?It was off-putting in concept. ?But, in reality, we were not rushed, had numerous courses, didn't feel as though we holding the table for a short amount of time upon completing our dining. ?And, yet, we left with 20 minutes to spare. I can't wait to return. ?For food alone, I would probably put this in bottom of my top 10 in nyc.

My favorite Sushi place in Manhattan - and I've tried a lot. It seems I live my life between all too infrequent visits to Sushi Yasuda. I find its on the pricey side but that's probably because I always go omakase (chef's choice) - though a la cart prices don't appear out of control. Their rice is always perfect, fish is as fresh as it gets, and the selection is diverse (e.g.4 or 5 kinds of eel). Nori is perfectly dry - the rolls crackle and break perfectly when you bite into them. Something sublime about the chef handing you a role and you putting it directly in your mouth. Super fresh. ?For most of the omakase experience, no chopsticks and no soy sauce necessary. The chef basically makes sushi for you continuously but at a very friendly pace, and places it on a leaf in front of you just as you are ready for your next bite. You pick it up delicately with your fingers and they provide a finger-wipey-towel thing to keep your fingers clean. They use the perfect amount of soy and wasabe on each piece where applicable, and the pieces are perfectly sized for one medium bite. The 'full' service chef experience really puts the accent on the meal. Wait service is very attentive though i pretty much ignore them and focus on the Sushi chef. ?Another reviewer said they found it Americanized, but I totally disagree. I was in Tokyo last year and visited a lot of places and I find Yasuda's approach very authentic. If you are a serious sushi enthusiast the best part about this place is you get Kuruma Zushi level quality for a fraction of the price (albeit still costly), so the value on the high end is definitely there. I sometimes see people eating their lunch at Yasuda who completely miss the experience. Oh well, their loss! It usually takes me a day or two to get over the Sushi experience here, getting hungry just writing the review! Yum.

The fish was pretty fresh except for some very dry unagi that was overcooked. Some remarkable fish here, but the service was rushed. Our chef was a gentleman and very helpful in describing the different fish. the food was on par for the good sushi you can get in the city, but 3 stars for the not so impressive service.

The best sushi, I ever had. The first time I ate here I didn't sit at the sushi bar; my mistake! Eating sushi prepared by Chef Yasuda was delicious. The soy coating the fish made the sushi even more juicy than just sitting at one of the tables throughout the restaurant. The sushi here is so fresh, it melts in your mouth. I get the omakase (let the chef choose). You can't really go wrong there unless you're squeemish about some raw foods, in which you can just tell them what you don't want. As I write this review, I'm craving some of their sushi. But its a steep price to fill you up because as they hand you 1 piece of sushi it feels like air in your stomach. Well worth it for a splurge. If you don't want to splurge, theres also a prix fixe for around 22 dollars with a lesser selection of sushi.

If you like sushi and don't mind paying for quality, this is IT! I am a firm believer in quality of rice and quantity ratio between rice/fish is what separates a great sushi from mediocre. ?Sushi Yasuda's rice and rice/fish portion is PERFECT. ?Yes, their otoro and hamachi hara melts like there's no tomorrow in the mouth but still think rice is the centerpiece here. ? Last but not the least, I really like their use of wood in the restaurant. ?Just great overall mood/vibe in that place. ? I don't recall seeing California rolls and dragon rolls in the menu. ?If you are looking for that stuff, there are plenty of great places for those rolls. ?Not here...

sat at the bar which was bittersweet. ?got to ask chef questions at will and got to watch how the seafood was prepared. ?however, it was a little distracting at times. ?meaning, IMO, the bar is more for friends and couples who are well into their friend/relation-ship. ?If you're on a first date, i'd recommend sitting at a table and engage in each other. ? now onto the important stuff --- the fish was so fresh! ?it was recommended to me and i to you that you chose to entree sushi or sashimi/sushi. ? well priced. ?only ~$25 per entree. ?the most exotic fish i tried was the scollop guts!! ?i don't really know what that means haha but it was surprisingly good!!! ?i would order it again. ?eaters beware, it looks like guts. ;) so i'll have to mention that i got a disappointing look and comment when i was dipping my sashimi lightly into the wrong soy sauce. ?it was said by the chef w/good intentions and i'm glad he told me - but yea, i heard that they get 'offended' when you don't do prepare/eat the dish in its intented way... ? overall, def one on my top 5 resto's list

I recently returned from a trip to Japan including the famous Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo. ?This place definitely reminded me of Tokyo and the Tsukiji area restaurant we ate at there. ?The fish was fresh, silky and melt-in-your-mouth. ?The green tea did not come from a tea bag. ?I liked the decor, simple and clean. ?Yes, it is more expensive than your average sushi restaurant, though not horrible by any means unless you are in a splurging sort of mood (of course portions are a bit smaller than your average Americanized sushi spot too). ?The rice is good. ?NB: the wasabi is already on the fish so you don't need to add extra to the soy sauce. ? This place was hopping...I got there around 5:45pm and my party of three got the first table without having a reservation. ?By 6:15pm the entire place was full (not sure if this is because it is more of an after work type of place being in midtown or if it is that full all night). ?The service was good though left me feeling a bit awkward for whatever reason. ?I do kind of wish that there was a bit more inventiveness at this restaurant -- the sushi is fantastic, but sometimes I want something unique that I haven't tried before, some inventive roll or appetizer or something like that. ?This place is straight-up traditional.

It is hard to go back to mediocre sushi after tasting the wonderful works of art at this restaurant~ (unless you live in financial district like me and have no choice when you want to get your sushi fix). ?Every piece is so delightful because the fish is so fresh and melts in your mouth- the rice under the fish is also fantastic in its own right. ?The whole package is just real high quality work. ?I have tasted some great sushi in Tokyo and I would say this place is quite comparable. ?I also prefer the sushi here over Blue Ribbon, which is also very good, but is a little too buttery and rich for my taste. Whenever my family is in town, they always ask me to make a reservation for this place, which by the way is essential, since this place always seems booked.

Finally tried this upscale sushi restaurant the other day. ?I tried the 12 piece set. ?Their sushi were very small compare to many other NYC sushi places. ?Fish was fresh, but fish to rice ratio wasn't good for me. ?I need more fish for their piece of sushi rice portion. ?My stomach definitely wasn't filled for $36 plus tax & tip I paid for 12 pieces and one half roll of sushi. ?It just wasn't impressive for me. ?I prefer mouth filling & watering bigger piece of fish sushi at Tomoe than here. ?I came into conclusion that this kind of midtown suit&tie higher end high class sushi place isn't for me. ?I must be a lower class / no class / or second class, but I just don't see value in those sushi places (because their sushi tend to be smaller and more expensive). ? Their egg custard was ridiculously cold. ?Also, the master sushi chef was yelling and swearing at a younger sushi chef often. ?It was such a turn off. ?I don't want to pay a good chunk of money and eat in front of this kind of scolding drama. ? When I came back home, I got a terrible stomach ache and diarea. ?It was really bad. ?I don't think I will go back there unless somebody pays for the meal. ?I will stay with Tomoe Sushi as my go to sushi place. ?Personally, I think this place is overrated, or it just isn't my taste. It's the Economy, stupid! That's why their sushi is so small. ?You are paying for their decor and rent too. ?In contrast, places like Tomoe Sushi gives you more fish for your $$$ because their decor is minimal and rent / lease / maintenance is much lower.

Service was excellent. We were seated punctually. The waiter was attentive. Only knock would be his incomplete grasp of English prevented him from delivering detailed recommendations or detail with our Omakase. The fish was as good as you'll find in NYC. Highlighted by, possibly, the best Uni I've ever eaten. For those who love fusion rolls and anglicized sushi, don't bother. Truly a fish lovers haven. One surprise, even for a mid-town restaurant, we were the last couple in the restaurant though our reservation was at 930 and dinner was quick. I was also pleasantly surprised when the bill arrived. The meal was not nearly as expensive as I'd been told. I found it to be, actually, quite reasonable for the quality.

Sushi Yasuda is outstanding. ?I suppose it sounds trite, but it really is the best sushi I've ever had. ?Even the routine dishes -- miso soup ?with fish bone ?stock -- were outstanding. ?And the sushi itself was just perfect in every way imaginable -- the cut, the blends, the soy sauce, the rice. ?All outstanding. ?If I had unlimited cash, I would eat here constantly. ?The decor was reserved and pleasant. ? The atmosphere low key, but hip and fun. ?I understand the other comments about the somewhat obsessive reservations policy. ?In my case, I think they called three times to confirm the reservation and provide me with the special numerical code to confirm my reservation. ?Once we arrived, though, the host and staff were very welcoming and accommodating. ?They took our coats and led us to a cozy table in the rear of the restaurant. ?When ?I asked for a sake suggestion, the waitress recommended an exclusive sake available for a limited period on their menu. ?I was a little reluctant to buy it since I didn't quite know whether it was just an upsell scam or something truly worth trying, but I figured why not. ?I was so glad I did. ?Wow. ?This was true throughout the menu. ?When something was listed as a special, it was, in fact, special and not just due to a massive overpurchase on a product. ?I don't give five stars lightly, but Sushi Yasuda definitely earned it.

Underwhelmed. Disappointed. Chef Yasuda's absence has definitely made a negative impact on the restaurant. Chef Yasuda is known for his rice skills, which he often quoted saying that "it takes 7 years to perfect the skills for making great sushi rice." Today's experience made us feel that they needed a few more years of training. The rice was too cold and it lacked flavor. Also, out of our 17 pieces of nigiri, we only enjoyed 4. Some of our fish were cut too thin that we couldn't taste the fish. Our Oh-toro piece was too fishy. The unagi kuro was doused with unagi sauce that it was too sweet to enjoy. The worst piece of the night was our over seared hair tail. We're still trying to figure out why they added it to our Omakase set. Tonight's visit might be our last, unless Chef Yasuda decides to return.

Nothing ground-breaking to report here except that I agree it is one of the best pure sushi joints in the city. We expected to be disappointed b/c of many rave reviews, I always feel I'll be the one to hit it on a bad night. ?It was my partner's birthday too, and I really didn't want her to be let down either. ?We ended up being totally satisfied with the experience, despite the foul-mouthed expense-account I-bankers sitting next to us (frat days never ended for them). ? Haven't had toro in ages, even though i ask for it everywhere I go, and voile, they had it and it was the perfect kind of toro that melts on your tongue like butter. ?i not a hokkigai kind of guy, but i decided to try one of my least faves to see how that stacked up, and the orange clam was amazing, so tender. ?the tekka maki was sublimely beautiful as well. even with sake and a second round of sushi, i felt like it was a pretty good deal for a high end japanese place, esp. in midtown. ?everything was top notch, even the green tea mochi, some of the best mochi i've ever had. we walked out filled and happy. ? the service was fine, they didn't even rush us to leave. ?perhaps early in the week is best to avoid the rushed feeling.

Last nite was the 2nd time that I've been to Sushi Yasuda... The 1st time i was there, I was sitting at the regular table far away from the sushi bar and the food was already amazing, but this time my experience was a little different and even more amazing... I made a reservation at the sushi bar and i got to sit in front of Chef Yasuda... san... He serves my wife and i fish that i have never had... even the scallop guts were sweet.. Yasuda san said that the scallop guts only available for 3 months in a yr... the oysters were so fresh... taste of the ocean... he said they are from washington state... uni tasty as always... and my favorite fish in sushi... mackerel... the taste of fish... i can only say WOW...

I love Ushiwakamaru and Sushi Yasuda is up there (though still not better). This place is a bit expensive but most of it is worth the price. The oyster sushi was AMAZING. They introduced me to Kuchiko, a type of clam that is a cross between Uni and oyster in taste, which is now a favorite. All the sushi was excellent, except for the whitefish that tasted like nothing. The interior of Yasuda could be better - they could easily fit more tables in there and even though they don't need to, they should because the floor looks so weird and bare. The bathroom needs a lot of work... for a place like this, it should be a lot nicer than the green painted walls and odd mirror placements. One thing that I was really taken aback by was the awkward menu. Each dinner set (eg. the matsu or ?the combos) has a different selection of fish you can choose from. We had to ask the waiter about each one for him to give us these little paper forms so we can decide which one we wanted. That is so confusing and annoying! Plus the a la carte menu has some names on there that aren't translated and our server wasn't very good at explaining what they were, which made reading the menu feel like doing research. Basically, service was just not that great. At the end of the day, I just want to go to a restaurant, relax and have good food. I didn't expect to have to do so much work to figure out what is what on the menu (and be given additional mini-menus after having to ask several times), but now that I know, I'll go back on a day when I have more energy.

We went here for my boyfriend's birthday, and it was AMAZING. We specifically reserved a spot in front of Yasuda, and we let him choreograph our dinner. Not a mistake, although I definitely don't recommend the sea urchin. It might be the best in the country but it still tasted like sand... The cuts of fish were absolutely perfect, sliced thin and lightly seasoned with wasabi and shoyu, to the point where no more was necessary, and I could just enjoy the texture and flavor of the fish. Bill for 2 people, for whatever it was that he kept putting in front of us, was $465. Not cheap, but a special, once-in-a-lifetime treat that I feel privileged to have experienced.

Best. Birthday. Dinner. Ever. Sushi Yasuda is a little pricey, but it was totally worth it for my birthday celebration for two. My boyfriend and I got reservations a week in advance, and much to our delight, we were seated in Chef Yasuda's section! We decided to take his suggestion of the sushi for two, which consisted of 8 pieces per person, I believe. It was amazing. He asked us what kinds of fish we liked, and when we told him, he created a sushi feast surrounding our love of salmon and yellowtail. We were told about each fish and where it came from, as well as the rice and the special way he prepares rice at the restaurant. It was not only fascinating, it was pure divine heaven in the form of raw fish. We were so ecstatic that we ordered another round of sushi for two! We definitely waddled home after dinner, but it was so worth it. I don't know the next time there will be an occasion big enough to spend that much on dinner, but I every time that I mention my birthday or think about sushi, wonderful memories spring to mind about my delicious adventure at Sushi Yasuda.

If you care for not fresh, bland, and lingering aftertaste sushi then this is the place for you. Otherwise, head to your nearst Japanese supermarkets to grab a nigri combo. At least they don't mess up unagi and make it taste like a cardboard. Bonus pts for the decor and host though.

I had high expectations going into Sushi Yasuda for lunch on my last day in NYC. ?A trusted foodie friend said Sushi Yasuda was the best sushi she's had outside of the fish market in Japan. ?I was expecting awesomeness! Lunch buddy L and I arrived well before our reservations for fear of being late and losing our reservations. ?L didn't specify that we preferred to sit at the bar when she made the reservations so we were seated at a table closest to the restrooms. ?Upon being seated, I was overcome by the stench of stale urine. ?It was pretty repulsive and headache-inducing. ? I really didn't want to spend big bucks for sushi and not be able to enjoy it because of this nastiness but we had no choice because the place got packed within a few minutes. ?But to my pleasant surprise, the stench went away or maybe I just got used to it? ?gross. On to the food.... we got the sashimi and sushi omakase. ?The sashimi plate came out and I was so excited to thoroughly enjoy each delectable piece of raw fish. ?We were so incredibly underwhelmed by the sashimi. ?Sushi proved to be much better, but nothing spectacular and life-changing. ?I have to say, though, that the unagi was mind-blowing! ?I usually don't like the texture and taste of unagi but this one was just perfectly marinated, seasoned and cooked. ?Friend L and I agreed that we should have just gotten the sushi omakase. ? The bill came out to be about $70 per person. ?We were expecting to pay much more so that made us not feel so bad about having mediocre sushi.

Sushi Yasuda was as good as I had hoped. ?Pretty solid fish, with outstanding rice. ?We had lunch with Yasuda-san and it was great. ?As I recall, we had about 15-20 pieces and it was only $116/pp (and with a considerable amount of toro/uni). ?I thought it to be quite the value, everything considered. ?I especially love the tuna/toro tastings. ?My sole complaint is the weak sake list, although the sake they do have is very cheap compared to other beverages. ?Still, a place as good as this should have a sake list which reflects the same. ?I eat a lot of sushi and we were served things I'd never had before like scallop himo. ?If I lived in NYC, I'd be here every week at least!

My wife and I sat at the bar and got the omekase. ?We got everything on the reccomended list and got seconds of the california sea urchin; fatty tuna; and giant clam himo. ?Other notable mentions were the NZ king salmon; and yellow tail variety. ?Ended up getting about 50+ pieces between the 2 of us. ?Chef was super; and taught us a couple of things about the roe and the grade of seaweed they use. ?Easily the best sushi we've had and we've been to Sasabune; Nobu; Azabu; ushiwakamaru etc. If you want the best experience at places like this you need to sit at the bar and bring lot's of money and be willing to spend it. ?Otherwise, you'll feel like you got ripped off. For us, it was way cheaper than having to fly to tsukiji market in Tokyo.

My friend and I got there 15 minutes early for our table reservation. ?We also saw a couple get sent away because they were half an hour early. ?It's understandable because there is no space to wait unobtrusively. ?Don't get there more than 10-15 minutes early, it's better to be just on time. ? We ordered the omakase (made by Chef Yasuda, I think); I can see why it's so highly recommended. ?The table next to us ordered some other items off the regular menu which looked equally good, but I was too full to try anything else. ?The fish was fresh and good, nice and fatty. ?Service was excellent, even though they were busy. My only complaint is that some of the sashimi was cut slightly sloppy, but that's a negligible concern considering that it still tasted good.

This is some of the freshest sushi I've ever had (even compared to what I used to get when I lived in the San Francisco area). ?The menu is traditional (I only paid attention to the sushi so I can't speak to the rest of the menu) so you're not going to find fancy rolls but don't let that stop you, the simple pure flavor of the fish takes the spotlight. ?The mixed seaweed salad and its dressing was refreshing and an excellent start to the meal. ?The toro rolll (get it with the scallions!) was phenomenal (we had to order a 2nd roll), the hamachi, white king salmon and the eel were spectacular. ?The big surprise was the spanish mackeral, which I don't normally like, but my husband ordered it and convinced me to try it, it melted in my mouth like butter. ? Service was great. ?The ambiance was modern and nice. You have to make reservations a couple weeks ahead of time, so worth it!

Once you taste the sushi here, you will be spoiled for life. ?Seriously. You have to make reservations for lunch and it is always crowded. ?We slip in once in a while because we get there when they open and sit at the sushi bar, promising to be out before the reserved guests arrive. We generally do not sit at the sushi bar, but I think it's the best seat in this restaurant: the sushi chefs are amazingly knowledgeable about suggesting sushi/rolls to you based on your likes/dislikes. ?And *do* listen to them because they will not steer your wrong. The menu is unusual because they only list the fish that are available that day. ?And the tastiest fish, ever. ?All other sushi restaurants pale in comparison. Service is very efficient: they have roving runners who immediately clear your table as soon as you finish your meal, refill drinks, etc. Sushi Yasuda is not cheap, but worth every penny.

I'm not sure why this place gets so much hype...

Probably one of the BEST sushi places I've ever been to in the US. I sat at the counter and ordered omakase which is the chef's choice menu. ? Sure it's NYC so it's gonna cost a little and for me it was about $150 per person without drinks. ? But the fish they use is fresh. ?Some of the fish is imported directly from Japan. ?Most of the Sushi I had was Nigiri which is the traditional way of having sushi. most of the nigiri comes pre flavored with nikiri soy sauce or salt so no need to use a soy sauce. ?THey have an awesome Tuna with a Tofu Dressing Sauce, Salmon with a tempura tomato on top, Sawara with a mixed mushroom sauce on top... ?I probably had about 15 pieces in total. ?Every bite I had was just straight awesome. ? I'm not sure how the experience is at the regular table but when I eat sushi I try to sit on the counter to get the best experience possible. ?This time I had the pleasure to sit in front of Mr. Aoki which is the executive chef. ?He's real quite but polite. ? The way he makes all the Nigiri Sushi is real polite to. ?All I gotta say is Beautiful pieces of artwork leave his station every time. ? Thank you. ?I will be back when I'm in NYC!!!!!!

made reservations at the bar in front of master yasuda. ?this is a sushi purist shrine, and i now understand why it's among the best sushi in the US. ?not only is the fish fresh with a lot of variety (including unusual stuff), he pairs it with the perfect rice, fish to rice proportion, temperature, wasabi amount, and brushed soy. ?a key portion to the unique experience however, is his passion. ?he loves educating you about fish in general, seasonality, various types, farm vs wild, etc and proper sushi etiquette of course -- almost like a sushi missionary. i recommend sushi tastings, so that you can learn the differences among various fish in 1 sitting. ?price per piece $4-7 for example, we started with tuna tasting *blue fin tuna, then big eye tuna, followed with chu toro and o toro this really helped contrast the textures and the fattiness after that, turned to salmon -- king trio *white king salmon, alaskan king salmon, and new zealand king salmon also since it was the start of the season -- coho salmon here you can really differentiate farm vs. wild, whereas the farm raised was much softer and meltier, the wild was more sinewy. ?it's kind of interesting then, that not swimming thousands of miles in the farm makes the fish fat, soft, and lighter color and actually preferred by many next did a hamachi tasting *warasa, hiramasa, shimaaji when was the last time your sushi chef was talking about amino acids and fish color? ?yasuda is very passionate he was also an eel chef, so we went for eel trio tasting *sawani -- fresh white sea eel with a simple salt lemon prep *anago -- fresh dark sea eel with a classic sweet soy prep *shirayaki -- fresh white freshwater eel with another great brushed sauce; i loved all 3, complexity of flavority i had not tried before (unagi is prepared dark freshwater eel) i also tried sanma (mackerel type) and had his ankimo (ponzu but no special prep) unfortunately that day he only had california uni, thus did not try his clam selection is also notable overall, the ambiance is also cool, bright wood paneling fitting of a place of simplicity and precision this was definitely the best meal of my nyc trip.

Sushi Yasuda is the Taj Mahal of sushi. ?Reservations are hard to come by, so we took the first time slot available. ?We went for a friend's birthday and went with the omakase (chef's choice). ?We sat back as plate after plate of amazing sushi came out. ?The server named each piece like a zoology lesson and we slowly savored each piece like New York Times food critics (discussing the viscosity of each fish, followed by grunts). ?The toro (fatty tuna) melted in our mouths like butter, we had multiple varieties of mackeral / yellowtail (who knew their were up to 7 different varieties of each), tried the arctic char and uni, and ordered more eel like Henry VIII. ?The rice is like no other and the chef adds soy sauce and wasabi to each piece (putting wasabi into soy sauce is a cardinal sin there). ?This place isn't for the sushi newbie - you might be thrown out like the Soup Nazi for ordering a California Roll or Shrimp Tempura. ?You should go in with an open mind and wallet (it isn't cheap, but well worth it for their mastery, knowledge, and overall religious experience).

I will never visit this restaurant again. I have been before and the food is definitely worth every penny, but today I called to see if I could get a reservation for lunch and they said that there are tables for walk ins and that I should come right away. After I rushed over in 10 minutes, the host was extremely rude, telling me that there were no tables available and that I was the one who misunderstood. Perhaps there was a miscommunication, but after rushing over there to be told it was my fault, I realized I just don't want it that bad and would never give my money to a business run like this. Honestly, there is good sushi all over NYC, and I will never go to Yasuda again. Try Inase on the UES for exceptionally fresh sushi and excellent service.

I may need a second job because since discovering Sushi Yasuda, I have to get takeout from here for lunch.

Real sushi here. None of that roll business. Good quality sushi, but our waiter and waitress (she was more like his little helper) made us uncomfortable. The waiter was on some sort of power trip. One of the items I ordered was the tamago. He kept asking me if I wanted a tamago sashimi. I was confused since tamago is essentially a small egg omelette! I kept telling him I just wanted the tamago, but he kept asking me if I wanted it sashimi style. It went on like this for a bit and he even asked if I was familiar with sushi!? WTF? Of all the dozens and dozens of sushi places I've been to, I've never been told my egg sushi would be sashimi! Somehow, we finally came to an understanding. I don't know how. I guess sashimi style means the egg doesn't come with the rice. They also have a interesting, but unsettling habit of turning your bowls and cups a certain way until they are satisfied even as you are eating/drinking. I've been to Japan many times and have never experienced this much OCD fanaticism.

Great overall, but still not as good as Sushiann, imo. The sushi pieces were bitesized, just the way I like em, beautifully presented (rounder than your typical sushi) and extremely fresh. We shared the seaweed salad and ordered various ala carte items. they had 5 different kinds of tuna ranging from maguro thru fatty tuna, I ordered 3 of the 5 (I like thru medium fatty but not fatty tuna), Maine uni (trying to minimize the carbon footprint vs the Cali uni), anago, kanpachi, shima aji, spanish mackerel. service was excellent. Their green tea and hoji cha are delicious. My only gripe would be the "hectic" feel of the place. since it's very popular and always busy, they give you 1h 15m limit on reservations. Plenty of time for a quick lunch, but not for dinner. The acoustics are not too good because everything is made of wood, including the walls and there's no carpeting so sound bounces everywhere. added to the hectic feel. Would definitely go back for lunch. The people were extremely nice, professional and all Japanese! Yasuda is my second favorite sushi place in NYC next to Sushi-Ann.

Food: ***** Space: ***** Value: **** Service: a bit "too" prompt, because they want you to leave earlier. The moment you put down your chopsticks they take your plate. Which is not really a bad thing. Just that it's not a cheap restaurant, I usually get to enjoy the environment and good time with my friends more while paying so much. They set lots of restriction in terms of reservation. You gotta follow "their timing". When sushi yasuda tell you you can only come at 6pm you basically have no other choice, even I am looking at their reservation book and it's still blank on that Friday still a month away. You have to call them to confirm by yourself, and you have to finish your meal within 1.5 hour (so the table can have as many turn arounds as possible). I am not saying all these are bad, maybe I still can't adjust myself from the Paris trip, where I could sit at a restaurant the whole night without being rushed, and you are not obligated to pay tip, only pay as you wish.

Great sushi dinner, one of the best I've had in New York. The service is great but more importantly the fish is so so so fresh. I'm not sure why it is given $$$$. Yes, it CAN be expensive, but they also have a price fixed dinner of 5 pieces of sushi and 2 rolls for just over $20, that's a pretty great deal for me. Highly recommended, definitely go here!

The place to go for perfectly fresh traditional sushi and sashimi. You really can't get better than Yasuda if you just want a good solid meal of well made sushi with no extras.

I came here on a recommendation by a Japanese friend. ?They have a very good value dinner pre-fix for around $22. ?Since it was my first time, I decided to do the pre-fix. ?The servers were polite, efficient and no nonsense. ?I ordered the sushi & sashimi combination dinner with asahi super-dry draft. ?The food portions were tiny, in a true Japanese style. ?The quality of the fish were superb. ?The mini sashimi pieces melted in my mouth. ?I ate them with my eyes closed. ?I also had a roll of artic char sushi that was smooth and so delicate in flavor. ?I decided to order one extra piece of sea urchin sushi, which was wonderful and brought back memories of my childhood seaside dinners in Korea. ?I had green tea mochi ice cream for dessert. ?I think the small portions and high quality fish make the experience more enjoyable somehow. ?The restaurant decor is decent, not fancy. ?The outside of the restaurant doesn't even have a sign. ?I think this is a strategy. ? If you want to feel full after seafood dinner, I recommend going to city island. ?If your focus is on good sushi, then this place is worth a try. ?I'll try a la carte dinner next time.

Yasuda is my favorite sushi restaurant in NY. ?The sushi is always rolled delicately in small pieces. ?They have a large selection of fresh fish. ?I had a white salmon that just melted in my mouth. ?Everything else I have had here has always been excellent. ?If it wasn't for the soup nazi-ish reservation system and tiny bit rude attitude, I would have given it a five star.

Impeccably fresh fish. There are few restaurants in this city that offers comparable quality. On the other hand, the minimalist decor and at times erratic service prevent a truly exceptional dining experience. There's something cold and impersonal about the restaurant on the whole. It's definitely a must try for sushi connoisseurs, but I'm still on the look out for a restaurant with similar quality in sushi and a more well-rounded dining experience.

Sushi Yasuda is amazing. ?Great sushi and great service. ?Omakase with Chef Yasuda is a treat. ?He knows his sushi. ?He's a purist and doesn't serve inside out rolls or spicy anything rolls- Yasuda said that's not real sushi. ?Definitely my favorite place in NYC for sushi,

I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars! It's amazing. Don't expect fancy, creative rolls here. Just expect the freshest, most delicious tasting sushi you have ever had. Also, the rice is perfect. If you don't feel like spending a lot of money for the omakase, there are other options on the menu, and some of them are super great deals. They have prix fixe options for lunch and dinner that are about $20 for miso soup, chirashi, and mochi ice cream. You can substitute for sushi or sashimi too. They also have a fancier version of chirashi that is more expensive and includes a couple pieces of uni, and I finally understand the hype. It's SO good! The chefs are incredibly nice and knowledgeable. I came here for the first time by myself and sat at the sushi bar and ordered the chirashi without mackerel. The next time I went was a year later, and my sushi chef remembered that I had sat in the same seat last time I was there AND he remembered I didn't like mackerel. I never expected to be treated so well while getting the most inexpensive option! Another thing I recently discovered is that you can get take out orders here. Once I was craving their sushi but knew that it was after they stopped serving lunch, but I called to see if I could get something to go. They said of course and even gave me green tea and mochi (which I wouldn't expect for a take out order). I just wish they were open every day and for lunch on weekends. This review is making me a bit sad that I can't go there for dinner tonight.

Don't get me wrong, sushi is great at this place. I live a block away from the restaurant and I love going for omakase at the bar. What I HATE is the phone reservation person. Every time I call he has an attitude and he talks down to you. I finally decided I'm not going to spend money to support rude and condescending servers. Although not as close and not as convenient for me, I'm taking my business to Ushiwakamaru, where the staff are courteous and pleasant.

We come as regularly as our wallet will allow, this last trip was probably our 7th or so. ?Each time, we ask to sit at the sushi bar and get omakase. ?Sushi is always sublime. ?The rice is slightly warm and perfectly seasoned. ?The most incredible sushi we had were the uni, eel, sea scallop gut, oyster, and ikura. ?The scallop gut (marvelous, like uni) and oyster were both accentuated by sea salt which crunches a bit when you eat it. ?Texturally awesome. ?We also had several tunas of various fattiness levels, giant clam, squid leg, king salmon, atlantic char salmon, king white salmon, fluke, branzino, and an uni hand roll. ?A fun adventure of textures and tastes, all impeccably fresh and delicious. ?We left happily stuffed. ?Together with sake and beer, the damage was $250 before tip for 2 people. ?Can't wait to return!

been here once, the last night before chef yasuda was to retire. i can say i had a very positive experience and i would go back again. the bill was pretty expensive, but the company picked up the tab. sushi pieces are pretty small, which is why the bill came out to so much, but it was pretty good and tasty. this is one of the better sushi places.

If I won the lottery the first thing I would do would be to reserve the sushi bar seat in front of Yasuda himself every single night so I could let him take me on a delicious culinary adventure that I could never tire from! Sushi Yasuda is my favorite restaurant of all time. Everybody who knows me well and probably not so well knows this about me. It is the purist sushi lover's paradise. I literally feel myself float when I eat this sushi. My eyes get glassy and I become high on the food. I have never had that kind of experience from food before nor do I think I will ever have one similar ever again. I go to Yasuda whenever I am back in my native city and my wallet can handle it. I get the omakase and I try so hard to only limit myself to a certain amount but when that time comes and I know I shouldn't allow anymore I break down and continue eating. One more uni, one more ikura, one more, one more...turns out to be a boat load more and I am one step away from having to do dishes in the back to pay for my meal. It is worth it though, oh man is it ever! If ever I am on death row and I am granted one last meal, this is the only thing I will ask for...well only 150 pieces of the most insane, melt in your mouth, make you float, make you wanna slap your mama sushi! mmmmmmm!

OVERRATED. I should just stop there as it sums it up perfectly, but I'd like to mention that the sushi they serve is some of the worst I've ever had. It's actually minced like ground beef, with the contents (fish, meat, etc.) mixed up with the rice so that most of the flavor is lost. Strangest sushi I've ever seen/tasted and an incredible disappointment after all the reviews and making reservations weeks in advance. ?The edamame was nothing special and the miso soup was just bad. Trader Joe's honestly sells better quality miso soup in an envelope, believe it or not. ?I'd like to understand what possesses people to covet this place so highly, but I've long since given up on faith in humanity and especially their tastes in just about anything. Having said that, this 4.5 star rating as well as having to book weeks to months in advance for this lackluster food still manages to boggle the mind.

We sat at a corner booth last night and had the Omakase. It was nice but I was underwhelmed. Likes: King Salmon, Toro, Butterfish, clam. Dislikes: eel, octopus, sea urchin. ?After all the raves abt the Shirayaki, I had high expectations, alas it was not met. ?The service was good and attentive. We had a really nice sake, which was recommended by the waitress. I forgot the name, but it's the first on the menu for cold dry sake. There were many ppl dunkin their sushi in soy sauce at the tables nearby. Not sure if this is the best way to go folks! The 90-mins limit is not a big deal because we were done within 40 mins. If you are ordering wines or cokes, they serve it in small glasses. The couple next to us was really taken aback by this :) The prix fixe sushi options are really limited. I wouldn't order it for dinner, perhaps lunch.. All in all, for the price, I ?had better. Next time, we'll sit at the bar.

As usher would say, OMG! Been here a few times now and everytime we go its consistent. Whether its been on a weds, thurs, or sat night the sushi and the service is the same. The interior is minimalistic, almost like a high end log cabin but it matches well with the food. Its simple and good. No need for the soy sauce or for you Koreans, go choo jang like when you go to other places. Eat it the way its served unless told otherwise and put your chopsticks down and use your fingers. At the sushi bar things are flying by you and before you know it you've had 4 types of tuna and even some rare baby tuna(i kid). But the uni is just WOW!! I have never had uni this delicious. We end up ordering 10 pieces a la carte it seems everytime we go. Presented with just a little sea salt on top, dissolves in your mouth. Just like vapor. Ever have one of those truffles from Maison Du Chocolat? Yeah kinda like that, dare i say better. So definitely try this place out if you havent and try the uni! even if you've never had it or hated it at other places. TrY it! my god man u wont be sorry.

Outstanding - a friend of mine was in from LA and recommended this place. Having been to japan and eaten a lot of sushi in my life, I must say this was the best sushi I have ever had. From the begining, the sake was outstanding ( house special ) and the seaweed salad was like no other, offering four different types, which were not over soaked in some glop. Normally sea urchin is not one of my favorites, but having it here spoiled me from having it anywhere else. Once you have sushi here, not much else can compare!

When I started living in NYC 5 years ago, I lived right across the street from Yasuda and came here all the time (once a week).. after having eaten in many sushi restaurants in Japan, I could def. attest that Yasuda's quality was on par with many of the top places in Japan. Sadly, it seems that Yasuda's quality has deteriorated recently, most notably this year. There were several times this year when I got a piece of fish that tasted very fishy. I've also noticed a higher than expected turnover..while restaurant turnover is completely normal, I remember that I used to see new trainees working behind other sushi chefs (rather than serving sushi up front as a sushi chef), and were required to work for the chefs for much longer before being promoted. Now it seems that more and more of the faces that I see at the sushi counter are new. The experience for me has changed, perhaps because I miss walking into a restaurant and sitting in front of my favorite chef...perhaps because the restaurant just feels very cold and corporate, or perhaps the quality just isn't on par with what it once was.

I absolutely worship this place. If this were to be my last meal on earth, I would die a happy gal. It's hands down the best sushi in New York City and possibly outside of Japan. Super fresh, with a lot of variety of different fish and super authentic. There is nothing gimicky about this sushi restaurant. Mr. Yasuda's ethic is to keep it simple. No crazy rolls here or fusion foods. Just simple, beautiful fish and a few delicate appetizers. Don't dip your sushi in soy sauce if you can help it. The chefs brush them with soy and/or salt them lightly with fleur de sel so each bite is superb - a yummy, melt-in-your-mouth creaminess that is to die for! Also, don't put too much wasabi in your soy sauce! It is frowned upon because the chefs already place a small dab of wasabi on each piece, and that is more than enough. They also brew their own soy sauce here, which is what the pros do in Japan. The menu is constantly changing as well, because if Mr. Yasuda can't get the freshest fish flown over from all around the globe, then he doesn't put it on the menu. Expect to choose from at least 5 different kinds of tuna, NOT including toro (tuna belly - food from the gods!), half a dozen different types of yellowtail, and so much other fish that you probably have never heard of. Highly recommend the uni (sea urchin) here, as well as the toro scallion handrolls. I can eat 10 of them, they're so damn good. The nori here is always crisp, always fragrant, and has that perfect CRUNCH to it when you bite into it. The rice here is always perfect as well - good sushi rice is neither warm nor cold, and it is much less sticky than 90% of the restaurants make it. Learning how to master the art of cooking sushi rice takes years in Japan, and it shows at Sushi Yasuda. When making reservations, always ask to sit at the sushi bar with Mr. Yasuda (although he doesn't come in on Saturdays). LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. ?Much better than sushi at Masa, by the way.

OMG..the fish..they were all so good..It was like Sushi heaven.. ?There were so many different kinds of eel, yellowtail, salmon, etc that you wouldn't find in most sushi restaurants. ?I didn't want the sushi experience to end. Everything I've had was amazing. ?Thumbs up the best sushi restaurant I've ever been to.

A sublime sushi experience. The white eel was perfectly presented and dissolved in my mouth like candy. This is the finest sushi I've had in the last five years. Can't wait to go back.

I've been going to Sushi Yasuda for years, often sitting at Chef Yasuda's corner for what was absolutely the best sushi on earth. Now Chef Yasuda has gone on to another venture -- and the restaurant that bears his name is not adhering to his standards. I ate there last night. The sushi is nothing better than ordinary. Some of the pieces (uni, oyster, and squid legs) were well past their prime. The rice was substandard. Service too has declined. Orders were botched and brought out piecemeal. It was really heartbreaking to see a place that I had loved so much decline so rapidly without its master chef. Oh well.

First off...i got a recommendation to eat here from my friends who said i MUST try this sushi restaurant. i took my chic there expecting to knock her socks off but was EXTREMELY disappointed. The meat was the only thing this place has going for it....the people there are snooty people and they need to get their head out of the clouds....who gives a darn how the name of the fish is pronounced...if it tastes good it's good...the ambience was weird and the people there made it uncomfortable to just enjoy the food. I felt like i was in a nightmare...i had all the money to blow an empty stomach and sushi that came out ONE piece of fish and rice every 10 minutes...a bad dream.....if the food came out together and if the focus wasn't on the fish but on 'enjoying the fish' i would have enjoyed it a lot more. If you do decide to eat here, bring a date to show off and be sure to eat a whopper jr. before you go so youre not actually hungry and you can act cool.

This was our second time at Yasuda, and I left stunned at the overpriced, overrated sushi. ?We ordered the omakase ($120 per person) and were served TEN pieces of sushi each. ?Absurdly thin fillets of fish over disprioportionately big sushi rice. ?I have enjoyed omakase at many places, and this was, by far, the worst. ?The fish was fresh enough, but nothing special. ?The entire omakase was served via two platters: one plate of sashmi, followed by one plate of sushi. ?The chef had not even bothered to divide up the portions between the two diners. ?I have had simple sushi boats better than this. ?We ended up ordering 4 appetizers in the hopes of making up for the paltry omakase, but we still left unsatisfied. ? The bill came out to $300, and we left the restaurant feeling hungry. ?I should also mention that the servers were rude, and rushed us out at the end of the meal, claiming that there were other customers waiting for the table. ?Unbelievable. ?If possible, I would give Yasuda no stars. ?It is overhyped and way overrated.

We had been lucky enough to score a reservation at the sushi counter with Chef Yasuda. I was politely told when I called that they would only hold the reservation for 1o minutes and that we had to leave after 1 1/2 hours. I've read many complaints about this here and on other sites. They are completely upfront about this when you make your reservation so I'm not sure why people get angry or are surprised about it when their time is up. This is a very small restaurant in a very expensive city. They need to turn their tables, its basic economics, if you're not okay with this then you should probably find another place. As it turns out I got caught in cross town traffic and arrived 17 minutes after my reservation time, my friend was waiting, Chef Yasuda was a gentleman. We ordered the Omakase. Chef Yasuda said at the end of the meal that we each had 30 pieces of sushi. I can honestly say I lost count but as I try to remember back to all the varieties of fish, shellfish and rolls we had, each one more amazing than the other, we must have had many more than 30. We gave Chef Yasuda carte blanche to serve us whatever he wanted, no preferences, no restrictions. I think that is the way you get the best experience and the chef appreciates the opportunity. ?I've seen/heard people order Omakase and then follow it with many rules: none of this, extra that, so on; etc. That's not the spirit of Omakase, although if you do have a strong objection to something I'm sure Chef Yasuda will accommodate. In my opinion the fish is properly proportioned to the rice and yes much smaller then some places that drape a hunk of fish over rice. We followed all of Chef Yasuda's suggestions. We only dipped rolls in soy sauce (some once, others twice as suggested), we held our chopstick parallel to the table and did not grab the sushi from above, we never added wasabi. Some pieces we were told to use our hands, we did. We were at the hands of a master and we were there to experience sushi his way. It was sublime. The best sushi experience we ever had. I will regret spending any money on sushi anywhere else from now on. My friend had 4 or 5 sakis (different varieties that chef Yasuda recommended), I had about 6 Kirin drafts. The price, a tad under $500 before tip. ?Expensive, yes. ?Worth it? ?Absolutely. ?By the way, we exceeded our allotted reservation time and we were politely asked by the waitress to start wrapping up our meal. ?A large group of people were gathered by the door.
