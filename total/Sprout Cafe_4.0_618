Love this place. ?This was my first time there and I wasn't disappointed. ?We went around 5pm so it was not too crowded which was nice. ?Its very clean and inviting. ?Great vegetarian choices too. We ordered: Portobella sandwich - my friend loved it. ?It looked amazing and juicy. ?The portobella mushroom was cooked perfectly. ?It came with a side salad as well. Garlic sweet potato fries - OMG....in love with these. ?Bring gum for after because these are garlicky big time. ?Comes with a spicy dipping sauce and ketchup. ?A must if you are eating here. Tofu salad - ordered from the menu since I'm not creative enough to put a slew of salad items together. ?The tofu was fried perfect, the egg cooked amazing, and the ginger soy dressing was awesome. ?It's a huge salad and pretty filling. ?If you are looking for a light snack a half salad would probably be a better portion. Pomegranate sangria - Nice after work relaxer. ?Tasted good, but for $7 it is in a very small wine glass. ?Wish it was a little larger for the price. ? Overall, this place was awesome. ?I will be back for sure...especially for those garlic sweet potato fries! Thanks Sprout Cafe!

The service leaves something to be desired. It's possible I just had bad luck, but when I got takeout here they first didn't know what ingredients their food had, then mixed up our orders and made us wait twice as long, and then gave us spoons for our salads even though we specifically asked for forks. I'm sure the food itself is good, but I can't say because I am UNABLE TO EAT IT. (After eating the food, I'd say it's ok, but not sure why people get so excited about it. It's a pretty generic salad, and their ingredients aren't exciting enough to make up for it)

This used to by far be my favorite lunch spot in Palo Alto, but the past few occasions haven't been worth the overly long lunch-hour line. ?I typically order a custom salad and have raved about the variety of ingredients. ?My absolute favorite add on was the ahi tuna, but the past two visits it was obvious that it had been frozen and possibly freezer burned. ? There are some stellar items on the menu that on occasion I still cave from time to time. ?The Corn Chowder here seriously never fails. ?The Sesame Tofu and the Summer Rolls are items that will no disappoint.

Seriously, the salads here are only OK.. A positive is that they do have a lot of ingredients and portion is large but lack flavor. I haven't tried the sandwiches and not sure if I would come back. I would stick with Plutos.

I went to Sprout Cafe for the first time a few days ago. I built my own salad using the forms they have at the door. My salad with the included ingredients and added chicken and steak came out to $12, plus $4 for a bottle of Anchor Steam. The portion size was larger than I expected and it tasted very good. The downside to building your own salad is that you might not pick the best ingredients to complement each other, but in my case it worked out fine. I'll try one of their salads off the menu next time, but I appreciate being able to customize my order. Some people might balk at paying $10+ for a salad, but you are getting a lot of fresh ingredients, generous portion size and a spacious and inviting location downtown. My order took a bit longer to make than I would have liked given that it wasn't crowded, but that's a minor gripe. I'll be coming back to Sprout.

Seriously the Kyoto salad is an embarrassment of riches and wholly deserving of a great review: generous slices of freshly cracked black pepper encrusted ahi tuna, mixed local greens, wakame seaweed, somen noodles, firm tofu, nori, edamame, carrots, sesame seeds and miso sesame dressing (which I typically get served on the side since the Kyoto is so flavorful it doesn't need any embellishment). Did I mention this salad is gigantic? Because it is and it is so good that you will eat it all. Sprout Cafe gets props for awesome soups as well, I wish such a place would exist in every college town!

OK, so sometimes they don't get the make-your-own salad exactly right. ?But most of the time they do, and the ingredient quality and selection is excellent. ?Any salad with the seared ahi on it is excellent. ?And there are loads of dressing choices as well. ?I would recommend takeout instead of dining in.

Salads are OK- despite having lots of good ingredients they often lack flavor. Sandwiches are good- but be prepared to wait. It takes at least 25 minutes to make a sandwich Sesame tofu bites are AWESOME but also take a long time Lunch time is crazy no matter if you eat in or order ahead. It took them 60 minutes to have 4 salads and 4 sandwiches ready for pick-up :-( Pluto's is better.

Although this is a "build-your-own-salad" type of place (similar to Counter's Burgers), I opted to try one of their pre-selected salads and was very pleased. I got the Kyoto salad ($10.95) and it had peppered crusted ahi tuna, mixed greens, wakame seaweed, somen noodles, firm tofu, nori, edamame, kaiware sprout, carrots, sesame seeds, & miso sesame dressing. I love ahi tuna and I love japanese food, so this was perfect for me. Probably the only rare moments I even eat salads is when they bribe me with ahi tuna :D Ahi was very fresh and they give you nice thick slices of it. They don't skimp out on the portions either. I ordered this salad thinking it would be a nice light snack, but it was more like having a gourmet version of Fresh Choice: filled with lots of goodies and piled high. Does get really crowded during lunch hour and parking can be a pain, so plan accordingly if you want to try this place out. My friend ordered a steak sandwich and he said it was really good too. Perfect little lunch spot for soup, salads and sandwiches.

I can't even imagine what I would do if Sprout Cafe was in my area! I would not have any self control whatsoever because I would go there everyday! I ordered their Kyoto salad: Peppered crusted ahi tuna, mixed greens, wakame seaweed, somen noodles, firm tofu, nori, edamame, kaiware sprout, carrots, sesame seeds, miso sesame dressing. (I substituted mixed greens with spinach!) Seriously. It was the best salad I have ever had! And I have eaten a lot of salads in my lifetime. The highlight of this dish was of course their peppered crusted ahi tuna which was seared to perfection. The portion was generous and I had plenty of leftovers for a snack later on in the day. I know that if I am ever in the area again, I would definitely come back to Sprout!

Note: Review for the salad only. I ordered the large salad, and upon getting my order, I noticed that the salad container was just half full. In fact, as I eyed them putting the other orders together, I realized it was just as much (or little) as a small salad others had ordered. Not really worth $10 - the ingredients are definitely fresh, but for the price I'd go elsewhere. ?I likely will not be going back - at least not for the salad. Related note: I ended up at La Boulange today, and got a substantial club sando (turkey, fresh avocado, bacon) with a quinoa salad for the same price. Two thumbs up.

Let me first say that I've eaten at Sprout Cafe and the food was good. This review is for poor customer service. My wife and I stopped in for dinner at 8:55, walked in and looked at the menu. By the time we were ready to order, it was almost 9:00. The cashier frankly refused to take our order and said, "We close at nine o'clock." This was a bit confusing because the sign on the [open] door actually said they closed at 10 pm and the place was still full of customers. We went across the street instead.

Fresh, tasty salads made the way you like it, even when you pop in just before closing on a weeknight. Dining in seems to be the way to go, if you can spare the time because the setting is pretty nice and the portions seem to tip in favor of those sticking around. Some nice beers available too. My only reservation is about the staff. The folks on display making your meal are all very pleasant and professional, but the last cashier I dealt with was a bit...frosty? Her demeanor might have been enough to frost my beer mug, but hey, it was close to closing. Next time, I'll try to make it in a bit earlier.

A colleague took me to Sprout Cafe, raving about what a great place this is; notwithstanding the prior operational issues he had experienced trying to get his food. Away we went. To start with, my colleague was correct, the place is an organizational mess. People are standing right in front trying to fill out forms, people are waiting in line, and the line for phone/internet order pick up co-mingles with the order line. No one behind the counter seems to know who's on first and they feel understaffed. Next was my order, a salad for $12.37. At one level, this is a fine price for a good lunch. However, for what I received, it was not a great deal. I had steak with my salad, which added $2.95 to the price. When back at the office I opened the salad to find five cubes of meat, virtually raw. Just out of curiosity, I weighed it on our scale, it priced out to a little over $1.50/once for the meat (guess it is extra to get your food cooked). Now the wait, nearly 15 minutes. My colleague ordered his salad right in front of me in line. His came out over five minutes earlier. At least we had the opportunity to play dodge with all the people coming and going. All this would have been alright had the salad been good; it was not. As I sit here and write this review I am picking out things that I did not order (coincidentally, these non-specified items constituted the largest proportion of my extras and minimized the size of my lunch). Also, things I did specify were of poor quality (bacon with mostly fat, onions which included large portions of un-cut center pieces...). Suspect they are moving so quickly to fill orders that mistakes are made. Overall, a poor experience. Will not try again.

Great food, slightly expensive but very healthy! It's in downtown PA, so what do you expect... for two half salads with all the toppings we wanted, it was 22 bucks. The half salads are a good size though.. probably not good if you are starving, but for a light lunch its perfect. The best part about this place- the ordering process! Just grab a clipboard when you walk in and mark all the things you want (similar to The Counter). They also have an already made menu, and i'm sure they are delicious. But being a paleo-friendly eater, I need to make my own :-) Try it out... you won't regret it!

The sandwiches are also really tasty! ?The Chipotle and Salmon Club are my personal favorites. ?What I really like about the sandwiches are some of the creative ways of combining different flavors, like bacon and salmon in the Salmon Club and blueberry and barbecue in the Pulled Pork. ?Very adventurous.

I am having a real problem writing positive reviews of places I love lately, because of some defect or drawback to them that sadly forces me to lower the star ratings. Sprouts Cafe is my new favorite place. ?Let me say that again, I just discovered Sprouts Cafe and it is now my new favorite place. The first problem is that it took me over a year to have the aggressiveness and patience to even enter it and try to figure out how it works or what it is! ?That is really unforgivable and negative for this place who really does have a good idea and executes on it fairly well. You walk in and the first thing you are encounter is a group of people who seem to know just what they are doing huddling around a table filling out paper forms. Then over by the counter you see people in line ordering ... it just confused the hell out of me so many times when I thought I might like to eat there - I just said screw it and went somewhere else. But today, I and my girlfriend bravely ventured in ... even after leaving once ... we came back and tried to see what we could find out. ?We went up to the counter and stood in the line ... that actually moved pretty fast. ?Before we knew it, it was time to order and we had no idea. ?So we were hungry and like tuna and chicken we got a Rocky salad and Tuna Nicoise (sp?) salad and we just drank water. ?It was just over $20. We wandered around and finally found a table ... the place was packed .. and noisy and just chaos, but we sat down and waited. ?A moderate time later a waiter came over with two large bowls of salad with dressing on the side. I don't eat much dressing, and my GF did not like her dressing. ?No worries, we went up and got a different one, for free! The ingredients were healthy, fresh, tasty as all get out, and I just loved it. ?Both salads came with a generous slice of what seemed to be whole wheat bread. ?The bread was good. ?This is the kind of food I like and can never find. ?I am tired of over-processed, over salted, chemically adulterated food, and also just for my health I need to eat like this, and Sprouts makes it a treat! Now, after figuring out how the place works a little bit and having my anxiety lessened and my curiosity piqued, I took a look at their menus. ?It is a build your own salad form. Starting out with a basic ingredient, and then adding on items ... sadly a bit like buying a new car, you can make a custom salad to your liking. ?The idea is great, I'm just afraid of the cost of my dream salad. ?Normally I go over the Whole Foods and throw a little bit of everything from the salad bar into one of their to-go boxes, which are expensive too. So, I am looking forward to figuring out how to maximize the benefit of the idea of a custom salad and keep the cost reasonable as well as I sample their different flagship salads and see what is the best. All in all I am very happy I tried Sprouts and hope to come here much more. I hope that they smooth out their process and make it more personal, a bit friendlier and more comfortable ( the seats and tables are fairly spartan ). ?Maybe they are doing so well they do not care to look at how they can improve, but they could be better if only in not scaring off potential customers with so much noise and chaos. To me Sprouts is a bit expensive, but balance that with the cost of buying all that produce, preparing it, washing it and then cleaning up and it works out to be an overall win for me and I am happy I discovered this place - I'd love to give it a 5/5 stars! PS, they had some kind of wifi, but I could not really get it to do anything it was so slow.

The food was fresh but the whole place has a cold unwelcome feel to it. I enjoyed my crusted tofu salad, though a little overpriced at $10 considering all the other ingredients were pretty cheap. The service is probably why I'll think twice about going back--they forgot my order and when I asked for it long after those in my party had gotten their food, they were unapologetic in returning it. Maybe next time will be better.

Thank you, Katherine A. for telling me about this place! Picture a very high-end Pluto's. ? I wanted a salad very badly this past Saturday but felt like I would be cheating on my love (the sandwich) because for one, the sandwiches are cheaper and two, I just got to have a sandwich. ?Yes, my choice of carbs have always been and will always be: bread. ? You can order their salad or custom build it (w/ their menu/card thingy). ?I got the Croque Monsieur (grilled ham, gruyere cheese, on a acme pain de mie). ?I started to LOVE pain de mie after my run at Grilled Cheese Bandits. ?The sandwich is very simple yet so elegant at the same time. ?The presentation went well w/ the ambiance and the entire atmosphere on University Ave. ?I chose a table outside to embrace the wonderful weather we were having. ? I swear, next time I will order a sandwich AND a salad.

Instant noodles vs. salad Instant noodles OP In the summer I was a lazy kid who would wake up at 1pm on weekends and go to downtown Palo Alto for lunch. One day I decided to be healthy and eat a salad out. Gigantic mistake. I ended up underwhelmed and ironically I ended up eating the junkiest of junk foods, ramen, to make up for it. I got a custom salad, but it felt just like one I made every day at my college dorm - the one that's usually a third of my meal, not a $11.80 entree. Sure it had some salmon topped in, basically had no flavor or taste and was surprisingly mouth drying at the same time. And salmon is even one of those $4 premium toppings. Also the salad wasn't mixed properly, I had to eat at least a fourth of it before I found my first kernel of corn. It was all lumped together in one corner. Tossing salads is not that hard. Even McDonald's $1 value salads give you an easy way to do so. I The plus side, the food quality was decent. There were definitely fewer yellow leaves than in my dining hall. But did I really pay $11.80 for this and a 'high class' ambience? This is coming from the guy who used to order salads at El Pollo Loco and get flak for it ("who goes to El Pollo Loco to eat salads"). Walking out of the place my stomach starts growling. Cannot stand. MUST EAT MORE FOOD. College student reverts to his old ways and boils a pot of water. Gets his 59 cent instant noodles from 99 Ranch ready. And thus instant noodles win.

My first visit. I'm not going to say it'll be my last, but I'm hopeful. Ambience: good. Well lit, well ventilated, clean, pleasing decor with subtle colors & simplistic wall decorations. Staff: courteous, attentive, efficient. Food: They offer salads, cold-warm sandwiches and more. ?The thing that impressed me the most is their lil note pad on which you can customize your salad. So I did! I ordered a custom vegetarian salad and my husband ordered a Tuna something salad. While my husband enjoyed his, I have to say I was disappointed with my order - not just because the greens were not as fresh as I expected them to be, but also because I'm not an advocate of cold foods. Chinese medicine speaks of digestion as an art that thrives on warm transformation. Heat is required to break down and transform food into the nutrients that build Qi (energy) and Blood. The noodles and the quinoa I chose, as part of the 6 optional ingredients, were not fresh. The quinoa was clumpy, the noodles were beginning to ferment (it had that peculiar odor). The cucumber was used SO sparingly, cherry tomatoes 3x2=6.......anyway, you get the picture! That being said, I might go back to sample the warm sandwiches. Watch this space for more.

Wait, I haven't reviewed this yet? ?I'm a big fan of Pluto's down the street (which is super healthy and super cheap when you share a salad) but a lot of my friends prefer Sprout... so since I'm flexible I eat Sprout a lot. ?They have a dizzying array of salad options if you want to build it yourself, and it can get quite expensive if you like the good stuff like candied nuts or avocado. ?An easier move in the salad department is to order one of their pre-designed salads - and my fav among them is the Davy: cold smoked salmon, miso dressing, avocado, fennel, and just enough onions to remind you to bring a pack of gum for after. They also have a pretty great selection of drinks including Zico and kombucha teas, if you can stand them.

I was excited to try Sprout after reading all of the good reviews on yelp. ?I was hoping to get a salad, but what I would have wanted would have costed $15 by the time they nickel and dime you. ?I have never heard of anyplace charging extra for dressing on a salad. ?I ordered the Turkey Club sandwich since it came with a side salad. ?When my food came it was an absolute joke. ?My "side salad" consisted of literally ten pieces of lettuce and a side of dressing. ?I wish I would have taken a picture it was so sad looking. ?The sandwich was very underwhelming. ?Boring bread and pre sliced deli Turkey with decent bacon and a chipotle sauce. ?I didn't even finish it and I always finish my Turkey sandwich. ?Always. I ordered the potstickers as well as an appetizer, yet they didn't come out until I was half done with my entree. ?They all came busted open and were unedible. ?I returned them for ?a refund for the first time in my life.

Super fresh salads, whether you choose from a long list of unique Sprout creations or customize your own from a plethora of ingredients. ?Two of us shared a Pomona and a Fruity - both tasty and full of greens. ?Even a few more of the special ingredients would make them better. ?More beets in the Pomona would be perfect. ? I have two suggestions to make Sprout even better. ?One is to add more glitz - maybe interesting quotes or artwork on the wall that leads to the bathroom. ?Second is to get some of those workers who hang around in the front to clean up the bathroom. ?

Sprout Cafe is definitely the place to go if you are looking to eat healthy. Right when you walk in, you see a clipboard with a "create your own" salad menu. If you don't want just a normal salad, you can venture deeper in and you'll find a larger selection of specialty salads, soups, and sandwiches. I ordered the BLTA, which is a normal BLT with avocado. It comes with two triangle halves, each containing 2 bacon strips, avocado, lettuce, and avocado. On the side, is a fresh mixed green salad with balsamic vinaigrette. ? The sandwich is quite flat since there isn't too many ingredients inside. The white bread was a little dry, which cut up the roof of my mouth, so bite with caution. The bacon was dry, but the guacamole helped make it more bearable. I thought the BLTA was really fresh except it definitely could use more ingredients. 4 stars for food quality, 3 stars for price and portions.

I've ordered the BLTA to go twice. The first time it was good, though the bread was too dry the avocado balanced it out. The second time one slice was burnt, the other slice wasn't toasted and they ?forgot the avocado. The salad was ok - too much dressing, but not amazing, just your typical spring mix with a vinaigrette. ?Considering the time I had to wait for my order and the cost, it was very disappointing.

Love the make-your-own salad concept, though I have yet to try it! We came here late last night for some hot and iced tea... They have a good selection, the employees were friendly, and they're not one of those high-horse health food places that don't also offer soda. I've heard it gets busy and loud here during lunch... But I'm willing to take the risk sometime soon! Anyone care to join??

I love the salads here, definitely easy to get addicted to this place. The service can be sooo slow sometimes, even when there are hardly any people in the restaurant. The staff are nice, though. ? There are a lot of options, even for people who aren't big salad eaters. The soup, sandwiches and egg rolls are all very good and not too heavy. Over all a great place for a healthy meal, I'd suggest calling ahead to place your order.

This place is pretty solid and I've been coming here for years now. The butternut squash soup has a great kick with the cayenne pepper. I've also had the chipotle sandwich, the steak sandwich, the shrimp sandwich, the somen salad, the fruity salad, the davy salad, the hunter, and of course customized my own salads and sandwiches. Food comes out pretty quickly and the space is clean.

TLDR-Better places in PA, not worth the wait or the money. Never have successfully received my proper order. I have given sprouts a try multiple times. I have NOT ONCE received my order the way I ordered it. As far as I am concerned Sprouts isn't worth the price, the wait or the frustration. (PLUTOS for the win!) I do have to say their lentil soup is delicious and not something they can easily mess up, unless they mess up the whole batch. Getting takeout orders are MUCH smaller than an eat there order. I experienced this once again today when the rest of my parties salads came out, and mine never came...finally went up turns out they had mine as takeout although they gave me a number signifying that indeed i asked for it for here. But my salad was almost half the size of theirs. I think IF i return to Plutos it will be for Order Ahead soup. Thus allowing me a better chance of getting a proper order and then if it "gets mixed up" its just scooping some soup in a to-go cup.

its almost like counter burger but you customize your own salad..they have many items to select..it's quite nice..i had a full size salad and it came with lots of green in a big o bowl. It was quite big actually and was around 12 bucks or 11 bucks because I added a bunch of fancy items.. the steak is a bit chewy so it wasnt my fav..the crispy tofu was ok and the chicken was nice..prob try the salmon next time..all other items seem to be fresh..i was pretty full off of it..it also came with a slice of bread.. i would come back again..it's quite quiet inside...seems like SOMETHING is missing..tv or something to make it more lively..it's a bit dead..

Sloooow, long lines, unimaginative menu. They are making the salad for you which is nice if you're feeling grossed out by the whole foods salad bar like me (...I really don't wan't the population at large touching my food). The experience is lacking. Wait in a long line (unless you download their iPhone app... Really?), then pay and tip, then wait and wait and wait. What do you tip for waiting in line, serving yourself everything except your salad, eating at a table that got cleared but not wiped off, and waiting a long time. ...20% because you work in Palo Alto and can afford it, I guess. I'm so hungry!!! ...so when I got my salad, it was really good!!

So I finally got around to trying this place. ?Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed. The woman behind the cash register didn't smile, which was too bad. ? I ordered a main salad with tofu something. ?I really should have asked what the 'something' (word I can't remember) was because it ended up being deep fried tofu, which defeated my healthy meal salad idea. ?I chose not to eat the fried tofu because I'm not a fan of fried food, and really, it was my fault for not asking what it was. When the salad arrived, I didn't really see the 6 toppings I had chosen for it. ?After taking several bites, I realized all the good stuff was at the bottom (pumpkin seeds, edamame, etc). ?Was a bummer to have to dig for the good stuff. ?The salad was served with a half a slice of bread - that looked and tasted like it came from a grocery store bought pre-packaged sandwich bread. ? It seems like they are trying to be another Pluto's. ?But they will have to try a little harder if they want to give Pluto's competition in the salad department.

Very fresh ingredients, cute interior with very modern clean space - love the high ceiling and front all glass wall that lets in the light. The menu is a bit hard to read with the just barely big enough type, but I guess I managed. Shrimp sandwich- great aioli sauce, shrimp is a bit sparse and not super flavorful themselves, but still a tasty sandwich in its entirety (fairly certain mine was on a regular soft bun not a green onion bread though) Monsieur croquet - pretty standard, flavorful gruyere though, but visually underwhelming, still it is a tasty classic sandwich. seems alot of ppl complained about service - we came at around 2p though, and it was half empty, took no time at all to get our food, and didn't have a line. The tables next to us were bused right away, though some of the farther tables weren't cleaned as fast. Maybe a tad pricey for what it is, but it is palo alto!

I love fried tofu and their crusted tofu is sooo good! It goes great with butter lettuce and sesame or soy ginger sauce. Should be fine with most ingredients except cheese and fruits. I'd skip the fried onion though, the bits are too tiny. I would order extra tofu (2 total) and have them on the separate plate for easy mixing of the salad dressing.

Wholesome salads with high-quality ingredients that come in large portions if you dine in (as opposed to takeout, where a lot of reviewers' bad experiences seem to be coming from). As large as the salad seems though, without some protein, it's not going to do the trick for me at lunch, so I'm used to adding tri-tip steak on top of the Pomona salad (spinach, quinoa, corn, beets). That having been said, piling the add-ons costs serious money; with a drink, you could be looking at over $15 for lunch. Ouch! Service is rather slow too. Not good enough a cost/quality/portion tradeoff to warrant that kind of money.

I have a love hate relationship with this place. It's pricey. About as pricey as you can get for a quick serve restaurant. So that means the bar should be very high. The salads are great. Very creative, healthy, fresh, organic, and best of all great tasting. So that hits the bar for the high price. However, from there, it's all downhill. It takes FOREVER to get served. They have a mobile ordering service, and the one time I ordered through it, they (Sprout) screwed up almost everything about my order, some of which I caught because I saw the guy screwing it up and some of it I didn't catch until later. I complained, and the manager oh-so-generously gave me $1 off the next order. Wow. I was tempted to tell him that giving $1 off as compensation for screwing up an order is worse than doing nothing at all. Beyond that, they're often out of ingredients and will screw up my in-person order about half the time. But when it all comes together, it's a damn good, healthy meal.

Furikake Crusted Tofu - I will never get tired of this mix of edamame, mixed greens, red bell peppers and just enough flavor vinaigrette. 2. Cobb Salad - bacon and an addictive dressing.

Pros: - Great tasting food Cons (note: during lunchtime): - Crowded, really hard to get a seat - Terrible service (as in, clean your own table...) - Outrageous wait times for a soup/salad/sandwich spot (10 minutes for salads -ok-, 35 minutes for sandwiches/soup -really?-) I'm not sure what is going on in the back kitchen, but I just don't see why it should take over half an hour to make a sandwich, unless they are baking bread to order. They even had to put up a sign indicating the wait times, which deterred more than a few potential patrons from ordering. It was so busy that we had to hunt down a table and then clean it off ourselves. My coworkers mostly ordered salads and left still feeling hungry, but generally enjoyed their food. By the time my food came, almost everyone was done eating (-that- feeling), but they were nice enough to stay and chat while I played catch-up. I ordered the Chipotle sandwich, which was quite tasty, but I still left with a bad taste in my mouth (badoom tsss). I already felt like I had a poor experience; I can't imagine how frustrated some other people must have felt - those who ordered before me and were still waiting after I got my sandwich. Do not come here for lunch unless you enjoy waiting in a big, antsy crowd by the cash register. The food is tasty though, so if you can come outside of peak lunch hours, I'm sure it'll be a much better experience. I will not be coming back for lunch.

I really love Sprout's concept - you can either create your own salad or purchase ид la carte. ?I've only ever use the "create your own" menu, and I really love it! ?There are a ton of choices, so it's really easy to mix it up differently every time you go. ?The only issue I have with the salads is that the full salad (as opposed to the half salad, which I normally order) seems to just be more lettuce with the same amount of toppings as a half salad, so it feels like you're left over with a lot of extra lettuce. The ambiance is really nice - very simplistic, and there's lots of indoor seating with some nice outdoor seating (perfect for people-watching, if you can snag a table!). Every staff member I've encountered has been friendly, so no complaints there. Overall, I have no reason to stop coming here, and I don't plan to anytime soon!

I had the chipotle chicken sandwich and it was ok. It wasn't anything amazing. I wouldn't recommend it. The chipotle sauce tasted more like BBQ sauce, which I didn't really care for. The chicken was flavorful, but not as spicy as I would have liked. And you could barely taste what little tortilla strips there were because they were super thin and soggy. Overall, decent sized sandwich. For, $8.25, I was expecting something close to exceptional at least, but that wasn't the case. I wouldn't mind trying a salad next time though.

Dear Sprout, I truly appreciate your health-conscious food choices. ?This is one place I know I can come with friends who require specialized diets all across the board-- gluten-free friends, vegan friends, "i'm on a diet" friends, and friends who don't want to eat healthy but will grudgingly go because you offer different things. ?I dig that.

Goaded by a coworker's enthusiasm for this place, I took a shot at a Large Cobb Salad sub Balsamic Vinaigrette and sub Chicken Breast for the Bacon. ?In return, I received a large container half filled with salad sprinkled with sparse ingredients and completely devoid of any hard-boiled egg as the salad description promised and was charged $10.72. ?Not only did they omit an ingredient and provide a regular sized portion guised in a large portion container, but they also charged me an additional $2 for the chicken when I requested a substitution.

I really loved Sprout when I first went there. The meat was 10x better than Pluto's and I was able to watch them make my salad. I did have to jump in and correct the guy making it to fix a mistake he made, but I didn't think anything of it at the time. Since, I've ordered Sprout for pickup ~5 times. Each time there's been something wrong with the salad I've ordered. Most commonly, an ingredient is left out, oftentimes with something I really don't like put in instead. Today's salad was what pushed me to write this review. I ordered a salad with OrderAhead which was missing 1 ingredient and barely had any of the others. I was especially disappointed that I asked for extra crispy wontons, ended up with 3 pieces in the salad, and ordered cherry tomatoes and got 1/2 of a cherry tomato. Sprout has continuously gotten worse during the lunch hours, and only if you can really inspect someone making the salad would I recommend it. Try Pluto's down the street instead. Worse meat, but better on the salad consistency.

I almost lost my mind when they were remodeling a while back and I couldn't get my humungous salad fix when I craved it. This place is worth every penny - and yes, in my opinion you pay a steep price here for a salad. But what you get is quality ingredients and amazing flavors.

This is the best salad place. You can customize to build your only salad, There are also plenty choice of pre-build salad menu items. We had 'Davy' salad selection which is a mixed of a lot of arugula, walnut, avocado and other ingredients plus a piece of grilled salmon. It is delicious and big portion. Enough for two people (runs about $12.95). In addition to the salad, we had a big bowl (32 oz) of squash soup. It is rich and creamy. Just right to pair with the salad. Usually we also order a steak sandwich which is the best steak sandwich I ever had. Except today we had a big lunch somewhere. The salad and soup is enough for satisfying dinner.

This place has great and healthy food, but service could be greatly improved. I came in around 6:30 a few weeks ago to order take-out for an ahi tuna salad (4/5) and corn chowder (4/5). The order was ready by 6:40, but the girl who works the cashier (she has a tattoo), didn't even let me know my order was done until it was 6:50. She didn't even call my name out or anything. So...the whole time I was just standing there wondering if that was my food sitting at the counter.

When you walk into this restaurant, you're given a clipboard with a ton of ingredients, and you have to select which ones you want in your salad. It's quite overwhelming, in the sort of way that looking at tax forms often leaves you wondering where to begin! After crumpling up one of my previous configurations, I finally settled on what I wanted, and waited for my salad to come out. While waiting, I took a look around the restaurant. The ambiance is decent enough; the entire restaurant is well-lit, with yellow floors and brown walls and ceiling. Rows of wooden tables line up along the restaurant, with blue and white-cushioned wooden chairs. It's not too very much to look at, but it's nothing to complain about either. Service is friendly enough, taking orders and preparing salads as quickly as possible. As for the food, well, when my salad finally came out, I was a bit underwhelmed. Perhaps I simply chose the wrong configuration. Hard to say for certain. All I know is that I found the fat-free balsamic vinaigrette to be a bit on the bitter side, and by the end of the salad, I found myself having to force it down my throat. If I come in again, I'll probably do one of their salads off the menu and see if what they prepare is better than my custom-made whatever-it-was. Cliff's Notes: Overwhelming selection, underwhelming taste.

Pricing is reasonable (pending you don't add like 10 toppings to your salad), lots of options and above all it's healthy!

Sprout Cafe is one of the best restaurants in downtown Palo Alto. In all honesty, the prices aren't nearly as expensive as some other places. Some of my favorites are the Kyoto, Southwestern, Somen, and the Steakhouse. Everytime I go, I'm very impressed by the staff. The salad guys are always working very hard, the cashiers are friendly, and the server guy is always more than happy to get us any additional utensils. Yes, it's a little noisy in there like some others have complained about, but there's really nothing they can do about that. When a place is a popular as this one, people tend to bring friends to talk to. And guess what? noise happens.... Sandwiches are delish. My favs are the chipotle, portabella, greek, and turkey. But by FAR my favorite item is the shrimp summer rolls. I recommend getting it with sesame ginger dressing instead of the sauce it comes with. You won't regret it!

Sprout is ok. The shitake spring rolls are worth mentioning -- they were great. Most spring rolls have too much of one thing or another, but these were really well balanced. The salads are more interesting than Pluto's. It took forever (at least 5 minutes) to order, even though there were only 3 people ahead of me. And they forgot part of my order. But I would still come back and eat more shitake spring rolls.

Awesome soup/salad/sandwich place with a nice hip/trendy ambience specially during weekday lunch hour. We've tried several of their veg salads, portobello sandwich and butternut squash soup. Would be good for them to upsell and add a coffee bar and desert options to their menu with the fresh salads as their main USP!

I really, really liked this place! I get weary of salad places because most places can't get it reeeeal good consistently. ?I've been a fan of Pluto's but lately they've been coming up really bland. ?I've not craved entree salads since. But low and behold Sprout. ?I met a friend here for lunch, she works close, and I got a little anxiety because of the noise level but the signature salads were great. ?I got the Tuna Nicoise salad and my friend got the Hunter salad. ?The tuna was seared perfectly and soooooo savory. ?The greens were crispy and fresh and the dressing was light but packed with flavor. ?Both our salads were missing potatoes (they had ran out when making ours) so my friend asked and we got 2 pieces fresh. ?Almost like crispy yummy steak fries but healthy. I'd go back here a lot if I lived closer. ?Might just swing by anyway. ?Worth it.

I was in major need of fresh veggies, especially after the holidays. We came here on a monday night and it was fairly busy....always a good sign. They have a "create your own" menu, resembling the Counter Burger place. Or you can order off of the regular menu. I had the Davy Salad, which was DELICIOUS! He ordered the Kyoto Salad, it was good but mine was better :) Service is good. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. I know they do catering and to-go orders as well. I highly recommend it. Quick, healthy and good priced food!

I do like Sprouts. I think some of the items on the menu are a bit too pricey and you don't get enough of the premium ingredients. I mean like a buck for roasted beets and you can't find more than 3 pieces in your salad type thing. I could cite other examples but you get the drift. My biggest issue with Sprouts is that there are ALWAYS ingredients I did not order in my salad. ALWAYS. I hate that.

So this place is by my work and looked healthy so I thought I would give it a shot. I have come here three times and each time I have been less and less impressed. Their salads are just okay. They aren't well tossed when you order them to go and that was slightly disappointing. Also, when they are tossed and you eat it there they have WAY too much salad dressing on them. meh. Also I decided to try their app for ordering. First off, when I ordered by the phone my order was ready in 15 minutes. When trying to order on their app at 11:45 the soonest pickup time was 1pm. I wasn't in any hurry so I decided to wait it out. When I got to my food which I picked up exactly at one, it was soggy and cold. It seems that they may have made my food when I ordered it at 11:45. I understand that they are a busy establishment but I felt that if I wasn't picking up my food until one, my food definitely should not have been made until 12:45. I want to like this place because I like the concept and theoretically what they have on the menu, but I have been let down too many times!

It has good, healthy food. But let me tell you about the lousy experience my family had today. ?(Admittedly it's Valentine's Day...but I'll address that in a moment.) Approximate timeline: 12:05pm: Arrive 12:15pm: Get to the front of the line and order 12:30pm: I get antsy (my two kids are hungry and I have to get back to work), I go up to the cashier and she says it's almost ready 12:40pm: Ditto 12:42pm: Two women see our plight and give my kids bread from their meal 12:50pm: I have to get back to work, and my kids need to go home with my wife and take a nap, so I ask for our food to go 12:55pm: They bag our food to go So my wife and kids went home to eat their lunch, and I went back to work to eat mine at my desk. "Hey," you say "cut them some slack...it was Valentine's Day and it was extra busy." Yes, I agree. But here's what I think they should have done: Tell me that my food wouldn't be ready for 40 minutes, so I could go somewhere else.

I came here raving about their salads and their goat cheese to my friend, but instead turned out to be a completely disappointing experience. They messed up with my order . They forgot the goat cheese.Ok not a problem . Told the waiter who spoke to the lady at the counter. The face she made was worth remembering . As if , it is my fault that I pointed it out. ?Seriously ?? FYI you pay a buck more for it. Ok. Got my goat cheese. My friend's salad had 3 ingredients missing !! And I noticed a lot of salads were being returned back. (Almost all). Oh something worth mentioning, it wasn't crowded for the chef to get all confused. There were just 4 tables to be served about 8 -10 orders in all . Completely disappointed . An apology or "oops I am sorry . Let me fix that " wouldn't have hurt. Maybe I wouldn't be so scathing then . I am not returning back here. I shall try to find another place that serves shaved fennel with a definitely pleasanter staff . ?My quest continues. . .

If you don't pay attention, you may end up paying for something you never receive. Been one of my favorite places since they opened but they've now gone downhill in service. Food is still good and fresh, however, they forgot a few major ingredients in my salad, such as chicken! Didn't even apologize after I brought it to their attention. Only added the ingredients on top and dropped it back on my table as if they did me a favor. With all the restaurants in the area, I'm taking my business elsewhere; where it's appreciated in this economy.

Good food. Respectable prices. Loud interior. I ordered the Kyoto salad which was tasty. In hindsight I should have had them mix the dressing rather than giving me a side. The side was small and the salad was big. The ahi tuna was fresh. The place is busy and they have a lot of hard surfaces which makes for noise especially with the clanging of metal bowls by the staff. Update: I'm downgrading them a star. Went back and had a caesar salad and it very bland. Just iceberg lettuce. No flavor. Nothing special.

Occasion: Lunch pick-up with co-workers What I Had: $7.95 Fruity salad Food Review: Came here with a couple co-workers on their recommendation. This was a huge salad for a very reasonable price! Their Fruity Salad includes mixed greens, seasonal fruits, candied walnuts, goat cheese, sesame ginger and dressing. I'm a huge fan of candied walnuts and goat cheese, so this salad got loads of brownie points from me from the get-go. This salad ended up lasting me two meals. Next time I'll have to try some of their sandwiches and 'small bites'! ? Service Review: Nothing bad about the service. It was pretty much grab-no-go, but the folks at the register were all friendly. Venue Review: I love that this place is relatively close to our office and the line wasn't too long even at peak lunch time hours. Parking can be a little tough on University but we got lucky! They also have a good amount of seating indoors, so it'd be a nice place to eat with friends. Overall Impression: I need to come to this place more often when I start work full time! They have a great selection of salads plus build-your-own, so I don't think it'll be easy to get bored of Sprouts too quickly.

Stanford peeps don't forget you get a 10% discount with ID! I've already been here multiple times now and I'm sad I didn't know (expect to spend ~$15 for a meal if you get and split an appetizer), but their food makes my tummy very happy! Fried calamari--I LOVE that it is not tempura battered; I think they use bread crumbs instead? They come out very crispy and not stuck to each other! Like they were lovingly individually deep fried. It also has a very nice kick to it, subtle at first and builds as you eat more. I'd come back here for this alone! Pulled pork sandwich--Come with a standard boring salad. However, the meat is warm and tender, cooked in their very unique bbq sauce, and served in between toasted ciabatta bread with melted cheese! The sauce was tangy and sweet; it had blueberries and pineapple juice in it! Wish me luck, I'm going to try and replicate this in the kitchen! Tuna nicoise salad--Stay AWAY from this over priced fancy pronunciation mouthful! 4 small slivers of over seasoned seared Ahi tuna (all I tasted was pepper), way too many olives (I thought this was a salad?), and their lemon vinaigrette was too sugary. Don't forget to wash your meal down with their complementary cucumber infused water! So refreshing! Ahhhhhhh!

Love Sprout! It's one of my favorite places in Palo Alto! They have great customizable salads (coming from a girl who hates salads). The sandwiches (especially the pulled pork) and guacamole are great too! Generally will cost you around $10, but the salads are HUGE so you could have leftovers for dinner or lunch the next day. Plus, it's downtown Palo Alto, so $10 for dinner really isn't that bad... Be prepared for a longish line at prime lunch and dinner times. If you order something to go, call ahead to skip a lot of the wait.

This is a quality salad place with fresh ingredients and lotsa options! You can order a half or full salad for a very low price. I picked the Build Your Salad option and it has great unique offerings such as arugula and asian sprouts. For a bit extra you can add all these fancy toppings too such a seared ahi tuna (mmm), roasted butternut squash, avocado, etc. I chose the arugula with a bunch of toppings including avocado, which ?I did not regret. I also loved their sesame ginger dressing - light but tasty and refreshing. A half size is pretty sizeable while the full salad is huge! Also ordered the butternut squash soup which was just ok to me. My hubby ordered the Chipotle Sandwich which was pretty good and filled him.

I have tried this place several times, and I have some helpful hints for those of you wanting to get the most out of this experience. First, get there early (before 11:45am) or late (after 1pm). ?Do not try to get there between 12noon and 1pm or you will be forced to wait in wicked long lines and service is very slow. ?Someone always seems to be on the phone taking phone orders for takeout (lots of people do this) and there's usually only one cashier working the front. Second, order off the regular menu. ?Do not create your own salad. ?Not only will the salad not be perfect (they might mess something up), but the cost is not worth it. ?Absolutely get one of their already-set combos. ?For make-your-own salads, I actually prefer Pluto's. Third, skip drinks. ?Too expensive. ?The salads alone will run you over $10 with tax and tip.

This place offers quite a selection of various salad and sandwich arrangements that will definitely not make it an easy choice for you. It's located conveniently in the downtown Palo Alto area, so if you decide to stroll through the area, it's not hard to find. I ordered the Southwestern salad, which comes with hearts of romaine, aged sharp white cheddar, apple-wood smoked bacon, avocado, sweet corn, red onions, crispy tortilla strips, black beans, chipotle honey dressing, top w/ pico de gallo salsa! Delicious! The one downside I would have to say about this place is the wait. It will take about 20 minutes just to get your order when it could've easily been done in 2. If you're not in a rush to pick up a quick and healthy meal during the morning, I'd say that Sprout Cafe would be great. If not, try to beat the lunch rush and hopefully you'll get lucky!

Most people don't know that I'm a picky eater. ?When I was a child, I was an EXTREME picky eater and well... I was quite skinny. ?I've somewhat grown out of it after multiple trips to NY and a best friend (love you, Ingrid C!) who introduced me to the glories of food, and I haven't turned back. ?I still won't try ANYTHING, but I'll usually try it if it it's recommended or popular on Yelp.

I read a statistic in the news recently (I want to say USA Today, but don't quote me) that said 32% of American adults over the age of 20 are overweight... and an equal number of them are obese. ?That's 64% of American adults!!! ?Are overweight and or obese!! ?America is fat...

The Harvest salad is FANTASTIC. How have I never heard of even a generic harvest salad before I ate here when I love all the ingredients to begin with?? Give me butternut squash, walnuts, cranberries, potatoes, and brussels sprouts, and I CAN DIE A HAPPY WOMAN. Their brussel sprouts are TO DIE FOR. The absolute perfect balance of crunch but still chewy, with that slightly charred burnt flavor but still a little tart from the lime they must've sprinkled over it. The balsamic vinaigrette went fantastically well with everything. And the slice of whole wheat Acme bread on the side definitely does not hurt. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars.. there's just way too much greens! It's not mixed will to begin with so it took me a while of picking at the lettuce and wondering where the good stuff is before I discovered all the goodies buried too deep inside. I would prefer a smaller salad overall with a small proportion of just the greens.

I love the food at Sprout and come here all the time after work for a light meal, but a few things irk me a bit. ? First, they always seem to close up early (around 8:30, when they are supposed to close at 9), and so they shut down the kitchen (hot foods), run out of the delicious cucumber water, and start putting up chairs on the tables to make everyone still ?eating feel unwanted. ? Second, the line is often terribly long, owing mostly due to the very slow cashiers who, while friendly, take what seems like 5 minutes per customer. ?And to make matters worse, people who order online seem able to skip the line, but often still have to pay and still take 5 minutes of time; I once stood in line two away from the cashier for a good ten minutes watching about 6 people cut right in front of me to pick up an order. ?The smart people have learned to order from the cell phones while in line rather than wait in the line. I do agree with Jess C. though, that the food here is better than Pluto's.

We were in search of something light for dinner and I remembered Sprout Cafe as a place that lets you build your own salad. I'd never been before, but knew that it was somewhere on University. A quick look-up and we were on our way. When you first walk in, there's a table with menu ordering slips and little pencils. We spent some time picking out what we wanted and headed over to the register to put in our order. Paying was fast and we got a number to place on our table. I got a salad and added steak to mine. The salad was good and the ingredients tasted fresh. I wish we got to specify how we wanted our meat cooked though, since mine was almost overdone and a bit chewy. Overall, I enjoyed the food and I would definitely come back to try some other menu items.

Food is five stars (for what it is) -- really delicious and fresh salads. I especially like the furikake crusted tofu. Service is like a negative 1000. The cashier people are mesmerizingly incompetent. They are also rude and stare at you with blank, deadened eyes when they have totally messed up your order and/or are making you wait in line for 25 minutes as they sort other people's orders that they messed up. Don't bother using the iphone app. The actual app is fine, it's just that (in my experience) the employees do not check the printouts at all. I've tried 3 times and have had 0% success. One time I ordered calamari online (which they forgot about) so when I got there I had to re-order it. After 15 minutes of waiting someone came up and told me they were out of it. As I left I saw that the people who were in front of me in line had gotten the last calamari, even though I technically placed the order some 30 minutes before them. Management, either ask employees to kindly learn how to use the app or stop providing it!!!!

One of our go to spots after our Thursday jog. The food is good enough, and fresh.I love the asian chicken noodle and chicken spring rolls and fried tofu. They mainly have salads and sandwiches. You can build your own salad if you like as well. This place can get busy and lines can get long. It looks like they only have one person cleaning the tables, a few times I had to help him clean our table.

I enjoyed my shrimp summer rolls. However, here's why I am giving 2 stars: 1) ?Every order for the table of three next to us was wrong. It actually became quite comical as each of their meals come out (all at different times too). First meal didn't have salad dressing, plus had an unwanted egg. Second meal didn't have brocolli that they had asked for. Third meal came with ahi tuna, when the girl had wanted tofu. No bread because they said they were out, even though the meal is supposed to come with bread. 2) When my husband got his salad, it didn't have any steak. Also, no bread. Also, he had asked for cucumbers, but we couldn't find them. When we called the server he said that the cucumbers were there. We looked but couldn't see them. He then said that it's next to the steak. We still couldn't find the cucumber! Then, I noticed the cucumber, it was sliced thinly and there were barely any there We left feeling we had wasted a meal, which is the WORST feeling. So we went to Yogurtland and vowed for the next date night to be at Plutos. Also, Yogurtland is right next to Plutos!

One of the restaurants I missed most from my undergraduate was a classic deli that served gigantic bowls of eclectic salads and sandwiches. Fortunately, a good friend introduced Sprout to me, for their large specialty salads. I have been a vegetarian for some time now and enjoyed my own share of delicious salads, but I have to say that the quality of Sprout's gourmet salads is pretty great. There is definitely a large variety of salads, sandwiches and appetizers that one can chose from. Although, I'd say the star of their establishment are their salads. You are provided with the option of constructing your own, from the array of toppings you can chose from, or choosing a specialty salad. I picked the specialty Kyoto Salad, which I enjoyed a lot. It was an interesting fusion of Japanese and American flavors with dressed soba noodles, perfectly seared crusted ahi tuna, fresh herby greens all tossed with a light acidic dressing. Their salads are a bit on the pricey side, averaging around $9 each, with medium sized portions. I thought that was fine because I don't like leaving a restaurant with an uncomfortable food coma. I definitely left feeling healthy, energized and satiated.

If I lived in Palo Alto, I would go here every day. Since I don't, it's my go-to place whenever I do visit, followed shortly by dessert at Fraiche frozen yogurt a couple blocks away. This review is solely for the salads, since I've yet to try any of their sandwiches, soups, or appetizers. Sprout has an amazing selection of salad ingredients, from typical ones (like eggs, bean sprouts, candied walnuts, and olives), to fancier ones (like quinoa, edamame, somen noodles, and toasted pumpkin seeds), to downright unusual ones (like caramelized shallots, wakame seaweed, and kaiware sprouts). They also sport an impressive collection of dressings, many of which sound absolutely delicious -- the passion fruit citrus, soy ginger, and chili lime vinaigrettes come to mind. The venue itself is rather small; the main seating area consists of ceiling-length glass windows that look out onto University street, but as you make your way towards the back it gets progressively narrower, which can get claustrophobic if you're forced to sit there during peak hours... which for Sprout, seems to be all the time. For those of you who don't like to wait, Sprout allows you to call in ahead of time with your order and they can have it ready by the time you arrive. Pros: - An extensive list of high-quality, fresh salad ingredients, many of which you won't find anywhere else except for a specialty grocery store or Asian market. Cons: - Seems to always be crowded; it doesn't help that there isn't enough seating to accomodate their clientele. - They're only open till 5pm on Sundays. - The wait is long, regardless of when you go or how crowded the place gets. - The price is undeniably steep, but what more can you expect from a cafe in downtown Palo Alto? Favorite custom salad: Hearts of romaine lettuce with oranges, mangos, golden raisins, jicama, and fresh herbs, topped with balsamic vinegar.

I still think the choice of ingredients here is awesome, but in only 2 visits I've experienced 3 major problems, pointing to either carelessness or just stinginess: - Missing ingredients -- my husband's salad was missing one of his requested ingredients... so check to make sure you got what you paid for. - Missing salad dressing on a to-go order... unacceptable. - To-go salads didn't come with any bread (but eat-in ones do) -- what's up with that? GRR. ?So sprout can be a great meal IF you check to make sure they didn't "forget" an ingredient, the dressing, or bread. ?And you have to be OK with loud metal clanging sounds coming from the salad-making employees.

I was looking for a place to get a Chinese salad and came by this place. When you walk in the wonderful aromas greet you. I asked the guy if they offered a Chinese chicken salad and he said no...boy was I disappointed. Then my sister noticed you can customize your own salad. Not sure why he didn't give me that option, but anyway I went with that and made me the best Chinese chicken salad I've had in a long long time. It came with some delicious bread on the side. Every bite was amazing and the portion was really big. Everything nice and crunchy and fresh. The ginger dressing was absolutely amazing. I think for the next time though, I may just get a side salad as I had a hard time finishing it up. If I were to judge this place based on that salad, I would give them the full 5 stars, but I am giving it only a 4 for the lack of customer service. The guy taking the orders wasn't helpful and didn't let me know about the customize salad option. Also, I was not fond of the seating arrangement. Everyone is too close to one another and I for one love my personal space. You can hear all the conversations around you, making it hard to talk openly. The last thing that didn't go well with me was the overly sweet lemonade. I ended up getting up 3 times to fill my glass with water to balance off the sweetness. Next time, I think I'll just ask for a glass of water with a lemon wedge. I also got a chance to taste my sister's Caesar salad and it was amazing as well. This place is pricey though, for my salad and lemonade I paid close to $13, so its not a place I could afford to come on a daily, but I will for sure save my little pennies to try and make it here at least 2 times a month (pay days) hehehe. Overall, I was satisfied and truly amazed at how fresh everything is at this place, we need more places like Sprout Cafe, but can you give us some affordable prices?

No soup and salad/sandwiches combo. No bread that comes with your soup. ~$9 for a large bowl of soup and $0.50 for one piece of bread. I ordered the corn chowder which was pretty tasty, but the above facts lead me to believe that I would have a better meal at a Panera (which I love, by the way).

I love this place! as you walk in, there are forms for your to create your own salad. my friend and i opted to order from the menu. we ordered from two separate registers but was given one number sign. after you order, you sit anywhere you want and they bring out your food for you. once you have your order, they take away the number sign. we arrived at 12. there was a HUGE rush after us so try to go early! my friend had the Kyoto Salad (10.95). The description is taken from the website: "peppered crusted ahi tuna, mixed greens, wakame seaweed, somen noodles, firm tofu, nori, edamame, kaiware sprout, carrots, sesame seeds, miso sesame dressing". The ahi tuna was mouth watering!!!!! i had the steak sandwich (8.75) which had "sliced marinated tri-tip steak, crispy potatoes, sautижed corn, lettuce, mayonnaise, on a toasted acme ciabatta". all sandwiches come w/ salad. i also had an arnold palmer (half ice tea/half lemonade). the steak sandwich was really good also but it was the ahi tuna that blew my mind! it was $20 for two people. we shared everything. Though technically you dont have a server, you should be nice and leave a tip for those who clean up after you. Otherwise, put your own dishes away (like mcds) :]

I take back all the nice things I said about them. ?It seems there's no good time to come here during lunch. ?I've tried all the different combinations. ?Get here right when they open? wait over 30 minutes for your sandwich; get here at 11:30? wait over 30 minutes for your sandwich; call in an order at ?10am? get there at 11:08 (quoted 11:15am pickup), wait 40 minutes! I've seen plenty of people (including myself) that have had to change their minds after they see the wait times. ? So if you are craving a sandwich, good luck. ?Two ladies ordered a iced tea and called it a day today because the wait was so ridiculous. ? The popularity got to their heads and now the service took a nose dive. ?Here's a hint: hire more people before you lose all your customers.

It was late afternoon and we were famished. As soon as I parked, we literally sprinted towards Sprout Cafe. It was the first restaurant in sight. There was a good selection of sandwiches and of course, endless choices on their signature salads. I went with the Pulled Pork (with pineapple BBQ sauce and blueberries) and my mother chose the Steak. The pork was much more flavorful than the steak by far. The steak was also a bit on the dry side. BUTTT what made the sandwiches was definitely the ACME ciabatta bread. Soft inside and crispy on the outside! Service was pretty much self-serve. Water's on the counter. Self-serve. No ice.

Wait = too long Stingy meter = high. No soup and salad/sandwiches combo. No bread that comes with your soup as mentioned by a previous reviewer. Price = too high for what you get. So net net that gets 2 stars. Sure the salad is good, but go to Pluto's. Sure the soup is good but nothing out of this world. 2 stars on Yelp means "Meh. I've experienced better" and that about sums up how I feel for this place.

Portion was decent, I left with a satisfied stomach :) I'm dying to come back!

I waited almost half-an-hour for a relatively simple salad with few customers. Once I got the salad, it was at best, tasteless. The lettuce was on the wilted side, the orange slides had far too much skin, and the grilled chicken was bland in the extreme. The sesame dressing tasted more like a vinaigrette. Not a place I could recommend, nor a place I am likely to return to.

Pricey, but consistently good. I end up paying almost twice as I do as Plutos, but I like the salad twice as often. Their premade selections are great--build your own can be a slippery slope. The menu stands up, across soups and sandwiches, too. Their catering is also delicious. Tip: order ahead of time by phone.

*****************show your student ID card and get 10% off***************** "Look! It's Facebook!" -a crowd of USC tourists invading my town of Palo Alto This small restaurant is located between High and Emerson, not in the center of University, so it's relatively easy to find parking. Sprout has a table set up as you walk in the doorway, complete with a black table cloth and clipboards with salad ordering papers. ?They like you to check off items for your custom salad before going up to the register. The restaurant has a modern look and feel to it, high ceilings and sharp corners. ?Sound bounces off everything so it's very loud inside. ?They have a shared booth seat running along the side of the wall, the opposite side has more tables. After ordering you are given a number and asked to sit down. ?In front of the register are the water pitchers. ?The complimentary water has cucumber slices in it, producing a similar water to the kind you would get at a spa. ?Next to the water pitchers are the forks and knives, which are not brought to your table with your food (you need to grab these and take them with you). 4.95 for a half, 6.95 for a full starts you off with a choice of lettuce/spinach, 6 toppings, and a dressing. ?You can also add meats and premium toppings if you would like to make the price even higher. ?The prices for extras are the same regardless of the size of your salad. I had romaine lettuce, dried cranberries, apples, garlic croutons, and shaved parmesan, with caesar dressing. ?I also asked for strawberries but these weren't on my salad. ?Oh, and I checked off a half salad but paid for and was served a full salad. ?Good thing though, in retrospect. The garlic croutons were a waste. ?They have a few croutony choices, so just get one of the others (tortilla strips, wonton skins). ?The lettuce tasted fresh, as did the apples. ?I was expecting thin wedges, what I got were thin sticks, very tasty. ?Caesar dressing was tasty, didn't taste packaged like another reviewer warned. ?Nothing about the salad was bad. The salad was the best I've had in awhile, the best I've ever had in Palo Alto, and I will be adding this to my list of frequently visited restaurants near my dad's house.

If you like Pluto's, you'll probably like Sprout Cafe. If you hate Pluto's, you should give this place a try. Sprout Cafe, like Pluto's, allows you to build your own salad. But unlike Pluto's, this place is seriously GOURMET. *6 types of greens: arugula, romaine, butter lettuce, baby spinach, mixed greens and red leaf lettuce *30+ standard ingredients of vegetables, fruits, nuts and cheese: too many to name but interesting items like kaiware sprouts, somen noodles, orzo pasta, mango, dried cranberries, crispy wontons, fried onions... *10+ premium ingredients for an extra charge: bacon, caramelized shallots, roasted butternut squash, buffalo mozzarela... *10+ types of salad dressing: chipotle honey, lime tarragon viniagrette, creamy basil, sesame ginger... *Meat and seafood: tri-tip steak, grilled chicken breast, poached salmon, seared ahi-tuna... But if the selection is too overwhelming, especially for the indecisive minds, you can opt for a Signature Salad or a sandwich. I got the Howdy Signature Salad: tri-tip steak, corn, roasted red pepper, avocado on butter lettuce with blue cheese dressing. Yum! Salads are mostly under $10, unless you add tons of extra ingredients. Portions are huuuuuuge. Definitely can split a Signature between two people!

Sprout, where have you been the last couple years?! I've been waiting for a place like this. ?Yes, Pluto's is good. But it's nice to have a healthy alternative other than Pluto's. ?Just think of a Sprout as a "blinged out " Pluto's but for a "knock-off" price. :) The salads here are fresh, tasty and quite unique. The Tofu salad I had was great - the soy vinagrette complimented the greens, edamame and the crusted tofu perfectly. ?The salad was $8-$9 and was accompanied by a really good piece of foccacia bread. ?My friend had the fruity salad and wasn't too impressed, but said he the shrimp sandwich a couple of days ago and really liked it. ?We also sampled the shimp spring rolls and Butternut Squash. Both were forgettable and not worth ordering again. But who comes here for the sides - come here for the salad! In terms of atmosphere, it's open and airy. Almost reminds me of New York on a nice day. The prices aren't too bad - especially for Palo Alto. I will definitely be a regular here and will be brining my hubby here for dinner! Sprout, thank you for giving me another place in Palo Alto to visit regularly!

I came here because a bunch of my lady friends decided to start their own Biggest Loser competition the day of ($50 buy-in, winner takes all - pretty freakin hardcore if you ask me). They still wanted to go out that night in downtown PA though, so they solved their dilemma by picking Sprout Cafe. I came here not expecting too much, and knowing it was a salad place, I scarfed down a ton of meat at home before I drove up to University Ave. The decor of this place was surprisingly nice - well lit, spacious, and had a modern vibe to it. I've never been to Pluto's so I can't make the comparison, but some more information about this place: Both standard selection salads as well as fully-customizeable options for you to choose from. I ordered the Cobb salad, and it tasted pretty good. They do an excellent job with lettuce-to-dressing ratio: not too soggy and not too anorexic with the dressing either. The lettuce was crisp, contents fresh, and the overall ambiance of this place would satiate your average vegan/Prius driving individual. A friend ordered some type of stir-fry tofu with sesame seeds - that was actually REALLY good. Tasted very juicy and meaty. Come here if you want to win your office pool of The Biggest Loser - they serve health for a premium, but is it worth it? Come and decide.

How have I not written a review of Sprouts yet?!?!?!?! Im a total addict. On my most recent trip, my accompanying date said: "Its like an Apple Product. The product is so good, it makes you willing to put up with all of the other surrounding crap." He has a point. What surrounding crap? The lines are long. They run out of ingredients. They lose orders. The ordering system is finicky. The price is steep for a salad. But the product! My. Oh. My. THE PRODUCT. Salads here are simply the best. The ingredients are wildly fresh. The spa water is relaxing. The ambiance is flawlessly fashionable fresh -- you (read as if italicized) feel (alright, back to normal Thom voice) healthy while you are eating healthy. The place even gets packed with attractive clientele who are equally passionate about their healthy food. After a rather extensive internal debate between 4 stars and 5 stars, Im gonna go with my gut: 5 Stars. Set all that crap aside, and realize: it does not get better than Sprouts. Hats off to the Apple Inc of salads.

Surprisingly, there aren't a lot of decent affordable dining options in downtown Palo Alto. There's pizza and some other options, but not much of interest. Pluto's, a fresh salad place, is eh. So I was really happy to stumble upon Sprout Cafe yesterday when I was starved and looking for a bite to eat. They have sandwiches and oodles of salad options, and if you can't find a salad you like on the menu they let you mix and match and make your own. I almost missed this place because they must be new and don't even have a sign above their door. They also have this great brand of hot tea... I can't remember the name... but I really enjoyed my tropical green tea along with my "Fruity" salad. Only reason it's four stars is because the salad wasn't a major wow. It was a good salad, but I wasn't blown away. I'll go back though, I'm sure, because I'll be hungry around there again. The actual dining space is quite large, and it was pretty much empty when I went. I like the design of the space as well.

Move over Pluto's...there's a more chic and "organic" version in town! In a nutshell, Sprout is bright, fresh, somewhat organized, and with the same limited seating as other "make ?your salad" places. What makes Sprout different? ?First off, they have "exotic ingredients." Tuna, Quinoa...yeah...I call that exotic. In addition, you have 2 options. ?You can you create your own masterpiece, or choose from one of the already moron proof salads. Win Win in my book. ?No more idiots standing in line with that puzzled "what do I want in my salad" ?face. I ordered a POMONA salad. baby spinach, organic quinoa, sweet corn, fresh herbs, basil pesto, sugar snap peas, roasted red beets, shaved fennels, cherry tomatoes, feta cheese, red onion. My initial rating was 3 stars, but considering we don't have many healthy options out there...I bumped to 4. I prefer this over Fresh Choice Any Day. ?Long live the Food Revolution and Evelor!

I stopped by Sprout Cafe for a quick and late dinner with a friend from out of town. ?The reviews on Sprout Cafe seemed appealing and it also seemed like a nicer version of the popular Pluto's Cafe (with a dash of the Counter thrown in given their Design-Your-Salad option). The serving style and design is entirely cafeteria-like. ?You write down or choose your order from some standard choices. ?Grab your own glass of water and utensils. ?Then you take a seat and wait for your entrees to be brought to you. ? Selections include a nice variety of salad options (with meat, noodles, etc.) and a much smaller selection of sandwiches. ?Alcohol is served as are some basic side dishes (chicken wings, chicken noodle soup). A few people have complained about the preparation time and wait, but in the late evening, I didn't think it was too bad. ?The salad came out first and was followed by a sandwich order. ? My own order started with the chicken noodle soup ($4.45). ?I thought this was surprisingly good. ?The broth was hot and tasty and had plenty of nice bok choy that had simmered nicely with the garlic infused broth. ?I don't recall too many noodles, but given the expectations I had, this was quite good. I then ordered a chicken pesto sandwich. ?Amazingly disappointing! ?The chicken was all white meat and super dry and flavorless. ?Barely, any pesto was to be found in the sandwich. ?Fried pieces of garlic were used as toppings but really just added to the dry, dry, dry nature of this sandwich. ?If it wasn't for my large glass of strawberry lemonade, I'm not sure how I would have finished this sandwich. ?On a side note, the small salad portion included with the sandwich was fresh and tasty. I've only been here once and perhaps I should have gone with the tri tip sandwich or just stuck with the salads. ?But given my particularly entree, I ?left disappointed, albeit healthier. Sprout Cafe accepts American Express.

Pluto's got some FRESH competition! This place boasts the freshness factor with the same type of food as Pluto's. The twist is their seemingly "healthy" options which Pluto's with their yummy desserts and garlic fries lack may send Pluto's on a health-conscious revamp. However, this is unlikely because we will ALWAYS (besides our better judgment) opt for the garlicy goodness and a cheap cookie/brownie bar just because it's a _day. Come for a healthy affair in a very clean (think Pinkberry) surrounding and enjoy the less than $7 salads!

I came here for lunch with a couple girlfriends recently and ordered a Howdy salad. ?Based on the price (just under $10), I expected the salad to be loaded with ingredients. ?Unfortunately, some of the best ingredients were definitely skimped - like the avocado. ?Also, I was annoyed because I had specifically ordered my salad without onions and, whaddya know, it came loaded with onions. The ingredients do taste fresh but, then again, if I order an expensive salad, I expect it to be pretty mindblowing (plus, I make a mean salad myself!!). ?It wasn't. ?I think the food just doesn't justify the price, but maybe the location does.

Here, let me help you: Are you a salad ho? You know, one of those people who travels to other countries and has a mini panic attack when you realize that it appears it is only in the USA, and only in California specifically, that getting a salad as a meal is a standard practice? Are you a control freak? You like going to the Counter because you like to dictate exactly what goes on your burger? Do you want the freshest most tasty salads and sandwiches with the best ingredients? Wha-bam --- Sprouts is your answer. I used to go to Pluto's down the street but one night I ended up at Sprouts because it was across from the theater...and it was raining...and we were lazy. BEST DECISION EVER! This place is objectively better than Pluto's. Their salads are better, the ingredient options are WAY better, and the sandwiches are more delicious. Best Sandwich: The Chipotle. Just get it. I don't even like "Chipotle" but this sandwich draws me with its spicy siren call on a regular basis. Best Dressing: soy honey mustard vinagrette. Seriously, fucking perfect. With extra apples, some aged white cheddar (+ $1), and chicken breast. This place does not get five stars because they still fail to bring stuff out together. When you're with a group of people, you want to eat at the same time. When I'm eating with my boyfriend, we want to eat at the same time. So just wait to bring my salad until his (my) sandwich is ready, too. Otherwise, awesome!

Lemme get the negative stuff out of the way first. I'm skeptical of this whole organic movement. Non-organic feeds more starving people; and for some of those who aren't starving, they live too long. Some fertilizers and pesticides could be good for world peace. But I have nothing against fresh, healthy food that happens to be somewhat affordable. I went there for a chipole chicken sandwich, it was quite tasty. My friend ordered a custom made salad, which was delightfully simple and delicious too. $18 isn't so bad considering this is at one of the trendiest spot in the Pennisula, and it's right across from the mind-bogglingly expensive Palo Alto Bicycles (a $140 messenger bag?!). If you are really into finer things in life at a reasonable price, this place might be worth checking out.

If you are sometimes indecisive like me, where too many choices and large menus can be daunting and dizzying, I highly suggest studying the menu BEFORE coming. You order and pay first before they bring your food out to you. There's a lunch crowd but operations are smoothly run. It can be pricey, especially if you start adding premium ingredients and protein but portions are huge and filling. Plus, the ingredients are super fresh. Kyoto salad was excellent. The dressing (miso sesame) was pretty light but went well with the somen noodles and tofu. Refreshing. I liked the addition of crispy tortilla strips in the chipotle chicken. I've never had that in a sammy before and it provided that extra crunch! I was a lot more lukewarm about the curry red lentils soup. I expected it to be spicier but it was chunky, if not a tad salty.

One of the things I really miss about working in Palo Alto. ?While places with great salads are ubiquitous in LA, they're so hard to find in the Bay Area. ?Enter Sprout. ?All kinds of fantastic salad combinations, along with freshly made soups (all featuring organic and locally-sourced ingredients, natch). ?Some fun appetizers if you don't want to go too far down the health-food alley (homemade guac and chips, gyoza). ? The place gets completely packed at lunch, so show up early if you don't want to wait for a table. ?When ordering take-out it really helps to call ahead - otherwise prepare for a long wait.

After around 50 visits to Pluto's over the years, I was excited to see another restaurant focusing entirely on salads. ?And while Sprout Cafe doesn't offer salads at the very low prices available at Pluto's (~$5 as opposed to Sprout's ~$10) they have a much wider array of options, fresher ingredients, and more interesting signature salads. Sprout has a very open feel and not nearly as many customers as Pluto's, so it's a more pleasant dining experience with less time standing in line. ?Their salad ingredients are about 3 times more diverse than at Pluto's and the colors are more vibrant and the common ingredients are tastier. ?They offer about 10 signature salads ranging in price from $7.5 to $12, which have generally been really good, and stood out as being very very attractively composed. Tofu - Centered around a large chunk of tofu in a fried skin, this was a great salad, with the tofu crust being the best part. ?It was on a bed of mixed greens and had edamame and sprouts, which stood out as a little too isolated and crunchy for the salad to totally come together. Kerr Salad ($9) (or another female name) - This one was my favorites (though admittedly I forget the details). ?It had a little fruit and a slightly sweet dressing that was very light and tied the whole salad together really nicely. Caprese ($9) - Great caprese with succulent tomatoes (though not the best I've had in caprese), quality mozzarella, one of the best balsamic vinaigrettes I've ever had, and a knockout bread that make's Pluto's bread seem stale. ?All on a large bed of very fresh leafy greens. Caesar ($7.5) - Didn't enjoy this salad as much. ?The bright crunchy lettuce was similar to most restaurants' Caesar greens and the dressing also felt too familiar. ?It had four large anchovies, which turned me off, though might make this salad a standout for people who enjoy them. ?Large and somewhat hard croutons were different than most places' croutons, but not nearly as tasty as the very soft bread that came with the salad. Howdy ($9) - One great thing about Sprout Cafe is their judicious use of high quality salad dressing. ?I was hesitant that a salad with blue cheese dressing and dressing wouldn't just taste too heavy, but they manage to make this salad with steak, blue cheese dressing, and some shredded cheese feel light. ?I really enjoyed this one more than I expected I would. They have a good selection of sandwiches and small dishes for people who want to bring friends who won't accept salads as a meal and also serve wine, beer, and an assortment of drinks for the Whole Foods set.

Anyone who knows me well should know that I love seared Ahi Tuna. I also love places where I can customize my own food (The Counter, Plutos). Sprout allows me to have both. At the same time. Which equals 5 stars. I loved Plutos while I was in college, and I would say that Sprout is a bit of a grown up plutos. Fresher ingredients, ahi tuna instead of the usual chicken/steak, servers actually bring out your food and give you utensils, and Sprout has calamari.

CTO Salad! Ok I work in tech, CTO = configure to order. But seriously I like a place with choices and a nice atmosphere. And yes I also like Plutos, but I really liked the salad I made here. Trying to pick something light with a group of friends we decided on this place being as we wanted something slightly more upscale. Upon entryway there are menus on little clipboards and those tiny pencils. We grabbed a set, and a table and started picking out our salads. I ordered romaine lettuce with mangos, pine nuts, pepper seared ahi, ?and fresh mozzarella mixed in with passionfruit dressing. It was the perfect mix of tart and savory flavors. I thought it was so good that the next day I wanted to go back and make something else. I also love their choices of fresh fruit. It's not precut and in some bin, but whole and sitting in a basket where you can see it.

A friend found Sprout Cafe on Yelp and we decided to eat here for lunch today. ?In my mind I thought to myself "great, what is a carnivore like me going to find in a place named after the one green that I hate most of all??!" Walking in I was still hesitant but the place looked great. ?It has a very fresh metro coffee shop look to it and although it isn't completely open to the outside, it certainly has that open air feel to it. ?Once I checked out the menu I was relieved to find plenty of dead creatures for me to eat! I had the steak sandwich and home made lemonade. ?The sandwich was very unique with crispy potato skins and sweet corn and a dressing that was impossible to resist. ?There were other options on the menu including custom built salads, pot stickers, spring rolls etc. ?Although the prices were a bit more than your typical sandwich, it was still more than reasonable for the quality of the food. I would eat here again in a heart beat and recommend it to anyone hanging out on University Ave.

Great salads at a good price (cheaper than Whole Foods). ?Sanwhiches, soups, appetizers as well. It can get CHAOTIC in the evening, due to their popularity. ?The line was about 10 deep when we arrived but moved quickly. ?But then there was nowhere to sit. ?So after waiting a few minutes, I found us a table for 2. ?Totally packed making it hard to even get up and grab silverware or water. We had a custom salad - my wife had good tastes. ?Great quality of produce - just what we wanted. ?They offer a huge list of items you can add, which is nice since perishables seem to wilt/rot more often than reach our plate, at home. We also had a soup - butternut squash, which was underseasoned and needed pepper. ?But I'd take under rather than over any day of the week. We also had a gluten free sandwhich - portabella. ?It was ok, but obviously the GF bread was lacking (just the stuff you get at the store). ?But you can't hold this against them - they actually have GF bread, which is awesome! So try to avoid the lunch and dinner rush, otherwise - solid!

I pictured an upgrade from Plutos and that is not what I got. I had high hopes for this place and really wanted to like it. Love salads, especially places where you can mix, match, and toss in whatever you desire. The ingredients list exert a much higher quality and variety than Plutos, but portion size is lacking. I was so overwhelmed by the ingredient choices for my salad that I just opted for one of their signature salads (Come on, the pictures on their web site look amazing, it HAS to be amazing right?!)... - Tuna Nicoise ($9.95): Served with a slice of bread. Ahi tuna (spicy, like it had wasabi on the pepper crusted edges!) , butter lettuce, green beans (a few strings), roasted potatoes (don't recall getting any), kalamata olives (OMG, so salty!), egg (small hard boiled cut in half), cherry tomatoes, fresh herbs (don't remember seeing any), lemon tarragon vinaigrette (not enough and I could barely taste it). OVERALL: Bland, not even close to being loaded with ingredients just consisted of a LOT of lettuce, it was a disappointment. - Steak Sandwich ($8.75): Tri-tip steak (Barely any), crispy potatoes, sautижed corn, lettuce, mayonnaise, on a toasted ciabatta. OVERALL: The corn was a good addition and flavor was good, but the portion size of steak was definitely lacking. Bread was hard as a rock. As much as I wanted to eat it, I was scared for my teeth. - Strawberry Lemonade ($2.50): Normal lemonade with a bit of strawberry bits and pieces squirted in from a bottle. The cup that it came in was quite small for the price paid. Placed our order, sandwich was brought out by the waitress rather quickly. Waited, waited, and waited for my salad. Other people that placed their order after me, received their salads. They ordered the same salad as mine too. Asked the waitress and my salad wasn't even made yet, no apology.

How do you spell "overrated?" In Palo Alto, it's spelled "Sprout Cafe." Compared to Plutos (same concept, so fair comparison) the prices are upgraded. Unfortunately. the quality of the food is not. You can design your own salad or select one from the menu. I ordered the "Howdy" salad which came complete with raw tri-tip on the top. I mean, I think the meat was cooked for maybe 47 seconds before they put it on my salad. To their credit, they threw it back on the grill without complaint but this was not the only way this salad was lacking. The dressing was bland and the rest of the salad kinda boring. Bleh. Went with three other folks. Two were completely satisfied with their food. The third ordered a salad with fennel. Fennel's a subtle thing - you can't load something down with fennel otherwise the dish will taste like super strong licorice. I'm thinking there was a firesale on fennel the day we went because her salad was completely covered with it. Fennel extravaganza! Not okay. I know that University Ave is the most expensive strip in an already expensive city. I expect to pay a higher price than other locations. I also expect higher quality, or at least the same standards as elsewhere. ?Basics, people, basics. Just because you pay more here, don't be fooled people! This place is truly overrated.

Sprout takes the humble salad to a level not seen in this area. A nice selection of signature salads, including standards such as the Cobb, Caesar as well as Sprout original combinations, custom salads and also sandwiches and potstickers. The obvious comparable is venerable Pluto's, just a few blocks down the street. Flavor-wise, Sprout is much, much better than Pluto's. Sprout's ingredients are fresh and flavorful. I like that the room is open and spacious, but the layout is a little odd. you have to go to the far end of the counter to order. they prefer you fill out the piece of paper on a clipboard even when ordering a "signature" salad instead of a custom salad. there is also no intuitive place for a line to form. the refrigerator with drinks and pre-made salads faces the side wall so it's hard to see what they have when you are standing at the register.

So disappointing! After hearing people rave about this place, saying it was better than Pluto's, all I can say is MAJOR letdown. First, the girl at the register let us stand in front of her for 10 minutes before taking our order. Hello! Ask the phone caller to be put on hold for a sec! Then she finally got off the phone and started attending to other random things before taking our order! Finally, she rung us up, and omg, I knew this place was a little pricey, but damn! $24 for 2 salads? How do Stanford students eat here on a college budget? Oh, right, they're Stanford students... The Kyoto salad sounded like it had so much potential. It even looked pretty! But everything was just blah. The flavors just didn't go well together, and the noodles made my salad feel soggy. My boyfriend's custom salad was decent, but still not worth the $. I'd rather order that same salad from Pluto's...

When I worked at Nola, I used to dine here, quite often really. Their salads are fresh, ingredients are local and there are over 20 different types of salad toppings you can choose from. This is like Pluto's on crack. The only gripe I have is that EVERY TIME I do a take-out, there is at least one missing item (missing salad dressing, missing bread etc..) The first couple of times it happened, I didn't mind because it was that amazing but as I continued to do take-out and shell out at least $9 on a salad, it became really annoying. So, if you are going to do take-out, please make sure you check your bag, because I guarantee something is missing.

Vin, the owner of Sprout, is awesome. He has been doing the catering at the investment company I work for (with about 40 employees), for almost a year now, and we ADORE HIM. He is just a joy to work with and obviously goes through a lot of effort to provide us with great service. The food is really good and ?the employees here love it. If you want to see the spread here is a pic (this is just what goe on the table, the hot food (sandwiches, etc) I didn't even get a picture of. http://www.yelp.com/biz_бн There was a time where we were getting Sprout as our caterer for about 4 times in a row and no one complained. The food is always fresh and very healthy. One day I'm going to take a photo of the spread he sets up for us when he does our catering (at least a few times a month). The portabello veggie mushroom burgers are my favorite. They also make an awesome creamy basil dressing. Every time he shows up to set up our lunch, he is so friendly and sweet to us, and if there ever was a single thing wrong with our order (like if we needed more dressing or something), he fixed it immediately (it was rare though, he's a perfectionist and tends to get it exactly right). When he shows up with our order and we start chatting about our weekends, we always find out he was working both days. I think he gets his workaholism from his parents, who owned a Chinese Restaurant (that he helped to run before opening Sprout). ?How the guy has the energy to be so friendly after working a 6 (or probably 7) day week is beyond me, but my hat is off to him. Thank you so much for everything Vin, WE LOVE YOU!!

When I need to recuperate from carb overload, I come here. The salads are great, both custom and menu item listings. Their ahi tuna option is fab--a bit spicy too. The kaiware sprouts are refreshing. I'm also a fan of their creamy basil dressing. The Sailor (salmon, corn, onions, mangos, etc) is a win, as is their Tuna Nicoise (with ahi tuna!). The soup I tried, the butternut squash, was disappointing, and wait for the food could get pretty long, too.

The croque monsieur, the grilled cheese and the capri have all been solid sandwiches as well. The best thing about Sprouts though, is the lentil soup. ?It is so deliciously flavorful and filling without being overly salty. ?I want to try some of the other soups but I don't know that I can come here without getting the lentil one. ?

Wow, this place makes Pluto's seem ghetto. The salads here are awesome. Ok, I've only been here once, but I can tell it's a winner. First off, they have such a great selection of lettuces!!! I love butter lettuce and no salad bar type place ever has that. They also have arugula as well (extra charge). Talk about swank. Then you get to customize your salad however you want with all sorts of toppings. They also have a lot of great dressing selections and the ability to customize how much you want or if you want it served on the side. Awesome! Only a few gripes: 1. It's pricey for the good stuff! 2. You don't get much meat for the extra cost. 3. They often forget or add things that you didn't order. But all in all, I want to come here a lot!

Since I'm going through this phase of no meat, this restaurant caught my attention. I'm always down for a good salad. And this place definitely hit the spot for the leafy veggies. Walking in at 11am, there wasn't any line but the restaurant looked inviting. With tiny clipboards for customized salads or their huge menu of salads and various sandwiches, I was sold. I ordered the Farmhouse salad with dressing on the side. Despite my order coming out with the dressing tossed in, they were more than willing to redo my salad. I don't like a lot of dressing and sometimes I like dipping my salad into the dressing. It's definitely not a restaurant where a waiter comes by to take your order but you go to the counter and pay. They are very quick in bringing out your food and everything seems to be fresh and organic. The BF said their tri-tip sandwich was really good and the bread they use is amazing. ?Thick and hearty bread. Crunchy and delicious. Now I'm craving to go back to try more of their salads.

Seriously I haven't reviewed Sprout yet?? If you like salads (which I don't), Sprout is fantastic. Tons of fresh, yummy ingredients that can be combined in more ways than imaginable. If you're feeling creative or picky, build your own salad from scratch (kind of like The Counter). If you're feeling adventurous or lazy, try one of the pre-assembled salads on their menu. They've also got a solid selection of fresh sandwiches, chips, wines, and other beverages. My favorite is the Croque Monsieur with mixed greens and balsamic on the side (also coincidentally my favorite salad). Oh, and the iced tea is bottomless - definitely a perk. My only serious complaint is about the service - the tables are always dirty, it usually takes forever to get my food, and the service is so poorly timed that I've twice had my sandwich come AFTER my mom was done with her salad. But hey, if you're a salad girl (or guy), the menu is pretty much perfect.

Yum. That's all I can really say. Being a vegetarian who adores massive salads, this is a joyful new addition to my life. My mother and I went there last night after seeing "Happy-Go-Luck" at the Aquarius. We both had salads [I built my own: main/large spinach and lots of veggies, with balsamic vinagerette], and shared an order of the veggie eggrolls. I was absolutely full after I finished, but a good, happy full. The salad ingredients were very fresh and crisp. The eggrolls weren't greasy [major plus in my book], and the place was well lit and appeared to be very clean. Plus, the staff were very friendly and efficient. I was so impressed that I went back today and ordered a salad to go. Again, I was impressed. I must say, for $7, a main/large salad could feed two peopleand fill them up. It would last me a few days. If I wanted, I could live on their salads and nothing else everyday. Greatest $7 spent. GO! Enjoy!

2 stars, 1 star deduction to balance out the insanely high reviews. I gave this place 3 chances, and they failed me every time. ?There are a few major issues, some of which are fundamental to the restaurant business: 1. Charged for something they didn't give me -- all 3 occasions. 2. Food did not match description -- 2/3 occasions. 3. Overpriced Every time I went, either I or someone in my party ordered and paid for a premium topping (tofu, steak, etc...) and did not receive it . Unfortunately, we didn't notice until after we left. ?Considering your only job is to take check boxes on an order form and put the corresponding ingredients into a bowl, this is a major fail.

Thank you esther s. for bringing me here for the best sandwich I've had in a very long time ;) I had the Tri-Tip steak sandwich. WOW!! Didn't even know I would enjoy a steak sandwich, since I don't eat beef often. The ingredients were SO FRESH! The name really fits :) -The bread was amazing, does anyone know where they get it?! I can imagine a million things I wanna dip it in! -The steak was seasoned and cooked well, but a little too thick! Kinda hard to chew, and it was a HUGE mess for me to eat when the meat kept falling out. -The corn & veggies inside really pulled the sandwich together.

Need a quick, healthy fix? Come to Sprouts! BUILD YOUR OWN SALAD. ---FOOD PROTOCOL--- Come in, pick up a note pad with all the ingredients and select: 1. What type of greens (romaine, mixed greens, etc.) 2. Pick 6 toppings (carrots, edamame, feta cheese, almonds, etc. -- huge huge selection!) 3. Pick optional "specialty items" -- meats, roasted veggies, etc. 4. Select salad dressing (so many!) 5. Select size 6. 10 minutes later...super fresh delicious healthyness! Here's what I got: - Half size - Mixed Greens - Sweet corn, mangos, edamame, carrots, red bell peppers, sliced almonds - Sesame Ginger Dressing = spicey - Pepper-Crusted Seared Ahi Tuna = oh! that's spicey! Granted that they forgot to add my mango slices, everything was super fresh! ---VALUE-- $10ish for a filling salad. (If you don't get the specialy meat, it would it's about $6ish). ---AMBIANCE--- Very neat, modern, earthy toned place. Love the color combination. Very clean. I'm going to have to Yelp for a place like this in the East Bay...I don't think one exists, does it?!

This place is like a fancier Pluto's. The food is decent, but the service is just horribly slow. We waited a good 10 minutes in line even though there was only a few people in front of us. They need a better system for people who call in their orders and pick them up later. Even after you order, you have to wait awhile for your food to come out. I had a croque monsieur and it was a bit on the salty side. I would come back, but only during off-peak hours.

Mmm, I love Sprout Cafe! ?I was a bit hesitant at first after seeing some so-so reviews, but I was really glad I gave it a try. The place is kind of a mix of The Counter and Pluto's. ?You have the option of making your own salad by marking ingredients off a checklist (like The Counter), or you could go with their set menu of already concocted delicious salads and sandwiches that they make fresh per your order (like Pluto's). I took the advice that most people stated which was to go off of Sprout's own menu for salads, as they do end up costing less and might taste better than whatever random mish-mash you'd throw together yourself. ? We got the Kyoto Salad (peppered crusted ahi tuna, mixed greens, wakame seaweed, somen noodles, firm tofu, nori, edamame, kaiware sprout, carrots, sesame seeds, miso sesame dressing for $10.45) and the Tuna Nicoise (pepper crusted seared ahi tuna, butter lettuce, green beans, roasted potatoes, kalamata olives, egg, cherry tomatoes, fresh herbs, lemon tarragon vinaigrette for $9.95). ?I asked for the creamy basil dressing instead of lemon tarragon because I love basil, and it turned out to still be a winning combo. The salads are HUGE. ?This is honestly probably not the healthiest salad you can get but it is REALLY tasty. ?The Kyoto had a nice mixture of savory from the seared pepper tuna and sweet from the seaweed salad. ?I really liked the butter lettuce of the Nicoise (such a nice change from gross iceberg), the crunchiness of the green beans, the saltiness of the olives and the great roasted potatoes. ?I wish most breakfast places served roasted potatoes like this. ?It was perfectly seasoned and the skin was nice and crunchy whereas the inside was firm. ?Yum! ?We devoured both without hesitation. ?Oh, and both salads came with a piece of bread. ? I came back a second time around with friend who made her own salad and it looked pretty good as well. ?She ended up getting a half size, which seems to be the right amount if you're a female or child (or male on a diet) and not starving. ?I got the Kyoto and ended up taking a lot home. There are several other salads I'd like to try but I've also eyeballed people's sandwiches... Parking and seating can be a pain during the lunch rush, but the wait to get your food isn't too long.

I once caught one of my coworkers eating the potting soil from a plant in our office. ?I watched her stuff her face for a few seconds before it sunk in that what I was seeing was actually happening. ?When she noticed me looking, she told me with a rather embarrassed look on her face that her pregnancy was causing her to crave things uncontrollably - possibly because her body needed these minerals, and that apparently, soil was one of those things. ?I guess this isn't too uncommon, but it still weirded me out. ?Seeing a toddler stuff dirt in his mouth and a grown woman stuff dirt in her mouth are quite different. ? Yesterday, my husband looked at me with an equally shocked look on his face as he watched me devour a salad from Sprout Cafe. ?I am an avid vegetable hater, and rarely if ever voluntarily eat veggies. ?For some odd reason, yesterday I had an uncontrolled urge to eat a big salad, and this led us to Sprout Cafe. ?I had the best salad I have ever had and after Pete saw the sheer pleasure eating a salad gave me, we went back again today. I love Sprout Cafe. ?Love it. ?They offer quite a few sandwich and salad choices as well as letting you BYOS (build your own salad). ?The first salad I had was so good that I had the same thing again today. ?There are handy little clipboards with menus to check off what you want on your salad and it makes the process really simple. ?You choose the size (full or half), the greens (baby spinach, baby arugula, butter lettuce, hearts of romaine, mixed greens or red leaf lettuce), pick any optional toppings (furikake crusted tofu, shiitake mushrooms, grilled chicken breast, tri-tip, pepper crusted seared ahi, and poached salmon), standard ingredients (lots of veggies, fruits, seeds, nuts, crunches, and cheeses), premium ingredients (like apple-wood smoked bacon, avocado, egg white omelet, roasted butternut squash, etc.), premium cheeses, and of course your choice of dressings (15 choices!). ? I had the butter lettuce, furikake crusted tofu, various veggies, grapes, golden raisins, toasted almonds, and goat cheese with a yummy chipotle honey dressing. ?SO GOOD. ?The full salads ($6.95) are HUGE and come with a piece of amazingly fresh bread. ?The tofu was DELICIOUS. ?Yes, delicious. ?The crust on it was so good and it worked really well in the salad. ?I had the dressing mixed in and it wasn't overdressed at all. ?It took a long time to eat such a huge salad (even with help) and it never got soggy and there wasn't a pool of dressing at the bottom when I was done. ?There are so many toppings and dressings to choose from that I have a feeling I will come back many, many times and never get bored. Pete ordered a sandwich (the BLTA) which came with a side salad. ?He's pretty picky about BLTs (because I make such good ones) but he still raved about this one. ?The side salad was simple (arugula and balsamic dressing) but good. ?There were several other sandwich choices that looked great, so Pete will be happy at future visits. ? I am so glad my cravings were of the veggie variety, and not of the soil variety. ?It still shocked Petey, but not quite as much as if he caught me bent over a potted plant :) ?I'll save that for when I am pregnant.

I like to think of this place as a salad joint that a man can go to without losing any masculinity. Yay! The salads are great, but the real fun comes when you make a custom salad. Also with custom salads come higher prices depending on what you put in there. I made a $15 salad with grilled chicken, spinach, damn, I don't remember all that went into it, but it was tasty. Elaine made one that was a bit more and it totally blew mine out of the veggie-washing water. The pot stickers are pretty good, and the corn chowder's taste isn't always consistent day-to-day. Go here. Get the honey-chipotle dressing. Thank me later.

We were looking for a casual spot to eat at and this hit the spot. The first thing to catch your attention is the entrance table of clipboards asking how you want your salad. They have a good selection of ingredients even how you want your dressing served. I ordered my "custom build salad" but they also have a selection of pre-designed salads too. I'm not too sure about their selection of cooked foods. I assume most of their income comes by way of salad orders. I was quite happy with the quality of food. It tastes fresh. I need to add that I put apple-smoked bacon in my salad; hence, it was destined to taste great. Unfortunately there was a ghost-faced ill lady at the time that I was eating. The paramedics came in and took her away. I hope she's alright. Even the cooks came out with a concerned look on their faces.

I want to like this place. I really do. BUT. There are two things you need to know about Sprout Cafe: 1. they're a direct rip on Mixt Greens in San Francisco 2. they screw your order up. Mixt Greens has an assembly line going on that works pretty well, but Sprout Cafe made the choice to have people check off what they want on an order sheet. This means that sometimes you ask, and pay for, stuff you don't get. Light dressing can mean no dressing. "Butter lettuce" has meant arugula. And so on. The moral of the story: CHECK YOUR BOX or BOWL. Like I said: I want to like this place. I really do. BUT.

This place puts a place like Pluto's to shame. If you come here, I don't recommend building your own. ?Their combos are deliciously crafted, and have well balanced flavor. ?If you build your own, you will pick the things you always lean to - boring! And if you get TOO adverterous in the pick your own - gross! ?Trust the Sprout. ?Order their menu items.

Sprouts is a great place to go if you're looking for a salad or sandwich for lunch or dinner. Not only are the prices very affordable, but the food is delicious. I've been to Sprouts a few times and my favorite to date is the tri-tip steak sandwich. The meat is tender, packed with corn, a light mayo spread and of all things potato chips. The service here is very efficient, you may just have to wait a few more minutes for your food if the place is packed.

This place is pretty awesome. They keep adding to their list of salads and sandwiches (soups, too), but you can make your own from a huge array of choices. Kinda like the counter, but for salads. Lines are long and seating is sometimes scarce. Be prepared to wait. They are also pretty light on the dressing so I always add extra.

My friend introduced me to Sprout(s) (I think Sprout Cafe is a mouthful. ?We call it Sprouts) a couple of weeks ago and we're now averaging 3/5 days of the work week there. ?The prices are a litlte high (10 bucks for lunch in my book is a bit steep) for my liking but I think it's well worth it. ?Produce isn't cheap! The first time I went, I had a tri tip steak sandwich: super yummy. ?The bread was toasted and had crispy chips inside of it, the meat was tender and splendid. ?I was so full I only managed to eat half of the sandwich. ?I took the rest back to the office. ?I tried nibbling on it an hour later but it just didn't have the same crunch. ?Yes it was downright soggy. ? I went protein crazy with my salad and had the furikake tofu and the seared pepper ahi tuna along with a full salad. ?Not a good idea; I was so full that my friend rolled my green butt out of the restaurant. ?Its quite a lot of greens; next time I'm going to get a half salad with the two proteins. ?The ahi was good but they only gave a few pieces for the extra few bucks which was disappointing. I usually go at around 2 PM and its less crowded. ?My friend and I pull two tables together so we can sit on the comfy booth side together. ?The salads are pretty quick and the sandwiches do take a little while longer (a few minutes vs about 8 minutes). And finally, I drink about a gallon of cucumber water everytime I go. ?YUM.

It's about time I reviewed Sprout. ?I've been here at least 4 times now, which is nearly the most of any restaurant in Silicon Valley. Enjoy: Amazing selection. ?At least 5 different types of greens, pick 6 of probably over 50 add ins for free, then extra premium ingredients and meat, tofu, fish, or mushrooms. ?Great quality ingredients, too. Ability to get many different dressings in different states (on the side, light, extra) Sandwiches are pretty good as well. Half a slice of tasty bread with the order. Large salad is huge. ?Half salad is about a normal entree salad size. Fantastic lemonade. Not so much enjoyment: A bit pricey for salad. Not much meat if you order it-- the extras (meat, tuna, tofu, mushrooms) seem a bit too over seasoned for my tastes. As my boyfriend mentioned the other day, you can't see the prebuilt salad/sandwich menu when you walk in. Cheapest glass of wine is like $7....not that I really want wine with my lunch, but that's bordering on pricey. ?I guess it is Palo Alto after all. A great place to get a light, healthy meal with tons of veggies. ?Especially great in the summer. ? Check it out if you're willing to drop money on a salad.

I ordered the tri-tip sandwich which was my first mistake. ?Sandwich at at salad joint. ?(I won't make that mistake again) ?The sandwich had enough tri-tip where I could have eaten it in one mouthful. ?The corn in the sandwich was a nice addition but not enough to save it. Secondly, ?My girlfriend ordered a simple tuna salad and waited as orders of the same salad were ordered after us came out to other tables. ?After informing them that they forgot our order, there was no apology or even the slightest gesture. ? Lastly, the strawberry for the "strawberry lemonade" came out of a "squeeze bottle" and set us back $2.50 for a small glass.

LOOOOVE this place. I try to be healthy sometimes but am also an avid meat/fatty foods eater. This place provides a scrumptious, healthy alternative but doesn't scrimp on flavor. They have a tremendous selection of very fresh and seasonal ingredients. I've had the FRUITY and the TOFU and both were amazing. I've never heard of anyone NOT liking this place. Veggies and Carnivores alike. A little pricey for just salad, but hey, no one ever said eating healthy was ever cheeeap. At least it tastes good going down!

Salad. ?Conjures up all kind of boring, right? ?Well guess what, salad is great here. ?I went with the family for lunch in Palo Alto. ?Rather than doing the oh-so-tempting cheeseburger at Peninsula Creamery (http://www.yelp.com/biz/бн), we decided to go light and get some healthy salads. Consider the difference between an old-school side salad and a typical CPK monster salad. ?One is boring and way too little. ?The other is tasty but may run into several million calories. Sprout gets it right. ?I had the Rocky salad w/o Gorgonzola. ?Baby spinach & baby arugula (no actual babies, OK?), tomatoes, grilled chicken, slivered nuts, and ranch. ?They really toss the salads well - you get a little bit of dressing on every piece, but the food is not drowning in it. ?The ingredients were fresh and very tasty. ?I devoured it, leaving little trace other than a few stray leaves that escaped my fork. My son had a BLT, which was new for him. ?I took a nibble of the bacon on it, and I now need an excuse to order anything with bacon on it from here during the next week. ?I mean it was fantastic bacon. ?Yum. I found the restaurant to be open and airy, with lots of sunshine pouring in over the crowds of people. ?I hear that on the weekdays that you have to wait in line for a while before getting served, so consider calling ahead. ?Yeah, I am a real fan. ?Now I gotta figure out a way to work on University Avenue so I can pop in here for lunch all the time!

Hip, cool healthy joint in Palo Alto. ?I ordered the tri tip salad, which I thought was just ok. ?The meat was kind of dry and I've had better dressing. ?My friend ordered the tofu salad, which actually looked a lot tastier and much more colorful. ?I may try that some time. The salads were somewhere from $7-$8, which seems to be pretty standard for fancy salad places. ?Just make sure you're getting value for each dollar! ?I thought I was by going with a tri tip, but the meat didn't excite my flavor buds. The service is quick. ?You put in your order at the counter and seat yourself, then someone brings you your order. ?Pretty simple. Be weary of the crowds, as it may be difficult to find seating during the rush hour. ?We came here for dinner on a Friday night around 7 pm and were lucky to snag a table, with one of us manning it while the other putting in our orders. I like to say this place is similar to Pluto's. ?It serves mainly salads and sandwiches, but looks like more on the salads. ?I don't think it has as an extensive of a menu as Pluto's. The inside was open and conducive to chatting it up with your friends. ?It was a bit difficult for me to hear my friend as she was sitting on the other side of the table, so I had to either lean in closer or ask her to speak louder. ?But, we were one of the last around, so it got easier as the restaurant cleared out.

Well, now I go here a lot because a good pal LOVES it and they know her by name. But for me, its been: "I'm sorry, we're out of steak." OR "I'm sorry, we ruined the steak, and now we don't have any more. We didn't know how to cook it. What would you like (after waiting 25 minutes)" Or, arriving around 5:30 after work to watch them fill a large takeout order and simply ignore all of us who had placed orders who were actually in the restaurant. I waited 45 minutes for a salad, and left with a bonus migraine. And the stinginess continues. Night before last I got a salmon salad. One tablespoon of cheese, one tablespoon of corn, and some smashed brown avocado, onions too big to eat, and then the salmon, which has a carbon footprint that is ridiculous (why bring salmon from Scotland if we live on the Pacific?) That's $13.95 plus tax. Yum. If my friend didn't drag me here all the time, and if the guacamole and the tofu sides weren't fabulous, well...I'd be cranky. Imagine me cranky!

Similar to Plutos, you can create your own salad. ?But Sprout has way more selection to choose from and they also have a standard menu in case you feel lazy and don't want to go the custom route. ?I ordered the Somen Noodle Salad straight from the menu and it was great! ?The price was a little high considering I had no protein in my salad, but the portion was good. ?I also like that they have cucumber water! ?Yum!

Service is kinda like the Counter - you fill out a form if you want a custom salad or order something off the menu. I got a customized salad and my BF had a sandwich with ham & cheese (it had a small side salad also). He said it was just ok - nothing special or remarkable about it. It was boring and bland. My salad could be described the same way - just OK, nothing remarkable or memorable about it. The only redeeming quality was that the salad greens were fresh and the side bread was pretty fresh also. This place is overpriced considering the fact you have to pay extra for every little thing (avocado, etc.). The only good thing is that it wasn't as loud as Pluto's. The cucumber water was weird. I would have preferred lemon water, or a fruity water (strawberry, orange, etc). Panera Bread and Pluto's are way better (more variety and spice to it).

I just grabbed my late lunch from Sprouts so there was no line - wooohooo! I have never heard of Sprouts before until this past Monday when they catered to my work place. I was really impressed with the variety and freshness of the vegetables and salad mix so I decided that I would make sure to swing by the place on my own. I can totally understand the reviews that point out that the wait could be potentially long. Given that I was the only person in line, it did not take 20 mins but I could definitely see it taking a long time during the lunch hour rush. This place is basically the Palo Alto version of Mixt Greens in SF. So far so good, veggies are yummy and the guy got my order right!

Went to sprout for lunch and it was absolutely awesome! My favorite orders are the Chipotle Chicken Sandwich and the Steak Sandwich. The Chipotle Chicken Sandwich is my absolute favorite because I really enjoy the grilled chicken texture and flavors. When you bite into the sandwich, you notice how juicy the chicken is, yet there is no grease dripping into small puddles on your plate...very impressive. I also like it for the mouth-kicking flavoring. The "Chipotle" sauce is the ultimate in flavoring; the 180 degree opposite of bland! I'm sure not everyone would order a steak or chicken sandwich if they come for healthy eats. But I always feel healthier when I leave than when I walk in. For others, a popular option is to "build a salad." In this category, you fill out a form and they assemble the salad. This is an ultra high-end salad and isn't what you'd expect for "healthy" eats. Originally, Sprout was rated four stars, but over time, I've come to realize that this is a five star lunch spot.

My husband and I finally got around to trying Sprout Cafe for dinner last Friday night, and we weren't disappointed. ?We got two salads: I had one simply called "Fruity" and he had the "Somen Noodle". The Fruity salad was our favorite. ?This was a big bowl full of fresh greens with strawberries, apple slivers, and candied walnuts, finished off with an excellent dressing that didn't overwhelm either in taste or quantity (don't you hate getting an over-dressed salad where the last few bites are totally saturated in dressing?). The Somen Noodle salad was also good, though a tiny bit bland for my taste. ?The flavoring on the noddles (of which there was a prodigious quantity) was very, perhaps excessively, subtle. ?In addition to soft, cooked noodles there were also some little crunch noodle bits, plus greens and a few other veggies, but it was really about the noodles. ?Good, but not great. The strawberry lemonade was perfect. ?Sweet but not too sweet, plenty of strawberry flavor. ?Our only complaint is that we had to remind our waiter we'd ordered it after our salads arrived with no drinks. ?Small price to pay for a great treat. I'm definitely planning to include Sprout Cafe in our regular out-to-eat rotation.

If you love Pluto's, you will LOVE Sprout! Same concept, but better for a number of reasons: 1) There is a salad menu. So if you're not the "build your own salad" type of person, then this will appeal to you. I usually like to add my own toppings, but I opted to try the Fruity Salad, which was mixed greens, seasonal fruit (strawberry, blueberry, apple, orange...), candied walnuts, cheese in a vinaigrette dressing. LOVED it! 2) If you opt to build your own salad, there is a convenient check-list for you to fill out with what you want (kinda like how you build burgers at The Counter). 3) There are a ton of sandwich options! My friend got the Chipotle Chicken sandwich -- so tasty! And the bread is awesome. 4) Small bites! We shared the fried calamari. Yummy! Pluto's will always have a special place in my heart but Sprout has won me over! So when I'm in PA and looking for a healthy meal, you can find me here :)

Yes, I'm definitely a fan! If you like Pluto's for their extensive salad topping selection and a healthy and yet delicious way to take vegatbles, here is your new spot. Similar to the well-known Pluto's, you can select your own leaf, toppings, meat choice and dressing. They also offer fixed salads (the Somen, I recommend), sandwiches and an assortment of espresso/tea drinks. I would say a little more pricier ($10-$12 a salad) than Pluto's but definitely a good alternative.

This is one of those places where you pay upfront, grab a number, and servers will bring out your items. ?Service is decent and consistent. ?Minus one star for pricing. ?Sprout Cafe is a few dollars more than some of its salad bar competitors, but I love the fresh produce and unique salad menu.

Awesome place for healthy food, which I find is hard to come by when dining out. Ingredients are fresh and there are lots of options. However... they are docked one star because if you order anything besides salad, it takes FOREVER for the food to arrive. If you order salads with a group, the salads might arrive as much as 5 minutes apart.

Sprout is a nicely designed salad cafe in downtown PA. My new favorite location for good unique sized salad. Their sandwiches are well cooked with lots of contrast in texture and juices.

Yum! Great custom made to order salads, with over 20 items to choose from and over 10 dressings. I came in around 11:45AM today and the place was already starting to have a line. Got a salad with butter lettuce, tofu, alfalfa sprouts, almonds, quinoa, red onion and tomatoes with soy ginger vinaigrette. I also had a bowl of organic clam chowder. My food came out promptly, though my friend JT's did not. Her soup came out with mine, and then we waited at least another 10 mins for her ham and cheese sandwich to come out. My meal cost a little over $12 for the custom salad and soup. By the time we sat down to eat, the place was completely packed with a line almost out the door. I think this place is waaaay better than Plutos. I don't even think there's a comparison unless you are value oriented, then you will like Plutos more since it is cheaper. The salad choices are a vegetarian's dream, with seasonal ingredients like pomegranate seeds that you can't find in typical salad bar. My only complaint as a vegetarian is that the sandwich choices for veggies is not so broad. Just eggplant sandwich? What about a veggie burger or tofu sandwich? Otherwise--food is fresh and ?tasty. I'm definitely a fan! Just don't come here during peak lunch hours or order in advance.

Sorry Pluto's, Sprouts is officially my one and only true love. I used to be a die hard Pluto's fan - that is, until I tried Sprouts. Now, going back to Pluto's is a big giant disappointment! Sprouts needs to open a new location in San Jose so I can get my salad fix! Sprouts is better than Pluto's because they have soooo many more choices and their dressings are to die for. The only reason Sprouts loses a star is because it is more expensive than Pluto's, but then again, you get what you pay for, right??? Definitely skip Pluto's and head straight to Sprouts. Great...now I'm hungry!

Proof that Sprout's salads are awesome: My dad -- who is unequivocally anti-salad -- wolfed down a Rocky salad (grilled chicken, baby spinach & arugula, gorgonzola, roasted red bell peppers, fried onions, egg, apples, grapes, cherry tomatoes, ranch dressing) and remarked begrudgingly, "This is actually pretty good." One tip: Stick with Sprout's signature salads, with flavor/ingredient combinations that have already been thoroughly vetted and road-tested. You may think that you can throw together a custom salad that's even better than what's already on the menu, but resist the urge. It'll cost you more -- for example, if you get the Steakhouse salad (grilled marinated tri-tip steak, hearts of romaine, apple-wood smoked bacon, fried onions, roasted potatoes, black beans, gorgonzola, caesar dressing), you'll pay $9.75, but if you choose to customize and put together the exact same salad, it'll set you back $11.90. If you really want to change it up, Sprout'll let you add and subtract a couple of ingredients from the signature salads. Another reason not to customize: Your new invention will probably taste gross, and you'll have no one to blame but yourself.

I've been wanting to try Sprout for a really long time, ever since I heard it compared to the wonderful Intermezzo / Smart Alec's salad choices on the better side of the Bay. I knew it would be more expensive like everything else over here but I expected to get my money's worth in quantity, quality, and flavor. I opted to make my own salad. Romaine with the sesame-miso dressing and cucumbers, edamame, corn, bean sprouts (didn't realize I wanted alfalfa sprouts instead oops), grilled chicken. The dressing sounds nice in theory but the miso was kind of chunky so I just got a strange grainy sensation from it. It tastes good though. The chicken, like many have said before me, is dry and bland. But it complements an otherwise-equally bland salad. The portion size is good, but for almost $10 it's not worth it. God.. I could get two salads at intermezzo and two gigantic chunks of bread for this. I could get two Smart Alec's salads with two delicious blocks of cornbread! Instead I get a salad that yes, looks very pretty and comes with a mushy piece of bread and a nicer dining environment. But they are also slow at Sprout. Tried the butternut squash soup, which was good, but should not cost $5. Don't get coffee here, you'd probably be happier with Starbucks or Peets or any other cafe a few blocks away. I am being really stingy in this review but when you've had affordable and delicious greens, you don't really feel right betraying your first love that never did you any wrong.

This is a great place for a salad. They've been open for nearly 4 weeks now and I go frequently enough to see that they are taking whatever suggestions and implementing them well. The place is set up well and can fit more people than their competitor down the street. You walk to the counter and fill out a card. The salads (as of 9/1) are $6.95 to start. There are included ingredients and premium ingredients for extra $. The reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of their service. During the rush of lunch hour (12-2), it takes a full hour from walking in the door. If you watch how they make the salads, all they do is throw in your choices, toss it and serve. So I don't see why it takes so long... except for the added rush. I'm sure this will be sorted out since they're fairly new. The other reason for the 4 stars is price and ingredients. I love the variety of ingredients, but it does seem like there are a few missing items that are a staple in most salads. I've also stopped getting grilled steak because it's way over priced for the amount you get and it's not very tasty. My friend did get the tofu which was very good. I might try that next time. As an appetizer, their pork pot stickers are fantastic. All though, these too are over priced so I don't normally get them. I believe they are $6.95 for 6.

I tried this with a friend. ?I had the Tofu Signature Salad. ?It was DELICIOUS. The tofu was middle-of-the-road firm, and the breading was perfectly seasoned. Everything was so fresh, and the portions were large too! ?My friend ordered the Soba Noodle Signature Salad. Also a winner, not too much dressing, just enough to add the right amount of flavor. ? I live a few blocks away and will definitely choose this place over down-the-street Pluto's anyday...

Just like Pluto's but better! ?Or at least in my opinion. ?Every time I go to Pluto's, it seems so chaotic there. ?I think coming to Sprouts on a relaxing weeknight definitely contributed to my overall experience. ?Plus the decor is trendier and less colorful and kiddy. A big mistake I made was actually attempting to try to read the big menu board because the font is so faint that I couldn't see anything. ?I should have picked up a take out menu. ?I thought about making a custom salad but with SO many choices, I was overwhelmed and just stuck with a pre-set one. ?We started out with a freshly made strawberry lemonade ($2.25) and boy oh boy can you taste the lemons!! ?They're straight off the tree. ?I liked that it wasn't OD'ed with sugar. ?For our main fare, my bf and I ended up splitting a Tuna Nicoise Salad ($9.95) and a Tri-Tip Steak Sandwich ($8.75). ? The Tuna Nicoise Salad... which apparently no one can ever pronounce, contains pepper crusted seared ahi tuna, butter lettuce, green beans, roasted potatoes, kalamata olives, egg, cherry tomatoes, crispy onions, and ranch dressing. ?I'm actually not sure how true the description is to the actual item because there were no roasted potatoes or crispy onions, the ranch dressing tasted different, and not all the cherry tomatoes were ripe. ?Even though the ranch dressing tasted different, it still tasted butter and good! ?You get four 2.5" pieces of tuna and they were seared quite lovely... just on the edges and I don't know the exact contents of the crust it with but some bites had a nice kick to it. ?I did wish there were more generous slices though because we really had to ration them out and not devour all of it within the first couple bites. Now I definitely enjoyed the Tri-Tip Steak Sandwich which had crispy potatoes, sauteed corn, lettuce, mayonnaise, on an acme ciabatta. ?Having this on acme bread makes SUCH a big difference because even though I was unaware of where it was from, I kept thinking and saying what awesome bread it was. ?Quality definitely shines through. ?It was thick and firm inside but crispy on the outside. ?I couldn't get enough. ?Everything in this sandwich definitely vibed with one another...even the mayo tasted great. ?The meat itself was on the leaner side so don't expect too much falling apart or juicing action. Staff was mostly noninvasive. ?You just go up to the counter to give them your custom salad sheet or your order. ?You bring a number to your table, they bring your food, and they clear it after you've finished. ?That's about it but it was fine. ?At first I wasn't sure how long it would take for our food to come out since there was only one woman preparing the salads and it looked like she had quite some more orders to fill but we waited about 8-10 minutes or so. ?Not bad. **OTHER TASTY THINGS TO ORDER: Southwestern Salad Spicy Chipotle Chicken Sandwich Sesame Crispy Tofu

Right when I stepped into Sprout, I felt like I had just stepped into my own garden of romaine lettuce, green sprouts, basil and all them vegetables you can grow in your own yard. Of course, I don't have one, but that was how it felt like. The salad menu was much vast than the sandwich menu. I usually opt for salads, but today I was feeling rather adventurous for something delicious.. cheesy and bursting with flavors. I ended up sharing a steak salad and the chipotle chicken sandwich. My my my.. .. the salad dressing was a bit too suttle for my taste, but the steak was yummy! It was seasoned and grilled just right. As for the chipotle sandwich, the sauced chicken w/ fontina cheese pressed against two pieces of white sturdy bread was delicioso! I'm partial to any kind of panini like sandwich; however, this was a good meal w/o feeling too heavy at the end. On a more disappointing note though, the green iced tea tasted nothing like green tea. The only thing that reminded me of green tea was the color of the drink-- it was murky green. Something funky was just going on with the tea... meh. I'd come back to try the other salads if I am ever in the city again. I remembering eyeing ?the ahi tuna ?and a chicken risotto like salad on my way to the cashier... mmmm . I'd like to give those a try.

This place reminds me of Tender Greens in LA, but it's better. ?It's sort of like Pluto's also, but I like being able to have a paper where you check off all the items you want. ?It makes it much less likely that they'll mess up your order. The greens are fresh, and the fruit was super sweet, especially strawberries. ?The herbed chicken breast is really flavorful. ?My only complaint is that when you add protein, they only give you 4 slices of whatever it is (tuna, chicken, etc). ?They have lots of other toppings available, too - like special sprouts, different cheeses, nuts, etc. The steak sandwich had too much bread for the filling. ?On its own, the steak had more flavor, but texture wise, it was more like roast beef. ? Lots of cool drinks available, too.. along with pop chips, bars, cookies, etc. ?Beer and wine available, too :)

I'd eat almost anything if there were a layer of Sprout's furikake-crusted tofu sitting on top of it. The egg white omelet is also quite tasty. My only gripe is the somewhat steep prices. I've also been told that their croque monsieur sandwich is less than stellar, but all the salads I've tried here have been fantastic. My favorite salads: steakhouse, tofu, and Kyoto.

I love this place! I love the concept, the create-your-own-salad idea, the atmosphere, everything! I've only been there once, but I was charmed by it from the get-go. As some other reviewers have mentioned, it does have the concept of Counters, where you can custom-create your meal, except that it's for salads. I heart salads, and I'm so happy my friend suggested this place. The concept is not new. I mean create-your-owns have been around for some time, but this place has the sophistication of "I come here to be seen and to be healthy". The "kitchen" is completely open so you'll see them make your salad in front of you (if you want. they bring the order to your table). The layout is very clean and open, creating a lot of space for small & big groups. I'm not in downtown PA a lot, but if I'm ever in the area, I'll definitely want to come back and try more of their salads or even their specialty soups and sandwiches. *thumbs up.

Don't panic, it's organic! First of all I would like to praise Sprout Cafe for having healthy organic choices and for giving a variety of endless options for your salad. This place can get pretty busy, so I would opt for coming in around 11am when they open. However, if you come during rush-hour traffic...as in lunchtime for 9-5 workers...then prepare yourself! This place gets insanely busy. I love this place because they cater to picky little brats, such as myself. -The ingredients are fresh. -Salads are filling. -The options are endless. I like how they have a self service water pitcher handy. Buyer beware.....who ever knew that a salad could get super expensive!

I have heard about Sprout from my hubby who works nearby. ?He decided to take me for our anniversary lunch and let me in on the secret of "all things salad". ?Dare I say this place is like FC on steroids? ? Loved it. ?Made my own salad - had no idea it would be the size of a Buick. ?I felt like I ate forever and never made a dent. ?Ended up bringing some home for an afternoon graze. ?Next time I'll give the soups and sangwiches a try. Only bummer: we ordered by 11:50a and didn't get our salad until around 12:35p. ?(note: we were told it would take about 20 minutes until our order was ready) ?However, it was PACKED the entire time so that tells me it's a good place. ?Just hard to relax and enjoy when you're on a time crunch. ?Saw lots of people coming in and taking food away, so that might be another way to get food a little quicker.

Palo Alto's version of Mixt Greens. For the salads you pick your lettuce, choice of 6 toppings, choice of dressing (and of course can pay extra for whatever else you want). Served with a piece of whole wheat french bread on the side. Toppings range from fruit to veggies to cheese to tofu, etc. Prices are VERY reasonable & the atmosphere is nice. I love the cucumber water! Definitely not as good as Mixt Greens in SF (not as many topping choices), but I would definitely go back & probably will.

Seriously, this place is fab. ?First of all, way better than Plutos. ?Something about Plutos just throws me. ?I always feel panicked and rushed trying to pick my salad ingredients...they never match the list they give you. ?Sprout is different. ?You fill out your order FIRST and no one is rushing you around. ?Not to mention they have amazing ingredients. I'm pretty sure they are sick of seeing my face every day since I work one block from them. The one con I have is that they sometimes forget ingredients. ?That particularly bothers me when i've paid extra for something (say, roasted brussel sprouts or sauteed mushrooms). ?They've also given me a different ingredient than the one I paid for. ? Prices are a bit high--not my favorite. ?But in the end, a great lunch, great salad, great soups, healthy and fresh!!

I ate here for the first time yesterday and I can't wait to go back! I had the tofu salad which contains edamame, bean sprouts, carrots and lots of other yummy stuff. On top there were two generous wedges of crusted, sauteed tofu. It was dressed with a tangy, light, soy vinaigrette. Crispy veggies + warm crunchy tofu + tangy dressing = tears of joy! My friend had the Nicoise salad which looked delicious (thinly sliced ahi tuna, soft-boiled egg, good olives). She said it was great but I didn't taste it. My only complaint is that there was a several minute gap between when my friend's salad was delivered and when mine showed up and it wasn't a busy time of day. But I won't hold that against them as long as they keep cranking out the tofu salads.

So Palo Alto is the suburban hellhole---you can't manage it only on foot. ?But as car-dependent suburbia goes, it's pretty much the top of things. ?Sprout is why. ?An upscale take on the "build your own" concept for salads, the main thing is that it's fast and the ingredients are really fresh. ?My seared tuna Ni?oise was really tasty and came quickly enough to make heading over to University not a huge drag on a work day. Fast. ?Fresh. ?Not greasy. ?Reasonably priced? ?I wish Philly had lunch places like this.

My instant reflex for lunch is never salads, which is what Sprout prides itself on: their ingredients, their variety, their freshness. ?Still, this doesn't mean they don't pay attention to the rest of their menu items - their sandwiches are wonderful! ?(Although I must say, the salads look amazingly huge and very filling.) They keep their concept and execution simple: no fuss, no muss. ?I'm never waiting in line for very long - but then again, I've always ordered directly from the menu, never having taken the time to "create my own sandwich/salad/smorgasbord". ?I do appreciate it as an option though! After ordering, you take a number, and find a table. ?Lunchtime obviously gets quite busy, so don't expect to go grab a table for more than four people. ?But a table for two: perfect. I love their take on the tri-trip steak sandwich. ?Each time I've had it, the steak has been nice and warm, with a textured crunch from the crispy potatoes, and the corn brings an appropriate amount of sweetness. ?Bread is fresh, and I appreciate the small side salad too. Their Summer Rolls (chicken) are decent as well. ?Quite refreshing, but of course nothing like their true Vietnamese compatriots. Just be forewarned: their home-made strawberry lemonade is pretty darn sweet.

It's really difficult to say anything negative about this place. ?I just went there for the first time today after much cajoling from my girlfriend (she hadn't been there either but she'd heard great things about the place). ? When you walk through the front doors there are these little clip boards where you check off what you want in your salad. ?It's kind of like a better version of what Plutos offers down the street. ?The only problem I had with this system is that you can't really see the ingredients from the entrance. I selected the ingredients that I wanted and added grilled tuna for $3.50 extra. ?After that I took my form to the fellow at the counter. ?He was incredibly helpful and friendly and even allowed my girlfriend to taste test a number of the dressings before she selected which one she wanted (yeah, she's THAT girl). ?I also ordered a cup of buttenut squash soup to go with my salad. Even though you order at a counter, the food is brought to you (note to Yelpers who reviewed this place...that does NOT count as waiter service :P). ?The soup was excellent. ?Probably the best butternut squash soup I've ever had. ?It was pleasantly spicy and was served nice and hot (I realize that's how soup is supposed to be served but you'd be surprised how many times I've been served lukewarm soup in a resturant). ? My salad was fantastic. ?Everything was so fresh and well put together. ?Plutos' ingredients tend to be a bit soggy when all mixed together, everything here was incredibly crisp and crunchy, exactly how a salad should be. ?The tuna was perfectly prepared (grilled dark on the outside, pink and raw in the middle). The place is very clean and neat. ?Not only the sanitation factor but the decor as well. ?It's nice but rather spartan and cold. ?Not overly warm but that's just my tastes. The only thing preventing this place from being 5 stars is the price. ?Yes, it's good but not quite worth what they charge. ?My girlfriend and I ordered 2 salads, 1 cup of soup, and a bottle of Pellegrino and our total was $35.72. ?I don't mind paying a lot for a good meal but I believe you should get what you pay for. ?Not sure if it was worth that much.

I came across Sprout Cafиж yesterday at the Palo Alto street fair, having walked couple hours, me and my friends thought what would be a good place to eat in a weather that's so damn hot and humid. Ummmm *cold summer salad!* A bean salad sounded perfectly refreshing for me, as soon we stepped inside of Sprout Cafe, my eyes filled with 40+ different ingredients or so displaying on the counter bins. Turns out, they have built your own salad as part of their menu. I immediately WOW'd. I was trying to think of flavor combos to use, and in my "I'm melting" state of stupor, I wanted to use Mache lettuce, it is a flavor that reminds me of summer and hotdays so it was perfect, then I picked somen noodles and roasted peanuts, because Peanutty noodles = the best combination of flavor and texture!! (in my opinion), I also had it set in my head that I wanted to use chili lime dressing, which screams refreshing (and Margaritas-but that's for another time =)) and would keep me cool. Using those four flavors to start with, I built it up adding mangos, cherry tomatoes, a tiny bit of mozzarella cheese. Oh, and of course peppered seared tuna. I threw this together on that Sunday afternoon and it was amazingly delicious. The price came to 10.50, I thought it was a decent price considering the amount of Mache lettuce they gave me. Oh I almost forgot, their fresh squished carrot juice is one of the tasty drink I have tried in years. Plus it's inexpensive and quick to make! The service was great, I didn't think they had waiter service, but then they'd bring the dishes out to me and my friends while we were just chatting and relax at the outdoor table. I have always been to Mixt Green for my Salad, because i live in San Francisco. I don't think I will think for more then a sec that I will not attempt to drive 30min just to come back here again and try to build the other 3 combo ingredient my friends suggested.

Been here a couple times now and not sure why people think it is actually good. ?Had salads both times - the first one was the Cobb and it was average. ?Second was a simple Caeser salad with anchovies (to go) and I was pretty disappointed (not to mention they forgot the anchovies). The real issue is the setup and service. ?There's no semblance of a line and they take orders as fast as possible - this leaves a mob of people hanging about the counter. ?The staff seems to run around like chickens with their heads cut off. ?It's also extremely slow. ?I'd say their manager/owner needs to take a visit up to SF and see how Mixt Greens runs a line. Maybe the secret is to order ahead, and only sandwiches.

Great food that's always made fresh. I've had many of their sandwiches and salads which you can expect to be fresh...but just found out today that thier Asian Chicken Noddle soup is made every time someone orders instead of being scooped from a big batch. I'd recommend the Tuna Nicoise (anything with the searhed ahi tuna), asian chicken noodle soup and the chipotle sandwich, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

Went again, this time with my husband. He thought his turkey sandwich (with interesting mix of cranberries, cream cheese, and pesto) was very very tasty, as was the side-salad that came with it. But we did notice a number of oddities about this place, especially since we ate there instead of getting our food to go. BTW it was nearly empty on a Wed night, which is unfortunate since the food itself is quite good. 1) Ordering is unnecessarily complicated. Teeny tiny font everywhere, and it seems inefficient for the salad "chefs" to have to look at the paper, toss one topping in, look at the paper again, toss in the next topping, and on and on and on. The person working at the counter also had to come to my table and tell me they were out of one of the ingredients I'd chosen, which seems like an inevitable complication if they're trying to use seasonal, fresh items but have printed checklists. Just let me point and have them throw it in, like Pluto's. 2) There is exactly one salt shaker, one pepper shaker, and one pepper grinder for the ENTIRE restaurant. They are located next to the ordering counter. So, after you get your food, you either have to carry your plate to the counter in order to add salt and pepper to it, or you can walk to the counter, bring the shakers to your table, and then go put them back right away for everyone else. Several customers (including me) were parading back and forth last night doing this. 3) Yes it's very clean, but almost too much so. It's like they're performing surgery or doing scientific research back there, with the bright white lights, and the gloves, and their painstakingly careful handling of everything, and each item individually labeled and wrapped. Just toss my food together and let's go! It's a salad. A little messiness is okay.

It's a very pricey salad bar. The basic salads cost about 8 bucks and once you pile up some meats, cheeses or things that they consider extra toppings you can quickly get a 20 bucks salad (since when beets and butternut squash are considered special toppings???) We ordered two salads which were fresh. The butternut squash that I added was dry and not tasty. The rest were good. the butternut squash soup was horrible. It was cold, and after they reheat it, it was so boring. Not worth the 4.95 I paid. Oren had the Tri Tip sandwich which was pretty huge, the meat was a little bit dry, but it was still tasty. It has some potato chips inside (weird) and it's pricey (~$9) In short, yes, it's a nice place but not affordable enough for lunch. Pluto's is cheaper and the quality isn't really behind.

Like pluto's except better because you don't feel like your crammed in tiny chairs along with half the population of Palo Alto. No weird astronaut decor either. I had the fruity salad (a specialty salad on the menu) which comes with sesame ginger dressing. Loved the walnuts, goat cheese, strawberries, apples, blueberries, and oranges. I basically could not get the salad into my mouth fast enough. Slightly more expensive than Pluto's but worth it. Oh, also we had the pork potstickers but they were really heavy and greasy. avoid!

"Sprouts" - doesn't that just conjure up images of green live things? I loved Sprouts and the verdant feeling of the place. Appropriately named for a salad and sandwich shop, this cafe is tres mignon. You walk in and are greeted by a long table holding clipboards. If you want to design your own salad, proceed to filling out the paper order. You choose between type of greens, 6 free toppings, and additional priced ingredients (aka meats +$1.95), and dressing, etc. Half orders start at $5.25 or so. Full orders at $6.95. For someone like me, the options are daunting. So I skipped all that and proceeded to the menu board. There were about 10-12 "pre-made" salads to choose from. I went with the Papaya Salad for $8.25. Loaded with shredded green papaya, carrots, mixed greens, red onions and jicama junks, the salad tasted super fresh. Loved it. It was also enormous. More than enough for one person. Comes with a slice of fresh hearty bread. Would definitely go back. Free wifi too.

Holy friggin' crap. This place is like Cafe Intermezzo in Berkeley, except not populated with smelly hippies and an easily accesible entrance that isn't blocked by the billion bikes parked outside. I have been DYING for a great salad since leaving Berkeley. Sprout delivers on all counts. I got the Southwestern because I am convinced that smoked applewood bacon sprinkled over my salad is a substantial amount of meat for lunch, and did not opt for the tri-tip (which Josh K. ordered on his salad and was subsequently terribly disappointed by). Oh god. The corn. So sweet, so crunchy, so flavorful. The red onions so pungent my coworkers paid for it later. Cheddar, beans, tortilla strips, god, what a meal! I left this place high as a kite, convinced that no other salad would ever compare. Pluto's is good, but not THIS good. I need to come back and try more stuff before I can bump this up to 5 stars, but until then, I'm giving it 4.5 (rounding down).

Good, but really expensive for what you get. My dinner of a soup and sandwich was $16 (with tax and tip). The sandwich was very tasty. I got their Croque Monsieur, which is essentially a ham and grilled cheese sandwich. It was a damn good ham and grilled cheese sandwich, but it was, nonetheless, a ham and grilled cheese sandwich that cost $8 (before tax and tip). The butternut squash soup was also gratifying and made me feel all warm and cozy. I liked the little kick of cayenne pepper since the soup would have otherwise been too bland. However, I think that $6 for that soup was far too expensive. My friend got the Asian chicken noodle and the Portabella Mushroom sandwich. I really liked the Asian chicken noodle soup; it had a good ginger and dried onion (I think?) flavor. Also, no MSG. The Portabella Mushroom sandwich was good, but it tasted really weird when taking a bite of it right after my Croque Monsieur since the two sandwiches have such different flavors and textures. In short, I liked it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. If I was in the area and really craving this particular brand of food (salad/soup/sandwiches), I would most likely come here. The lack of any sort of "must come again" feeling = 3 stars.

For a person on the Paleo (caveman) diet, there couldn't be a better restaurant for me than Sprout. ?A plethora of fresh salads to choose from, made from organic ingredients, and some terrific soups as well--butternut squash, for one. ?I'm glad that such a restaurant exists for a person like me, and I'm glad that all of their ingredients are so fresh and their creations are so delicious--undoubtedly a place that I will be frequenting on a regular basis in the near future. Tip to first-timers: Sprout is extremely popular during lunch, so make sure to arrive a decent amount before noon (11:30 or so should suffice) to avoid the large lines.

The GF and i came to Sprout last Sunday night after a weekend in Tahoe skiing, drinking beer, and eating burgers. We agreed on the drive back that we should visit some place with food that was just a tad healthier for dinner. One thing you should be warned of before going: about 80% of the people eating there will be image conscious, calorie counting, stanford sorority girls wearing ugg boots and sweat pants, talking on their cell phones, and chowing down on monster 1500 calorie salads while they stress out about school. I guess it was closer and had more salad options so they just stopped going to Pluto's. Anyway, it was a little shocking, so be warned. Also, their salads are HUGE. If you are planning on getting a salad to cut calories order light dressing (light in terms of amount, you can order light or heavy) and split it with someone or take half of it home. Seriously, if you order heavy dressing you'll get like half a bottle of dressing. So here's what we got: Butternut Squash Soup with Cayenne Pepper and Creme Freche (Daily Special): I love butternut squash soup, but i also have really high standards for some reason. This was a solid offering. It could have used a bit more salt and something sweet to balance the heat of the cayenne, but overall very solid. Pot Stickers: very good, but pretty standard. Nothing here you won't find at any other place that does pot stickers. After we finished this dish, i was kind of feeling buyer's remorse and thinking we should have gotten the lettuce wraps. Not that the pot stickers were bad, just not great. Chipotle Chicken Sandwich: Done in a panini style this sandwich is probably one of the better sandwiches you can get on University. Really fantastic. The tortilla strips could be huge and totally distract you from the rest of the sandwich, but someone was paying attention and made them small so you only get a little bit of the flavor and some delightful crunch. Its going to be hard to get myself to order any of the other sandwiches after how good this one was. Overall, i think we'll definitely be coming back. Prices were higher than Plutos, but not by much. A huge bowl of soup, appetizer of pot stickers, and sandwich ran about $23, which for University Ave isn't bad at all. I like the serve yourself water, but its current placement means that area gets clogged up with people waiting to order food. Food was good, service was good, prices were reasonable. I imagine we'll be coming back quite a bit when we're in that casual sandwich/soup/salad mood.

I've been a long time fan of Sprout ever since it opened. ?It is a "build-your-own-salad" place and the ingredients are very fresh. ?You can even try out all the various exotic choices before you pick. ?If you are less of the adventurous type, they also have pre-made salads on their menu which are equally delicious. I find that the portions are good for salads (might not be enough for a guy since my boyfriend is still hungry afterwards) and their butternut squash soup is amazing - a must if you're a fan of the soup. The service is very friendly and quick. ? The atmosphere is clean, bright, and fast-paced. ?If you're going during peak times (lunch and dinner) be prepared to stand in line since they get a lot of business. ?If you're ever in downtown PA and looking for a good place to eat, definitely try Sprout.

This is one of my favorite places for brunch and lunch. Sprout offers a wide selection of salads (either order off the menu or build your own), sandwiches and a choice of 2-3 daily soups daily. Though it is on the pricier side, for a salad connoisseur like me, the quality of the ingredients makes it worth it! For build your own salads: - Decide if you'd like a full or a half salad (full will start at $6.95 while half at $5.25). - Choose from greens such as butter lettuce (yum! and a rarity at most salad places), baby spinach, arugula and of course your staple mixed greens, romaine and lettuce. - Pick six add-in's for your salad including cherry tomatoes, sweet corn, different cheese (they have fresh buffalo mozzarella!), a hard-boiled egg, somen noodles, sunflower seeds, etc. - Choose premium toppings for $0.50-$1 more (think avocado) - Finally, pick your protein and choose from steak, ahi tuna, poached salmon and of course chicken (extra $ for these toppings of course). - Lastly, pick your dressing. If you're too lazy to customize your plate, you can choose from the salads listed on their menu, which are equally delicious and -I think- more bang for the buck! ? I usually get the salmon though I love their steak and ahi tuna as well. If I go for the half portion, my total will run about $10 for a small salad ($5.25 + $3.95); so it adds up quickly. ?Add a soup and a drink, you're looking at shelling out close to $20 for a cafe lunch. Overall, I'd say it's a classier and more organic version of Pluto's (great sandwiches, horrible salads), so whenever I'm in need of a "detox" to get my diet back on track, I stop by Sprout!

In Sprout's defense, I'm not their target customer. I don't really like salads. I've been there twice for sandwiches and both times felt a little disappointed and a little ripped off. The croque monsieur is a very straight-forward ham and cheese sandwich, and not a very good one at that. The whole place has a vibe that rubs me the wrong way. Service is average and... snooty is too strong, maybe aloof.

Delicious! It was a cold and wet weekend in the Bay Area this week, but I really wanted to get out and have lunch with some friends that were home for the long weekend. Someone suggested Sprout Cafe in downtown Palo Alto for a change of scenery and pace from the usual lunch spots. Guys, this place is a pretty cool spot to have lunch. They have a very good selection of creative salads and tasty appetizers. If a sandwich is your thing, try the Tri-tip Steak sandwich. The portions of the salads here are quite huge. They're freshly made at the front so you can see your order being created; it's really mouth-watering just thinking about it again (at 12:03am while I'm writing this, no doubt). I'm going to give this place 3 stars only because the price of the dishes is somewhat high. I ordered a Tri-tip sandwich, lemonade, and the potstickers and I quickly got to $20 bucks. You're partially just paying for the decor/location/PA-scene, which kind of turns me off, but the food was yummy. Would I go here again? Yes, but with a price-conscious group, it may not be such a hit. Is it worth a try? Definitely. I'm hungry now. :D

Eating at Sprout Cafe reminds me of eating at The Counter (substitute burger topping choices with salad choices). ?For $6.95, you get their large salad with choice of greens, 6 standard toppings and dressing. ?It was fun to get to pick exactly what you want. ?Meat toppings are extra - chicken pieces are $1.95 and tri-tip pieces are $2.95. ?I thought that the dish would have been a lot better if the meats were not served cold. ?Of all the dressing choices, they do have two kinds of non-fat and one low-fat dressings. ?I had the low-fat chile lime dressing and it tasted pretty good. Bottom Line: ?Nice salad but adding meat probably not a very good option.

Sprout is a great place to go when you're looking for a nice, healthy yet delicious lunch. ?Their signature salads are creative and delicious, and if there is nothing on the menu that speaks to you, you can always create your own with the HUGE number of ingredients that they have available. ? I had the Southwest salad yesterday. ?It was REALLY good (I especially loved the dressing!), but it could have used some chicken or steak to make it a bit more filling, especially for the price (it was around $10!). ?I had the Somen awhile ago, and it was also good. ? The cons include that it is quite pricey, especially for what you're getting. ?I create some DAMN good salads at the Whole Foods salad bar for a lot less. ?Also, the service is incredibly slow. ?We had to wait around 15-20 minutes to get our food since they were focusing on making the take-out meals. ?Also, if you come at the wrong time (read: peak lunch hours), the wait is long and you have to work really hard to get a table (it took us 15 minutes of using the divide and conquer scavenging method last time to find something). ?I would suggest coming before 11:45 (it was pretty empty when I got there at 11:30 yesterday) or after 1:30.

The food here was excellent. ?I ordered the sesame tofu and the shrimp lettuce wrap. ? The sesame tofu was delicious in its fried self and drenched in sesame sauce of some kind. ?Everything about the shrimp was fresh, except it wasn't what I expected. The ingredients was more akin to a shrimp spring roll with lettuce skin. ?I like my wrap crunchy and it wasn't crunchy. The only thing that bothered me were the little bugs that kept flying around over my table. ? I know. I know. More protein for your egg salad. No, I prefer not.

This place KILLS any other custom salad bar!!! (Like Pluto's). I eat here at least once a week cause it's 50 yards away from my work but most importantly because it is so damn good. Sorry Loving Hut, even though you're vegan and you're across the street, I can't say no to an amazing salad! All the ingredients they have here are really fresh, as is the leafy greens. They also have premium ingredients that cost a a little bit more but it's worth it. They even have like fried tofu and a number of other asian influenced ingredients. If you're really indecisive, they have a pretty worthy menu of specialty salads, sandwiches and sides. They also categorize their ingredients to make it easier to order when customizing your salad including nuts and fruits. Just be prepared for the wait around lunch time cause it can go out the door! It's worth the wait though! Ever since my company's HR person tried it with me, she's been ordering it for our catered lunches!

This is more of a 3.5-star review but I'm rounding up. I typically come here on my lunch break and get a salad or soup. ?The soups aren't exactly my flavor but I love their salads and all of the topping choices. ?My only problem with this place is that it can be a little slow when ordering food to-go. ?I typically like to go down to Pluto's to get my salads (they are way faster) but Sprouts is a lot closer. ?I made the mistake of ordering the gyoza one day and waited 20 minutes. ?Why it takes 20 minutes for a little order of gyoza is beyond me. ?It wasn't even very busy in there. ?I'll just stick to salads. ?Looking forward to tying their sandwiches one day!

Let me start by saying that I'm much more a burger kind of guy. I always laughed on my girlfriends for eating all these green leaves I can't even name. Although Sprout also has a line of sandwiches, if you read the other reviews here, you quickly understand that the place is all about its salads. And oh boy... what salads... You can choose form a great variety of salads, all with cool combination of greens, fruits and interesting salsas. For me it was without doubt the best salad I ever ate, and I actually thought of ordering another one. And remember when such a complement comes from a guy like me, it is actually worth much more. But wait... don't think that you found the perfect place for your next date. A combination of self service and a very simple and low key design makes it a much better place for lunch break than to a romantic dinner. Still... I wish they had a branch near my home... I know my mother would have thanked them for turning me into the greens :)

Was friend with Sauce and Sesame Seeds. Sauce was ?a little too salty and but still good. ? Spring Rolls: Very fresh, but nothing to write home about. Steak Sandwich: Good! Had sweet corn and steak was pretty tender. ? Portebello Sandwich: Not bad, but I liked the steak sandwich better. Butternut Squash Soup: ?Not very flavorful at all. Will skip next time. Maybe we should have taken the hint and like everyone else, ordered a salad. ?The salads looked huge compared to our food. ?Next time, that is definitely what I'll be trying.

This is a great place to grab a salad. The ingredients are fresh and the portions are huge! I love being able to customize my own salad - I usually mix cranberries, apple, pear, fennel, croutons and chicken in butter lettuce with balsamic vinaigrette. It's a very tasty salad and I LOVE the free bread that comes on the side. All that being said, the prices are definitely on the high side and some of the "premium ingredients" that they charge extra for aren't any more expensive than the ones that they offer for free (e.g. pears are free, but cranberries are $1 extra). There is definitely a lot of seating inside of Sprout, but the serve-yourself aspect of the place means that the tables and floor can get pretty messy.

The salads and sandwiches are great. ?I love how fresh the ingredients are and I have yet to find a salad dressing I don't like. ? Even some of the appetizer menu items like the fresh rolls are fantastic and you get 3 rolls for under $5. ? My only criticism is that when you call in your order you have to wait in the massive line because there is no pickup-only line. ?They have told me they are going to resolve this, but it's often annoying to stand in the line for 30 min when you called ahead. ?My suggestion, call from the back of the line.

My Palo Alto high school-er said this was the latest hot spot downtown. And it turned out that I liked this place a lot. Very high quality ingredients, good recipes and choices. Fun venue, with good service. My biggest problem was the high prices. The prices are are high even for Palo Alto, especially given the room's perceived vibe of casual dining. The food and its ingredients and service all support the prices (~$11). But the venue, the room, furniture, the counter, all said to me that the average lunch should be $6, not $11..

I don't care for foreign objects in my food. I've been a regular customer and always put up with the inconsistencies because I like the variety of salads, but my visit on 1/25/12 was my last. My salad had a piece of paper (large enough for a food prep person to see -- it was a corner of a menu -- how many hands had been on it?) AND a small piece of aluminum foil, both "tossed" in with the other ingredients. ICK! I pointed this out to the person at the register, who made a face and threw away the offending items.

WIth the recent weather being frigid and cold, the least appetizing thing anybody could suggest to me is a salad. But at the suggestion and persistence of my friends, I walked into Sprouts to feast on what would my last salad of 2010. I moseyed on in to find an open airy space busting at the rims with bowls of fresh ingredients. Sprouts runs a hybrid structure of Pluto and The Counter. They offer salads, sandwiches (hot and cold), and soup - they also offer you the option to make your own salad with a Counter-like clipboard. Pick your greens, up to six mix-ins, opt in for some premium ingredients, add a protein if it strikes your fancy, and finish it off with one of their many salad dressings. ? Order and pay at the counter, take your number and find a seat. On my plate: + cappuccino - served in a tall, but rotund mug, it was exactly what I needed to perk up my day. Nice bit of foam on top, without taking dominating my milk or espresso. + half portion of a toss-to-order salad of mixed greens, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, broccoli, edamame, toasted pumpkin seeds (delighful!), and quinoa with grilled tri-tip of beef with low fat sesame dressing on the side - absolutely THE best salad I've ever had to date. Beats Pluto's, beats Whole Foods, and beats other salad places I've frequented in LA. The price is right, the portion is plentiful, and the ingredients are amazingly fresh. If I were blind folded I would have thought I was eating straight from the farmer's market. The tomatoes were sweet, the broccoli bright green with a nice crunch. Crunchy edamame, perfectly toasted pumpkin seeds, and tender quinoa - I was in heaven! Tri-tip was served chilled, cut into nice bite-sized chunks, served medium rare. Yum yum yum Service is impeccable. The cashier was sweet and offered great suggestions for sandwiches for me to take away and even offered to set dressings and other condiments aside for my mom's sandwich to-go. Detail-oriented and customer-focused. I like it! Though a casual dining restaurant, I could easily see myself spending a few hours here catching up with friends. The airiness of the restaurant and set sandwich/salad menu combined with the freedom to toss-as-you please makes it so much easier to navigate than Pluto's (more cramped, ingredients sad looking). Coming back for more? Definitely. I've never had a salad lift my mood the way Sprouts did!

I headed out of Menlo on a rainy day last week determined to rendezvous with a bowl of hot, hearty, soul-filling gooeyness. And a salad. ?I was headed to Whole Foods off of University when I drove by what else but...Sprout Cafe. The sign said "Soups, Salads, and Sandwiches" or something of the sort. Recognizing that Sprout must've sprouted up after I moved out of the Bay area in 2008, I rolled the dice...and felt the fear in my enemies eyes. (Coldplay shoutout). The decor is very classy. Their layout seems very smart..very LAish. I got the southwestern salad & a bowl of corn chowder. ?The salad was very flavorful w/ nice presentation and a generous portion of chicken. ?I was expecting the soup to be broth based but the bowl that came out was filled with a cream based substance which was staring me in the eye and saying, "c'mon dude..just eat me. Dip some of that sourdough bread in me. No one hasta know." I panicked!! ?Ran back to the counter and they gladly replaced it with a bowl of the red curry lentil..which was phenomenal. Given that this place is a mile from my place, I'll def. be introducing the wifey to the Sprout. ?A great place for a quick healthy bite and a def. contender for our new local neighborhood "comfort food mecca".

I used to LOVE sprout because they offer so many healthy, yummy salads as well as good soups and sandwiches. However, in the past few months, they have gotten worse and worse about getting their ingredients right. The last few times I've come in here, they've made a mistake on our order. Too frequently, they either leave off an important ingredient in a salad, add something you didn't want, or mix in the dressing when you ordered it on the side. I understand that these things happen once in a while, but the fact that this kind of inattention is becoming the norm is very sad. Additionally, their seared tuna used to be delicious, but the last few times I've had it, it wasn't very fresh. If Sprout's management would step up to oversee the orders and make sure they're correct, this restaurant could be a real gem. I hope that happens soon~ Otherwise, I'll have to stop coming here.

This place is awesome!! I'm still thinking of that pulled pork sandwich. Yum~ Great place to get lunch on University or if you're ever in the mood for a great salad. Didn't get to try the salad though, but it looks really good and it's made fresh - made to order! I love the simplistic modern decor of this place. You place your order at the counter and they give you a number which you take to the table you want to sit at and then they bring you the food. My friend and I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the turkey sandwich. My fave was the pork one. Such an interesting combo of flavors. It was tangy but sweet. It has blueberries in there!! WOW~ The ciabatta bread was toasted just right crunch but not too flakey. The turkey sandwich was good too. The pesto was amazing, best pesto I've ever had on a sandwich. Also tried their calamari. Definitely not for one who can't handle spicy. This was quite quite spicy, could have used more lime. I want to come here more often after work to grab a bite to eat. So delicious it makes my mouth water just thinking about it.

I've eaten here a few times and have tried numerous items. Everything is very tasty but my absolute favorite is their pulled pork sandwich. The meat is super tender and flavorful!

Great salads. ?But they always seem to have some sort of customer service issue. ?And its happened enough times to make the yummy salads not worth it. ?LOUSY, LOUSY SERVICE and they cannot handle things when its busy. ?I'll stick with Plutos even though I slightly prefer the taste of Sprouts. Not worth it. And its one thing to make a mistake every so often. ?It happens. ?But some of the people who work there are so rude and its as if everything if your fault. ?Ugh. Ticks me off.

Marvelous. I had the BBQ pulled pork with blueberries, which was unusual but good. They accompanying salad was also nice. The portions are large enough to feel like you're getting enough food, but not excessively so. Atmosphere is nice.

Very tasty, if a bit pricey... Had the Steakhouse here recently and rather enjoyed it. ?The meat was very tender, but in short supply. ?The fried onions and gorgonzola were excellent touches... I'd suggest studying the menu in advance if possible. ?There are a lot of salad toppings available and the whole process can be daunting to the uninitiated. ?Popular with students and office workers, this place is prone to get backed up a bit during peak times. ?Definitely worthwhile, though...

Met a friend at Sprout for lunch and was not disappointed -- delicious! I love the concept of being able to make your own salad without having to actually *make* your own salad :-) ?From the choices of greens to the array of toppings, it is both overwhelming and exciting. ? The salad arrived at my table and did not disappoint. ?It was cold (as it should be), fresh, and delicious. ?There's nothing worse that ordering a salad that is lukewarm ... yuck. My friend ordered the lettuce wraps and thought they were good. ?The free cucumber water is very refreshing and worth getting (it's only a matter of time before they begin charging for it). The only hiccup we ran into was the non-delivery of our potstickers ... not sure where they went. ?Since we were nearing the end of our lunch, we finally approached the counter to inquire and were promptly brought them. ?They tasted good but were a bit lukewarm/cold. ? Overall, Sprout provides a great environment and healthy food choices. ?I wish I lived closer so I could eat there more often. ?Will definitely return to try sandwiches and soup next.

Clean and fresh are two words that come to mind. ?The space is nice, open, and spacious. ?All the ingredients in the salads are fresh. ?Pricing is pretty average. ?I wish they offered more toppings though. ?They have a decent selection, but maybe I'm spoiled living in NY where every salad place has almost every topping imaginable. ?Sprout could use a few more dressing options too. This place is very similar to Mixt Greens in SF. ?Overall good option for the area. My biggest gripe though is the wait! ?Dude, it's a salad, how long can it take to make? We waited 10 min+ for 3 salads and it wasn't that busy when we went. And we didn't order anything fancy or complicated. ?So if you come, make sure you're not a huge rush.

Food: 4 star Atmosphere: 4 star Service: eh, not much service here since you order at a counter Salad seemed like a perfect meal for this hot day. So, I did a yelp search and found Sprout. It turned out to be a good experience, definitely a restaurant worth going back to. I ordered the Somen salad. It was pretty good.. The taste wasn't too interesting, since it was mainly lettuce and noodles. My fiance ordered the Fruity salad, which was a lot better. I like the style of Sprout. All the ingredients are really fresh. I want to try several of their salads, and maybe sometime make my own! ?The prices are also quite reasonable. A meal here is cheaper than Fresh Choice, and probably much healthier. :) Salads are large enough for an entire meal. Oh, one thing I was impressed with: the coffee is from Barefoot, my most favorite coffee shop in the South Bay! Kudos to Sprout for getting such fine quality espresso!

If you've been following my reviews, you'll know that there's a special place in my heart for tasty animals, and especially bacon. Therefore, I'd be the last person you'd expect to be totally enamored by a tofu salad. ?Yet hear I sit, 4 and a half hours later...thinking, no, fantasizing, about the amazing tofu salad that I had for dinner. Sprouts is definitely one of my new favorite restaurants. ?For a quick HEALTHY and relatively cheap meal, you can't go wrong. ?If you know your Palo Alto restaurants, think of Sprouts as a Pluto's meets The Counter. ? You basically go up and order your food, grab a number, and they bring it out to your table. ?You can either order a salad from the menu, or make your own. ?The choice of meats is great, too! ?(Hey, gotta get your protein!) ?I opted for the tofu tonight, but they have tri-tip and salmon for just a few extra dollars. ?I also remember seeing sauteed shiitake mushrooms too...(!!!) If, like my dad, you believe "salads are for rabbits", fear not. ?They have soup and sandwiches on their menu, and a great variety of appetizers. ?My friend and I ordered the pork* potstickers, and I thought they were pretty good. ?Not too greasy, not too heavy, and not too MUSHY! ?(I find that often, restaurants overcook their potstickers, that is, if they're not burnt.) I can't wait to go back! *Had you worried there, didn't I? ?Don't worry. ?I made sure to balance my veggie intake out with meat.

This place is INFINITELY better than Pluto's. I really despite plutos and I can't explain why. Maybe it's because people love Pluto's way more than they should, maybe it's because they are expensive and stingy on the meat, maybe it's because my meat is always charred, or maybe I just don't like the dressings. In any case, I like the look and feel of Sprout Cafe better. It's classy and clean and very well lit; they have some patio seating and the doors are open wide so you can get fresh air without having to sit on the sidewalk. I also like the presentation and variety of the toppings. The sandwiches were good, but on the small side for the price, but then again everything on University is pretty pricey anyway, right? I can't wait to come back and create another random salad concoction!

Very similar to plutos, but a little more upscale and more $$. ?They have salads to choose from or you can make your own. ?Sandwiches are available too for them salad haters out there. Me: Can I customize the pre-made salads on the menu? Cashier: No, they are already pre-made. ? Me: Oh, ok Cashier: But if you want to take something out and replace it, you can do that. Me: *confused why she said no* I got the fruit salad, but replaced the goat cheese with bleu cheese and got tri tip. ?The tri tip was chewy, cold, and well done (no options on how you want your meat cooked). ?Besides the meat, the salad was yummy!

Sprout is Pluto's meets the Counter plus -- enormous customized salads that you order with a checklist on a little clipboard. ?They also have signature salads, sandwiches, and soup. I had a half salad with spinach, a bunch of toppings (6 comes with price) including corn, kaiware, and buffalo mozzarella, a 'premium topping' for an extra $1. ? Small touch, but I also love the self serve cucumber water All in $6.83

Sprout is the same idea as Plutos down the street - for $7 or $8 bucks you get a customized salad with fresh yummy ingredients, however, I have to say that Plutos takes the cake.... Sprout is a little bit pricier, but they have more "gourmet" ingredients like avocado ?- yay for that! At Sprout you also get bread with your salad.. its ok. ?Kind of tough. One star for cleanliness, one star for humungo salads, and one star for having egg whites. Even though I prefer Plutos, that doesnt mean this place isn't good and that you shouldn't try it, I just don't like that its more expensive and their bread isnt as good.

Build-your-own-salad places are awesome. ?At Sprout, you just grab a clipboard and start ticking off boxes of all of the add-ins that you want. ?It's okay if salad's not your thing because there are sandwiches, soups, and the like as well. All of the ingredients used are very fresh and the customer service is friendly and quick (especially when you take your order to-go). ?I was expecting more substance to my salad, though. ?I didn't pay $10 for all of those add-ins to get 3 itty-bitty pieces of tofu and a couple of tablespoons of chickpeas. ?The bread is so good, but it doesn't make up for the lack of toppings.

I haven't been to Plutos but I think I'd like it more... While they have (some) great ingredients, they kind of skimped on them. ?I was excited they had quinoa but they really only sprinkled it on. ?I got some ahi tuna but it was pretty flavorless. ?My friend's shrimp sandwich was tastier, but not worth the price either. Overall, overrated.

I still love their salads. I like to get their signature creations, but if you are picky about your veggies, you can always go the "build your own salad" route. The salads are on the huge side, so for 2 people I'd suggest sharing a salad, getting a side or a soup (or 2 of them if you want =p). I really recommend trying some of their sides, they're great! One thing I'd like to comment on though, is that they usually have the same guy manning all the tables, bringing the food out to you and cleaning up. I just feel bad for that poor guy because he always seems so busy and also for the people waiting for their tables to be cleaned up. They really ought to just get another person... It's not like they don't have business, right? But if that bothers you, don't come here. You might get upset. They have a huge huge selection of bottled drinks too. I always like their iced teas or arnold palmers though :)

Yes, the salads were good, but they weren't as out of this world as I had been expecting based on all of the reviews. ? Don't get me wrong- everything was fresh and the Pomona salad I had was great! ?If you're looking for healthy alternatives, this is a good place to go on University Avenue. But one of the reviewers wrote a great review for this restaurant, and upon comparing Sprout Cafe with Berkeley's Cafe Intermezzo, declared Sprout Cafe to be far better. ?Are you kidding?!?! Berkeley's Cafe Intermezzo has fresh baked, delicious bread- the people here forgot to give us bread with our salad. ?Also, they were out of the mushroom veggie rolls when we ordered. ?Also, considering that they declared their Southwestern salad to be one of their most popular, I found it strangely lacking. ?I've had better salads. The other major bad thing about Sprout Cafe is that it is unnecessarily expensive. ?$24 for 2 salads?! So basically, good, pricey food, but not worth 5 starts. ?And I'm giving it 3 stars even because around 8 hours later after having one of their salads, my stomach didn't feel that great.

After a friend told me that the best salads she's had were from Sprouts, I decided to drop by to pick up some to-go since I was having lunch nearby. ? I came in around noon and there was already a long line of people holding baby sized clip boards picking off their ingredients for their custom salads. ?I decided to try a salad from their pre-fix menu. ?I got the Tofu Salad since I'm a big fan of Asian styled salads and I got my bf the Southwestern Salad - both for about 20 buckeroos. (And this didn't include chicken!) The salads...were a bit disappointing. ?It was A LOT of salad and NOT ENOUGH dressing. ?So the rest of the salad I picked on was dry although the soy dressing was delicious. ?I just wished I had another side or two of dressing to enjoy the rest of my salad. ?The crusted tofu was quite flavorful, too. ?I also thought the fried egg whites were yummy. ?My bf's salad was way too plain. ?There was SO MUCH romaine and SO LITTLE of everything else - it was definitely the plainest salad I've ever had. ?I think my biggest complaints is that the proportions were all off. ? If I ever do come back, I think I will just customize my own salad and get it in regular size so that there is enough dressing for my salad.

My 2 cents: "Go to Pluto's for your salad, go to Sprouts for everything else" Do NOT get a salad here! 2 friends of mine ordered salads and the lettuce was romaine and the toppings were sparse. Pluto's uses mixed greens and you get 7 toppings of your choice and meat for the same price of a sprouts mediocre salad with not much on it. **This is what I ordered: The squash soup (needed a lil salt but was excellent) and the shrimp spring rolls. Was perfect and 3 hours later I'm still feeling good.

Stumbled upon this spot while driving through Palo Alto. Loved the concept and it had a great vibe. My food was delicious and prepared extremely efficiently. Love the fact there were a few tables outside and while I stuffed my face I had a great people watching spot. ?Only thing that was a bit strange was when a homeless guy came by and asked if he could have a bite of my sandwich. I said no and he was very offended. I tried to explain that I do not even let my wife have bites of my food. But he did not appreciate the insight into my neurotic tendencies.

Solid salad place here. I love their variety of toppings and dressings. They will slice up some of the toppings fresh as they're making your salad!! Definitely more upscale and pricier than Pluto's down the street but they offer classier protein choices such as the tofu/seared ahi/poached salmon. Leafy mixes are also fresher here... and they offer baby lettuce AND arugula!! When I want a healthy salad topped with salmon and tofu, I come here. They also offer an awesome sauteed marinated shiitake mushroom topping here. The two times I tried their steak, it was dry flavorless and tough. Definitely prefer the steak over at Pluto's. When I want the hearty steak salad, I head over to Pluto's but any other time, Sprout does the trick!

I came here today for lunch with a few coworkers, and it was a very pleasurable experience. Sprout Cafe is located in the heart of downtown Palo Alto. It's a fairly well-sized restaurant--we were able to get a table even in the middle of the lunch hour, and there was a very short line to order food--only one person in front of us. The menu is very big. There are choice to design your own salad by filling out a form with what ingredients you would like in your salad. They've got traditional salad stuff to a little more ethnic stuff--like edimame and some sort of Japanese noodles. They also have pre-determined salads, soups, sandwiches, and little appetizers like spring rolls. I ordered a Southwest salad, and I must say... it was delicious. Black beans, corn, tortilla strips, avocado, cheese, and some kind of absolutely delicious dressing. It was so good. The only thing is I wish there was more avocado--I only found avocado in like two bites, which was a bit disappointing because I was specifically craving avocado and got the salad just because it had avocado. But none the less it was still yummy. I also ordered a lemonade and they gave me a strawberry lemonade, which is fine because it wound up being really good, with real little bits of strawberries in it. If you're craving a healthy meal, definitely try Sprout out. I approve!

Super fresh, tasty, and just wonderful in general. The grilled chicken was a delicious addition to the top of my salad and I was thrilled to discover that it was actually still warm. The balsamic dressing is AMAZING and they used just the right amount. -1 star for the insanely long line/wait for food. If you're that busy, hire some more people to make salads... seriously.

This place gets crazy busy for lunch but is chill for dinner. My favorite thing is the tofu appetizer. Seriously yummy.

I've been to Sprout several dozen times. ?The wait can be long at lunch (for dining there and for take-out), so order ahead and pick up for the fastest service. ?I love the food though. ?You can customize your salads with higher end ingredients than at Pluto's (like tofu, shiitake, quinoa), or just order one of their great salads and sandwiches on the menu. ?I almost always order their summer rolls as they somehow make this better than any Vietnamese restaurant i've been to - it's a combination of the skin being the real skins, not just made of rice flour, so they're just a little chewy and really translucent, the addition of the roasted shallots is perfect, and I prefer their tangy sauce over the peanut sauce you often get. In any case, everything here is extremely fresh and delicious. ?The only negative really is the wait.

This place should satisfy a group of people with wildly varying tastes. The picky eaters can build their own salads. If you're not feeling into the check boxes, you can choose a salad off the "menu" or even a soup or sandwich. Since this place is known for salads, I've been the subject of ridicule at my table for ordering a sandwich. The sandwiches take much longer than the salads to arrive, but they are so good it's worth the heckling of your friends. Before Sprout opened, I used to frequent Pluto's but I see no reason to go back there over Sprout.

Custom build your own salad with fresh, quality ingredients or try a soup or sandwich. ?Spacious, sleek modern decor. ?Great place to come for dinner after the gym or have a quick healthy dinner with friends. My friends had salads. ?I already had lettuce for the day so i decided to try other things. They ran out of Asian Chicken Noodle soup - i'll def try that next time. ?The organic corn chowder was good, very creamy and the ground nutmeg was nice. ?I tried the pork dumplings. ?I'd probably skip those next time.

After a handful of repeat visits, can't overstate my growing disappointment. ?Dude, the order form lists as explicitly as can be EVERY SINGLE ingredient, AND you still manage to eff it up? ?C'mon, it's basically color-by-number for salad makers--what's your major malfunction? ?And what is it with the schizo stingy-then-super-heavy-handed dressing? ?No likey.

This place has a great concept - fresh greens and all the different ingredients you could possibly want in a freshly tossed salad that you can create, or that they have concocted on their own. The food is delicious, and plentiful. Easy in, easy out. I ordered the grilled cheese, which was delicious - melty cheese and thin but grilled slices of bread, and I also ordered the corn chowder, which was hearty and full of pieces of potato, corn, and carrots. My friend ordered the papaya salad, which came out huge and looked fresh and tasty, and she also ordered the soup. Now, we got our food fast, it was good, and it was healthy. So why don't I give this place four or five stars? Because they have humongous salads and they give very little dressing if you ask for it on the side. I went and asked for another side of dressing for my friend and they charged me 55 cents for it. It was literally two more tablespoons of dressing in a plastic container. For 55 cents. REALLY? You're making a killing on greens, and you still want to charge for more salad dressing?? =( I do like the place, but the whole 55 cent transaction thing killed it.

I typically avoid healthy food. The only green food I usually consume is the occasional tequila-laced lime jello shot. After being forced to have lunch here, I changed my mind.

Tasty and creatively crafted sandwiches and salads with ingredients so fresh they could be from a secret behind-the-scenes garden - a distinct possibility since this *is* Palo Alto. ?Maybe it's really on the roof. I've eaten a variety of sandwiches and salads from here and only once was I disappointed, and I attribute that to the fact that I'm not a big fan of poached salmon. ?For reference, that was the Davy salad. ?The ingredients are good, but be certain you enjoy salmon because the taste is overwhelming. ?An alternative salad that includes fish and is one of my favorites, the Tuna Nicoise. ?A classic. Sandwiches to consider: ?The BLTA and The Shrimp. ?Always enjoyable. ?The Shrimp would be the winner for me, with its refreshing cucumber dressing and green onion bread. ?The shrimp is usually cooked just right, which seems like a difficult thing to pull off in a quick output sandwich shop like this. If you are into the traditional Croque Monsieur sandwich, the one at Sprout may disappoint. ?You aren't in Paris. ?Appears thin and barely better than a grilled cheese sandwich. ?Also no cheese or sauce fried around the outside of the bread as I normally imagine a Croque-M is supposed to have. If you don't like the pre-built salads (Signature) then they allow you to create your own with a nice little form. ?It is a bit like doing your taxes, but you only have to pay about $10-15 and you get a freaking awesome salad as your return! I want to say that prices are on the high side for a sandwich, but this isn't Subway. ?Plus, with each sandwich you also get a simple small green salad with vinaigrette dressing. ?Not a wilty faded-lettuce salad, but bold green and balsamic. After you order, I advise you toy run and find a seat (if available). ?Not only can it be crowded and seats be at a premium, but sometimes the salads are served so quickly they can beat you to a table! ?Seriously, last time we were there, my friend sat down and practically sat on the salad as it was being placed on the table! ?So, you can add fast service to the list of good qualities as well. If you're a macho dude, don't let the name keep you away. ?It's good eats, dude.

I've only been once, but I had an extremely fresh vegetarian sandwich here, and at a pretty decent price for Palo Alto. ?(Any lunch under 10$ is good fod Palo Alto, though Rangoon still has the best lunch special with a full meal hovering around $7) Recommend this place for vegetarians looking for a lunchtime cantina. ?It almost has a cantina feel, if only it had a few more communal tables it would be a great place to swap ideas.

I'm a pretty big fan of Salad Joints.. and this one seems great.. The menu is great and the salads are great. But like some of the low reviews I can see where their cleanliness can be an issue. The Salad's are HUGE so I could only eat some of it. When I went up to get my container to go I saw one of the workers cutting an apple w/ the sticker till on it. Hummm.... Do they not wash their fruits and vegetables? The next day when I decided to eat my salad for lunch I found that there was a lot of dirt on the leaks... Bites of dirt are not pleasant.

This is another one of those reviews where I wish Yelp had the half-star option! That said, Sprout Cafe is a 3.5 star kind of place, but I'm feeling generous today so decided to round up as opposed to down. For fellow SF folk who work on the Peninsula like myself, Sprout is basically the Palo Alto version of Mixt Greens. I've eaten here a few times, and the salads always have very fresh ingredients, delicious dressings and are quite filling in the end. The reason why I'm docking a half-star is purely because of the steak in my salad today. It was too tough and not very flavorful. I imagine they must be cooking the steak to appeal to the masses, so rarer meat is probably a no-go. But, that doesn't change the fact that I was a titch disappointed when I bit into the first slice of steak and I got a glimpse of what chewing on a rubbery dog toy must be like. But, that aside, I still very much enjoyed the rest of my salad and plan to continue to dine here. I'll just pass on the steak.

I can probably eat here everyday. ?I love salad. And what I love even more is protein in my salad with LIGHT dressing. ?You can have that at sprout. ?You can add seared tuna, tofu, beef, etc to any salad, and add more too! ?It's great. ?It's so tasty, fresh and filling. ? Parking always sucks. ?Seating can be tricky on busy days. ?I like the tofu salad, but I also like their seasonal harvest salad. ?Gosh, I think the first time I ate here, I went back two more times in the same week!

Cute cafe, with limited seating both indoors and out... nice atmosphere, with plenty of people watching. I came with a gf, and we tried the STEAKHOUSE SALAD, with the caesar dressing on the side. there was well done pieces of steak (I wonder if you can ask for medium rare?) with romaine, and bacon, and cripsy onion strips... tasty salad, even without the steak (As i'm eating vegetarian, so I gave the steak and bacon to my gf), and with the gorgonzola, it made for a yummy lunch! And they split the salad for you into two plates/bowls so it's less messy. and when you're DONE with your salad, they'll eventually come by with the next dish, which for us, was the PORTABELLO MUSHROOM PANINI... MMM tastey! This was as vegetarian as my gf was going to get, and she even felt that the sandwich didn't make her miss having protein. :) We both got to that "Good full" with the meal, and didn't quite polish off either plate. tasty lunch time, for 2 girls, for under $25 with 2 bevvies to boot. can't beat that!

One of my favorite places to eat, but the lines can be very long and they sometimes mess up your order when things get busy. ?The quality of the food is top notch and they have everything you could ever want on a salad. ?I often order a salad to go on their mobile app, but unfortunately the last two times I tried they did not receive my order so I had to wait when I got there. ?Also, they do not have a separate line for take out and eat in so it doesn't do you a lot of good to order ahead. ?Still, the food is so healthy and delicious I can't help but keep coming back.

bottom line: plutos reloaded let me start by saying i'm a really big fan of plutos. ?i didn't think i could find another place that had the same freshness and customizability as plutos, but lo and behold appeared sprouts on university ave. ?the interior seems a bit less playful than plutos, and is significantly brighter. ?you choose all your salad ingredients ahead of time, rather than barking out what you want as they make your salad; i kind of prefer doing it beforehand. ?my salad tasted great and portion sizes are huge. ?to be honest, this place isn't too different than plutos in my mind, though i'd say the meat is better at plutos, while the interior is more comfortable and prices are slightly higher at sprout cafe.

I enjoy the food here a lot. The salads are great and everything seems to be always fresh. Why it gets only 2 stars is for the customer service. Not to say that anyone has been rude but the wait time to get your food takes forever. The person at the counter is the same person who also answers the phone and serves your food if you are eating in. Calling ahead is your best bet however during busy times I have been on hold for over 5 minutes. All this place really needs is an extra person during busy times of day.

The curried chickpea & quinoa soup was quite possibly the best soup I've ever had. You have to pay for bread to go with it though. Other than that, it's a standard build-your-own salad cafeteria joint.

Really good salads, but take sooooooo long and is quite pricey. It's seriously ridiculous. Don't even try to go during a weekday lunch hour - you'll wait for over 30 minutes. Tuna nicoise salad is excellent (though costs as much as at a full-service restaurant)! I've never had a bad salad now that I think about it. Catering is really good too.

Love all the choices on what to put on your salad. ? Not so crazy about the quantity of food for the price, or that they left off one of my toppings. ?The fruit they used was also not that fresh, and fresh ingredients are pretty critical to making a good salad. Passion fruit citrus vinaigrette was possibly the best thing I have ever tasted. Overall, I would go back, but maybe just for the dressing.

Can we just say Ah-Ma-Zing! The food here is great! Everything is either organic or made fresh on site. Basic Procedure: 1) Grab a clip board with menu and a pencil 2) Check off your salad choices (type of lettuce, protein, veggies & dressing) 3) Pay 4) Wait for them to bring it to your table Be warned though, this is not just a simple pick-a-few-items and buy. Oh no no no, they have a multitude of toppings! I think I took almost 10 minutes trying to figure out what I wanted to put in my salad and even in line started adding more. Now if you're not good at making decisions they do have a handful of salads that they've decided what works best as well as sandwiches. One more warning, you'll want to add so many pieces of yummy goodness in your salad that it is VERY easy to spend $20! But then again it's $20 of yumminess so it's not too bad.

MMMMMMM. Sprouts Cafe..OM NOM NOM. This cafe will NOT disappoint! I came here with a friend during lunch hour (mistake #1) on a Tuesday. The line was to the door! Fortunately things move really quickly and their ordering process is straightforward. You can grab a clipboard and custom make their own salad or try to read their microscopic menu located far far away from the end of the line. Fortunately they also have to go menus next to the clipboard to assist the visually impaired and those who refuse to get glasses (like myself). It took about 20 minutes from the time we entered to get our salads. I ordered the Davy salad. MMMMMM. So fresh and a combination of all the best things in life! Avocado, seared salmon, corn shucked fresh off the cob, a delicious light dressing. There is also free cucumber water that pairs perfectly with salad. The portions are HUGE though. HUGE!!!!!!!!! Had I known this, I would have ordered a half salad. But even those are HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGEEE!!! Given that it's Downtown Palo Alto, the pricing is OKAY but can get steep really quickly. At an extra $ for each premium ingredient, customized salads can get expensive real quick. Their lemonade is also delicious but for some reason made me ridiculously thirsty. And the bathroom was kind of smelly. But I guess you can't have sprout with a little bit of p u.

I came in here for the Build Your Own large salad. ?I love how they provide a sheet with a long list of ingredients to choose from. ?The ingredients were fresh. ?The interior of the place is very well lit and seemingly clean. ? Ingredients: Choices of green veggies such as arugula lettuce and baby spinach, ingredients such as black beans, cherry tomatoes, firm tofu, red bell pepper, broccoli, edamame, raw sweet corns, and carrots, fruits that includes fresh sliced pears to dried cranberries, crumbled cheeses, and extras such as artisanal cheeses, candied walnuts, avocado, red beets, sun dried tomatoes and roasted red bell peppers. ?Poultry and Seafood ingredients are also available at extra cost. ? One of my favorites bottle drink Teas' Tea Green White is sold here. ?Excellent drink. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.

My friend ordered the shrimp sandwich. ?She said that it was the best shrimp sandwich she has ever tasted. ?It looked very simple but she said it was marinade/sauce/spices that made it so yummy. ?She wanted to know how they made it because she wanted to try it out.

This is a great place when you are craving a salad. My girlfriends and I come here when we want something light and healthy. I always custom build my own salads because I love the selection of fresh toppings from alfalfa sprouts to ahi tuna. The basil vinaigrette and soy ginger dressing are pretty tasty. They also offer half salads which is awesome since I can never finish a full order. I would give this place 4 stars if they didn't totally mess up my order the last 2 times. Romaine lettuce instead of mixed greens. Full order instead of a half order. Missing 2 ingredients. ?They were apologetic and quick to make it right again, but it really should not be that hard to toss in the right ingredients. I have yet to try the salads & sandwiches on the menu - will do so next time!

I am terrible at making trivial decisions (e.g. deciding what to have for dinner). ?However, I am surprisingly good at doing things well in an atmosphere of last minute panic. Cue my recap of Sprout cafиж; I went here with my sister/sister's roommate for dinner and was excited because I love salad, I love salads with lots of ingredients, and I like being IN CHARGE. ?Unfortunately, I was not prepared for the wealth of options Sprout provides. ?I was definitely "that girl" standing in line, fiddling with my pencil and trying to decide how to best delegate my six included salad toppings. ?Finally, after 5 prolonged minutes of deliberation, I checked off a few items that sounded good and turned in my card and paid. ?Only then did I see edamame next to the register and my sister's meal being made in front of me, and MAN did I have salad envy (my sister has been to Sprout more than once and is a bit of a DIY pro); I regretted not studying the menu for longer as I watched her begin to eat her salad and tried to remember what I had scribbled down. I shouldn't have worried; my salad was incredibly fresh and flavorful, with a great balance of flavors and ingredients (thank you, me) and the perfect amount of dressing (thank you, Sprout people). ?Their bacon was fantastically warm and crisp and the rest of my salad fixings seemed to be quite fresh as well. ?It made me feel confident that even if I hadn't enjoyed my flavor combo as much as I did, I still would have had a decent salad based simply on the quality of the ingredients. In the future, one might be wise to take a menu home and put it on the fridge for pre-Sprout planning (if you're type-A, like me), but you're likely to come up with a fantastic creation even if it's on the fly.

Solid salad place. Good service. Huge variety. I love coming to Sprout Cafe when I feel guilty about avoiding the gym. Nothing says "healthy" like a mountain of lettuce. You can build your own salad combo or order one of their signature salads, like tuna nicoise (I tried this one and it's my favorite). I love their selection of salad dressings. They don't soak your salad in dressing either, which is very nice. Just enough dressing to moisten the lettuce without drowning it. I'm giving this place three stars instead of four because of the inconsistency in quality. Don't get me wrong, the ingredients are generally great. But my last visit here, I had browning leaves of lettuce. Also, they got my friend's order wrong. It was quickly corrected, but I as there weren't a large amount of ingredients in her order, it should have been easy to get it right. Nevertheless, I know I will be back here many more times.

I never knew this place existed!!! My BF and I are on a low carb diet till our cruise to Mexico, so on a night out our friend suggested Sprouts for dinner since that would be well within out diet. ?And even if we weren't low-carbing it, I would be SO in love with this place because Salads are one of my favorite things to eat (no joke). ?The serving sizes are HUJANGOUS, so my BF and I shared one salad, which turned out to be the perfect size. ?They have so many pre-set salads to choose from if you don't want to make your own. ?We ordered the Rocky with Salmon instead of Chicken, and it was fantastic. ?My friends had the farmhouse salad and they liked it too. I really wish they had a place like this in DT mountain view, because I will be working there soon and its a lot closer to my house. ?I think it'd be a HUGE hit with the lunch time crowd (*cough cough wink wink* to the Sprout owners).

Cheap for Palo Alto, pricey for a salad. Some friends and I stopped at Sprout for a late lunch before hiking The Dish. ?I ordered a custom salad, a la Pluto's style, and my friends ordered ?the Orzo salad and Croque Monsieur sandwich. My salad was made with fresh ingredients, though I was dismayed to see that some ingredients, like roasted beets and roasted red peppers, are an additional $1 each! ?I added the furikakke tofu to my salad, which was deliciously crispy but otherwise tasteless. ?Sadly, there wasn't enough dressing left over from the tossing to season my tofu very well. I also had a bite of the orzo salad, which was great and leads me to think that if I do come back again I'll try one of Sprout's signature salads. ?I didn't get a taste of the Croque Monsieur, but it was on giant slices of white bread and looked sufficiently hammy and cheesy with a small spring salad on the side. The service also left a bit to be desired, even though it was well past the normal lunch hour. ?The manager was concerned that he may have lost one of our order tickets as it took a while for our meals to arrive, and when it did, our food came out staggered in 5-10 minute increments. ? All in all, an okay experience. ?I might try a pre-fab salad, but I'm more curious now about reevaluating Pluto's.

I'm a huge fan of Pluto's (down the street) and was fired up to try Sprout Cafe after a friend waxed eloquent about it. Final verdict: Thanks But No Thanks. I show up at 7pm on Saturday when the lines aren't long and I'm able to just walk up. The gal behind the register is friendly and I order the first salad on the menu, the "Somen" with somen noodles. But the while the register gal is cool, the salad maker is seriously incompetent. I mean, we're talking I-want-to-go-back-there-and-help-you incompetent. You're asked to fill out a little form checking off what you want; he stares at it like he's been given the nuclear codes and could set off World War III if he doesn't squint long enough at the darn thing. Once he's squinted to his heart's delight, he begins the laborious process of adding ingredients that are situated half a foot away. In the meanwhile, another gentleman at the far end of the bar slowly chops tomatoes and answers any questions our artisan friend may have. I ask myself - shouldn't this guy be building the salad? Eventually, he has to step in for the artisan because people are getting impatient. Lovely. The artisan is content to watch for a bit. I'm in a bit of a rush and see my salad FINALLY done as our slovenly friend chops the chicken breast and pops the lid on the to-go box. I ask him - I've by now mentally christened him Dubya - "is this for Saumil?" and he gives me the Soup Nazi look. "Hang on a minute!", he says. Then he proceeds to move the box of salad to the cash register (!) and reads the next set of nuclear codes. I grab the box and hit the road. I get home in a rush and open the box - oh wait. He forgot the somen noodles. IN THE SOMEN SALAD. So as I said, thanks but no thanks. I'll stick with Pluto's - their service is impeccable and the staff is friendly. Good luck to ya, Dubya.

I am not a fan of the wait.. today I went in to grab a salad as soon as they opened aprox. 11:10am and there was no line but seemed like everyone was calling in for pick up. I waited a good 20 min for my salad (the place was pretty empty). I thought that was rediculous! the ones sitting which there where 2 had already eaten and left by the time my one salad was made. The good thing about this place is that yes the salads are organic and they make them well. Was not to impressed by the Southwestern.. it seemed like they put a spoon full of ingredients and a bowl full of lettuce... very dissapointing. But today I had the kyoto salad and it was good for what it was priced with seared tuna and some other ingredients. I guess my advice for this place is to order a day before over the phone. Maybe try making your own salad instead of choosing a premade one.

Although I love the salads here (usually concocting my own mix of arugula, edamame, cherry tomatoes, avocado, etc), I absolutely have a weak spot for their sandwiches. The ingredients are fresh and the flavors innovative.

A great addition to the University Ave restaurant lineup. Reasonably priced gourmet chose your own topping salads. Sprout is a more polished upscale version of Pluto's. ?Also, more expensive with fewer toppings. ?(6.75 for a basic salad with 5 toppings) On the plus side there are about six lettuces to choose from including baby arugula, mache, butter lettuce, and red lettuce. ?There are also something like eight creative dressings to chose from. ? Sprout feels cleaner and more attentive than Pluto's. ?They also have significantly more vegetarian and vegan options including tofu and avocado. Places sprout could improve: serve larger quantities of toppings with the salad! ?I had trouble finding some of my toppings. ?(The amount of lettuce is great and the dressings are delicious.) ?I agree with the previous reviewers - for .80 I want to see my avocado! ? The fresh juice was okay - freshly made long before I ordered since it came out of the fridge, not exactly what I expected but tasted fine. ?It would be nice if the glasses were larger! ?I've had glasses at least twice as large at other restaurants for about the same price. ? Everything I've had here so far was tasty and fresh (try the chili lime dressing!) and I'll definitely be back - hopefully, by then the portions will have increased!

Bright and cheerful, you'll love the decor. It's a great place for a quick lunch. I went here with a friend for the first time last week, and the salad was excellent. It is Counter-style in the way you can select your base, toppings, and dressing. The selection was very surprising, not the usual fare that you find at Plutos. I got mine with seared ahi tuna, sliced pears, sweet corn, cherry tomatos, and crunchy wonton strips. :) Watch out though, the salads are large! Get a mini if you don't have a big appetite. A regular will leave you with plenty of leftovers.

I decided to try this place after reading the good reviews on yelp. I was not disappointed. I was a bit overwhelmed when I attempted to make my own salad. So many options, what would go good together? After about 15 minutes of me standing there over analyzing my ingredient choices, I decided to ditch the build it yourself salad for a salad on the menu. So glad that I did. I chose the Fruity salad. It was delicious! It came with pomegranates, strawberries, apples and a few other types of fruit. Such a good blend. I was practically licking my tray when I was done with it. My friend had the Caesar salad and wasn't a fan, but I sure was happy with my choice! The only downside of my experience here was that we got there 15 minutes before closing time and had to find a different location to actually eat the salads.

I first discovered Sprout's 10 days ago. Instead of hastily jumping to write a review after my first salad here which I SO loved, I decided to do this in a scientific manner and collect more samples. I am in Sprouts as I write this :-) Method: I have come here 7 times in the last 10 days. Each time, I order the Somen Noodle salad with the deliberate addition of "light on the noodles, dressing on the side, add firm tofu please". A few times I have dared to deviate from the experience by adding the squash soup. Results and Discussion: The pros first -- delicious dressing. Great texture from the intermingling of the tortilla strips, with the peanuts, the lettuce and the soft noodles. ?Great recipe. The cons -- My salad has been very inconsistent. One time I got what looked like a noodle dish rather than the salad. Thereafter, I started stressing "light on the noodle". That almost fixed it except sometimes now they add TOO many tortilla strips! This makes me want to say "light on the tortilla strips" but this means my salad keeps shrinking in size. I tried saying "heavy on the leaves" but that didn't go very far! I can get used to the might expensive bill but the inconsistency causes me huge anxiety every time I order. If I am paying 10 bucks, I want the same perfect salad every time. It was love at first sight but my love is souring with time. I hope things get fixed soon or breaking up will be painful!

Sprout has the best salads I've had in a long time. ?Although I'll never be the mayor on foursquare, http://playfoursquare.coбн, (can't go THAT often) I go at least once a week. My favorite menu item is a slightly modified Rocky Salad: ROCKY $8.95 herb grilled chicken breast, baby spinach, baby arugula, apples, egg, grapes, cherry tomatoes, roasted red bell peppers, gorgonzola, fried onions, ranch dressing I love that you can create your own salad because they have an amazing list of ingredients. ?And while I don't usually pay $9 or $10 for lunch, it's worth it once and a while for a delicious salad. ?You definitely get what you pay for. Oh, and I recommend calling in your order because it can get pretty busy during the lunch rush.

This is sort of like an upscale version of Pluto's...staff bring the food to you once you order as opposed to paying on the spot at Pluto's..decor has a nicer cleaner feel --so why the 3 star rating??? I went with a "make your own salad" with tri-tip...the tri-tip was a bit cold and tougher to chew for some reason...I may have given this place a higher rating but in comparison to Pluto's meat, it was average at best --they do have very good fresh ingredients, so i'll give them that..one other small aspect that bothered me was that they basically forgot about my g/f's order. My order came first..1/2 way through my meal, my g/f was still waiting for her meal...we had to finally ask what the hell was up and then immediately after they gave her her meal..sorta defeats the purpose of eating together when I was already done with my meal --I will give this place another shot in the future..it may have been an isolated case based on the # of other favorable reviews..however, i'd still pick Pluto's over this place

If you like salads, this is your place. They have many special salads but you can also customize your own, which I did. Options are endless. I was not disappointed as all the ingredients were super fresh, and since I chose every single ingredient, my salad was wonderful. Glad I chose the full order because there was a ittle bit leftover...definitely can be a hearty meal if you choose the full order option. The one thing they forgot was to give bread. I was going to go back to the counter and ask for bread but felt as if this was a petty issue because....well...it's just bread. I like both Pluto's and Sprout Cafe. Sprout Cafe is a bit pricier but they may have more salad ingredients.

Want a salad to go? Beat the sorority girl lunch rush by phoning your order in! Sprout will have your salad ready to go by the time you get over there to pick it up. This is totally convenient and time-saving.

I absolutely LOVE this place!! ?Yeah yeah yeah, salad is a salad is a salad... or rabbit food for some but it's so tasty that you don't really think of it as healthy food. ?I've never actually had their signature salads or sandwiches because I always have so much fun making my own salad! ?I try a new combination every time I go. ?They have really good soups too so if you feel like you need something more filling, add a soup! A few must tries to eventually get into your salad one way or another (obviously not all at the same time! :p) : passion fruit dressing, chili lime vinaigrette and sauteed shiitake mushrooms!

This place should be categorized as salads, not sandwiches. Salad is the primary item for sale here. Sprout Cafe is a lot like its older competitor down the street, Pluto's. Sprout, however, is a much nicer place to sit for a meal because it is quieter. Pluto's is not only more crowded, but it's walls must not absorb sound or something. Anyway, from what I can tell the food is pretty similar--perhaps slightly more expensive--but Sprout is more pleasant. If you're on a budget, you can get a great half salad (which is plenty for one medium-sized person) with $5-7.

Love this place and that you can get a made-to-order salad in a matter of minutes (as long as you're not here during the lunch hour). The lettuce wraps are also amazing -- order them! Their one fall from grace is that nearly every time I've been here, they've missed an ingredient or two from my (or a friend's) salad. Not a big deal since you get to choose quite a few, but can be disappointing.

Sprout = Fresh and Tasty. I cannot remember a time when I had a fresher salad in my life. Typically I'm not a salad kind of guy, but after experiencing Sprout Cafиж I have a better appreciation on how great a fresh salad can taste and make you feel afterward. First off the decor of Sprouts is very modern, very open and bright which goes perfect with the food. Everything is fresh and bright looking, as if it was plucked from the earth that day. And they give you very generous portions. In addition to the regular menu, they also have a clipboard in the front where you can build your own salads to your particular tastes. The two items I travel from Berkeley to Palo Alto to have is the Davy Salad. Which is: poached Scottish loch duart salmon, baby arugula, avocado, sweet corn, aged sharp white cheddar, candied walnuts, shaved fennel, red onions, sesame ginger dressing; SO GOOD! With that many ingredients who would think it would be so good and tasty? As an alternate I sometimes go with the Tuna Nicoise salad: pepper crusted seared ahi tuna, butter lettuce, green beans, roasted potatoes, kalamata olives, egg, cherry tomatoes, herbs, lemon tarragon vinaigrette. There Ahi Tuna is nicely seared and very tasty and I sometimes forget to eat the lettuce and the greens. Healthy should always taste this good. One note: it gets extremely crowded @ lunch, expect at least a 45 minute wait if you don't go before 12 Noon.

Made to order salads and sandwiches with fresh, creative ingredients while you wait. ? If it's your first visit go for one of their salads or summer rolls rather than trying to "make your own". ? I've been here dozens of times, but I've always ordered "to go". ?During peak times, it's hard to find a table. The best "deal" is any catering sized salad - you can feed 6 - 8 for $25, perfect for an office luncheon. ?When I have a large dinner party, I swing by here and order the catering size salad, put it in my crystal bowl at home and have one less thing to worry about ?: ?) My fav is the Pomona salad with roasted brussel sprouts, fennel, quinoa, and fresh baby spinach. ?So fresh and good! ? The Steak house salad has big chucks of Tri-tip and quartered roasted potatoes - It's a hearty salad - enough to fill the biggest of appetites. I don't know what all the strange veggies are in the Kyoto salad, seaweeds? ?But mixed all together its a plethora of outrageous flavors and textures even without any dressing. No one has to tell me how healthy it is. ?I can feel myself getting stronger with every bite.

Best salad in town and quite possibly the world. i was very hesitant at first as it's just a salad. I was wrong to ever doubt it. Contents are always fresh and depending on when you go, the wait time is reasonable. Avoid Lunch hour. Ahi Tuna and avocado are my favorite adds to the salad.

Uber fresh, fast, and fun. Gourmet greens, fruit, and an awesome assortment of veggies like beets, and yummy dressings! I had balsamic vinaigrette, and it was super. Highly recommended.

We all know that annoying picky chick at a meal: the one who asks a billion questions about the preparation of her food, then aggressively substitutes enough items such that the new dish is bastardized beyond recognition, irritating the chef, the waiter, her dining mates, and herself... :( Well I am That Girl, and Sprout Cafe is my savior, the true panacea for the persnickety. In this safe haven of bountiful goodness, it's not only accepted for you to have things just they way you like them: it's expected. In lieu of a hostess you are greeted at the door by a table of clipboards, on which lie an impossibly comprehensive list of salad ingredients for you to check off to your hearts content: 7 types of lettuce, every vegetable, fruit, seed, and cheese you can think of, plus gourmet protein options and over 20 kinds of dressing (you indicate how heavily dressed you would like it). I highly recommend the butter lettuce, roasted summer vegetables, and poached salmon or seared Ahi tuna as key components, but really the beauty of it is that it's totally up to you. Also, the butternut squash soup is light, perfectly sweet, and the perfect counterpart to a crisp, fresh, mountainous salad. ?Picky eaters need not be ashamed any longer!

sprout vs. pluto's. ?well, a salad is a salad right. ?no tuna today, so got a custom salad with salmon (was on the sweet side). ?pluto's sometimes mixes stuff well and tastes great, othertimes made too much in a hurry. ?many options here so lots of choices (or the pre-selected ones to help you decide. ?lettuce was good, the mango pieces were macerated, toasted pumpkin seeds good, wish I had more of the little stuff like grapes and cherry tomatoes. ?best part is feeling like eating healthy, esp. since i added the fresh herbs. ?sesame ginger sauce -- lots of options here for ingredients that would take you awhile to try all the combos.

Ate their a couple weeks ago for the first time. Went by and Yelped the place and ate there the next time we were in PA. Essentially it is a Pluto's knockoff in concept, but I thought the facilities were more spacious and less crowded. The service was better too when we went. People actually went table to table to refill water. Kudos. We both had the tri-tip sandwiches--very yummy. The fried calamari would have been better with an aoli sauce and with a few more dead squid. The salads looked generous but higher-priced than Plutos. Too bad they didn't have two sizes like their competition. It is on the less busy end of University, so hopefully they can get some foot traffic. Verdict: worth trying again so hopefully Sprout sprouts in PA.

Decent food, fresh and crisp. ?My nicoise tuna salad was very tasty; sharp, well balanced textures and flavors. ?The tri tip steak was overcooked in the sandwich my husband had. ?Very nice breads. Nice decor and layout. They offer made-to-order salads similar to the routine at Counter Burger. But they premade salad and sandwich options looked delish. Limiting my score is the service. ?They are clearly understaffed, although friendly. Tables that were seemingly empty for a while had not been serviced. Those that were had dirty tables. (We cleaned off our own because we were sure it would be quicker than waiting for the staff). ? Might come back, but probably not.

I would never think to put corn (and crispy potatoes for that matter) in a sandwich, but it totally works! ?I l-o-v-e-d the tri-tip steak sandwich. ?I needed to add a dash of salt on the meat for my taste, and yes, the roof of my mouth was a bit raw afterwards (remember the feeling after captain crunch?), but it was totally worth it. I read that the owner is the son of the owners of Windy's (which I remember liking) and a graduate of culinary school. ?I know everyone is into the make-your-own salad deal, but next time I'm trying another one of this guy's creations. ?I trust he knows his combinations.

Rockin' salads. Of course, that's because I decide what goes in it, hehe. Sprouts simply provides fresh ingredients (and consistently so)--for example, some of the best applewood smoked bacon I've ever come across. You get a choice of greens; a huge variety of extra ingredients including seeds, nuts, fruits, cheese, meats, and more; and about 20 dressings. You also get to choose how the dressing comes: tossed, light, on the side, etc. For those who prefer heartier salads, I recommend going for the half salad as opposed to the full. You get less greens but the same amount of ingredients (that is, the extra 1 buck 70 is purely for greens). On another note, they also have wifi, some large tables, and a few highly sought-after outlets. Decor is contemporary with high ceilings.

This is the salad version of 'The Counter' burger place ! When you enter, there is a console table that greets you with the mini clipboards with the customize your own salad order sheets. I tried this place for a light dinner. They have a great selection of different kinds of salads to choose from! We ordered the Kyoto Salad and I was in the mood for a sandwich, we also ordered Croque Monsieur and an Arnold Palmer to wash it all down. The Kyoto Salad: Very nice salad with an abundance of seaweed that really flavored the salad nicely. The seared Ahi Tuna was cooked just right and the edaname was a nice touch to round all the flavors together. We ordered the miso dressing on the side to avoid the soggy salad. This salad would be good with little or even no dressing, great if you are trying to watch the waistline. The salad just needed a bit more somen noodle, otherwise it was perfect. The Croque Monsieur- Meh.Nothing special. I could have just made this at home. I have had better at other places. The arnold palmer- Nice balance of tea and lemonade This is a great place to go if you want to eat good, fresh and healthy food with out temptations of other items on the menu that will or could sabotage your diet!

Love the fresh salad bar and option to create your own. However, it can get pretty pricey if you don't want much of the "free' options. This is why I prefer to make my own, but if I didn't bring my own lunch this is a great substitute. Love: thai vinaigrette, pulled pork sandwich, organic butternut squash soup, summer rolls with chicken or shrimp, and grilled cheese. Not a fan: chipotle sandwich. The staff is very friendly. It does get really busy during lunch but that's to be expected.

This place is my all time favorite to pick up a salad. ?After hearing a coworker rant and rave about Spout Cafe, a few of my other coworkers and I decided to try it. ?The salads here are absolutely amazing and we have been coming here quite often. You can choose a salad ?listed on the menu or you can be creative and create your own. ?I haven't tried one from the menu yet, as I always tend to create my own. There are multiple ingredients to choose from and they are always fresh. ?You get to choose a green, six standard ingredients, and can add optional premium ingredients/ meat for an additional $1 - $4. ?There are also many dressings to choose from, but I always get the low fat miso dressing, which I absolutely love. ?I have also gotten the corn chowder a few times and that was pretty tasty too. The only con about this place is that it can get crowded during lunch hours. ?This however, still does not stop me from coming here.

Even if you're not a big fan of tofu, definitely give their furikake crusted tofu salad topping a chance. It's fried just enough to balance the healthy-ness of it, and makes it a real treat in each bite! The make-it-yourself salads can be overwhelming and you can easily go wrong on mixing ingredients that don't go well together, so I stick to the signature seasonal salads which are always great. Like the other reviews have said, Sprouts is a fancier more restaurant like version of Pluto's. Pluto's doesn't have any signature salads, and so you have to choose all your ingredients. It's a little pricey, but not compared to everything else on University if you want fresh, tasty, and healthy. During the lunch hour it can get pretty packed, and there's been a few times where they've forgotten or messed up my order, so don't feel bad about going up and asking about your order. I really hope that more restaurants like Sprouts will pop up in other downtown areas like Mountain View!

We USED to go here all the time until we got fed up with the appalling service.

I loved Sprouts because their ingredients are fresh and high quality. However, last time I went, my jaw dropped when I noticed there was mud on the lettuce. There were big pockets of mud on the lettuce, as if it had not been washed properly. I told the cooks on the counter and they made me another salad. I was so disgusted I had eaten lettuce with mud that I could not enjoy the salad at all. I'm sad because I really enjoyed their salads. However I'm going back to Plutos for a while.

The food was okay (actually it was pretty tasty), however the service was horrible. First off, as we waiting at our table, the 3 people at the table next to us all had received the wrong orders. All of them. After that I was bracing for what I knew was about to happen...and yes it did happen. My tri-tip steak salad was suspiciously light on steak (meaning there was none). Oh and what about those cucumbers I ordered in my salad? Sir, it says here I am to get bread with my order, where is my bread? I asked the server to please address these issues and he came back with about 4 measly pieces of steak....what about my bread? Oh, they ran out. How long have they been in business? Probably not much longer. This place was a disaster. My first and last time going here. Why risk it? Go to Plutos a couple of blocks down and you know you will get what you ordered. On a side note, the half salad was about half the size of pluto's half salad....so more like a quarter salad.

This is a nice, inenxpensive, newly remodeled cafe. I've been here four times already. ?Each time the salads were excellent, and I'm not really a salad person. The thing that struck me was that the ingredients were very, very fresh, noticeably fresher than other salad places I've been in. ?I took my sister from NYC here, and she has been a vegan for most of her life. She raved about her salad, the dressing and the bread on the side. Since I'm a foodie, non-vegan, I didn't understand what she was saying, but apparently she really liked it. ?I had the Chicken Caesar the lettuce was very fresh and crisp, and the Chicken was a grilled breast, and it was tender and tasty. One complaint I sort of have is with the complicated menu. I suppose if you want choices over all the ingredients that make up a salad, great. ?I skip the menu and just order a Chicken Caesar ?because it's soooo good.

Surprisingly slow service. ?Was in there around 7:30p on a Thursday, and it took a full 20-minutes to make two simple sandwiches. ?They were understaffed, and unapologetic. Sandwich was decent, but nothing to write home about as the bread was on the dry side. The greens were fresh and tasty, but they hardly constituted a "side salad". ?For a $9 sandwich, I'd expect more as it was a simple mix of spinach leaves and a few other seemingly random leaves. The place is trendy, but is likely to suffer when the Facebook crowd moves out as it seems popular with that group.

Upon walking into Sprout Cafиж, you find yourself bombarded with options: Pick a green, pick 6 toppings, choose an optional protein, decide if you want premium ingredients (go for the shaved parmesan!), opt for a particular dressing...the list goes on!

Do I love salads? Yes. Do I love salads with massive amounts of bacon on it? HELL YES. So here's the deal, this place works exactly like Plutos where you can customize your own salads. ?Grab a clipboard with the listed ingredients and start checking off what you want. ?This is my formula: 1. full salad 2. 1/2 baby spinach, 1/2 romaine 3. add corn, mango slices, crispy fried onion, cucumbers, jicama, gorgonzola, sprouts, and depending on the freshness cherry tomatoes. 4. premium ingredients: applewood bacon, lots of it! 5. 1/2 dressing mixed in, 1/2 on the side. 6. dressing type: i usually get mango passion fruit but i heard the soy sesame is pretty delicious too. Voila! Most amazing salad EVER! ?Also, I recently tried the grilled ham and cheese sammish and loved it. ?However, please beware for all you anti-salt lovers out there. ?It gets pretty intense with all that cheese and seasoned meat.

Consistently the best salad I've ever had! Minor complaints: - I've told too many people how awesome Sprout is, so now there are often long lines at lunch time. - Chefs sometime forget ingredients, but always fix it right away when I mention the oversight. Current favorite custom salad: - full salad - mixed greens - anchovies - cherry tomatoes - egg - dried currants - crumbled gorgonzola - crumbled feta - avocado - pepper crusted seared ahi tuna - dressing mixed in - balsamic vinaigrette - cost: $13 (well worth it considering high quality ingredients and location) Try switching out currants for strawberries when they're in season!

I tried this place multiple times. On my first time, I was very skeptical of its taste believing... "I don't need someone else to make my salad. How could it be better?" However, I was very wrong and very impressed at its quality. I won't go too much into story mode, so I'll just summarize this place. Food: This place has very good choices for ingredients. If building your salad is too overwhelming, their suggested custom salads are great. Their salads do not mask the natural flavor of its ingredients with dressing, but you are welcome to request more dressing. The quantity of everything seems just right and includes bread. :-) (Not like Mixt Green) Service: The service is very streamline. It is like Pluto's. You scribble your ingredients on a menu then hand the paper to the cashier. If you choose "to eat here", a server will drop off your dish at your table. I guess I would label this as gourmet fast food. :) You order yourself, but a server will clean up your table and drop off your food. Overall, I like this place. Yes, I agree that it is a little pricey, but the taste is worth it. I tried Mixt Green, but found that Sprout was better. I need to try Blue Barn Gourmet, so I would have a better base.

Yelp is definitely IMO, geared to younger whipper snappers. I always check reviewers to see whether they are like minded to my interests. I am a baby boomer - on the "younger" end mind you. ;-) So perhaps I have a different mindset than from what I've read here on Yelp. So: Sprout. It's good, it's okay. Can't say I'd drive out of my way to order a meal here, but if I had think of a vegetarian place to pick because I'm in the area, well then, Sprout would come up on my list. Of the items ordered, the sesame tofu was quite tasty. What did I have? A "BLTA". It was good but not extraordinary. I'd try something different next time around. We also had veggie egg rolls. They were okay, nothing to chortle home about. My friend had the grilled cheese & she said it was "okay". She was the die hard vegetarian. So overall, these folks are "okay" & I'd likely check them out again if I'm in the area.

I am a huge fan of Sprout. ?Best place in my opinion to grab a quality lunch whether it be a sandwich or salad. ?EVerything is really fresh and amazing. ?Dont bother with Plutos, this is the place to be. ? But be warned, the lines get really long and they are definitely on the slower side of service.

I love this place. The salads are incredible - my favorites are the Somen Noodle (with furikake tofu), Tuscan, and Farmhouse. The serving sizes are very generous and very satisfying, not leaving you the least bit hungry after having "just a salad" for a meal. I love the whole concept of the restaurant, and I think the owner is a genius. Everything is fresh, tasty, and healthy, and I love the plethora of salad ingredients available on a daily basis (in case you want to build your own). They also provide cucumber water, which is a great detail. Though I always end up getting salads whenever I go here, the sandwiches are good, as is the guacamole offered on the Small Bites menu. The guacamole is chunky and the slightest bit spicy, which you can feel a few seconds after having a bite. It's just enough for you to notice it and keep you wanting more. It's my favorite non-salad item to order. Keep in mind, the salads come out much faster than the menu items that must be prepared in the kitchen (all non-salad items). If you're hungry, this could be annoying. But be patient, and you will see why it's worth the wait.

One word to describe my relationship with Sprout: obsession. ?Plutos used to be my favorite place to eat downtown, and Sprout has quickly replaced it. ?Really good customizable, "build your own" salads with tons and tons of variety. ?It's a little pricey for a college student, but it's definitely worth it. ?Haven't tried the sandwiches or soups there, but I'm sure they're good. ? One complaint: I got steak on my salad once and it was a little dry. ?Now I just choose to have a vegetarian salad instead.

Sprout Cafe is my favorite salad place, of all time, anywhere. There is an amazing variety of possible salad toppings that you won't find at places like Fresh Choice, Sweet Tomatoes, or Souplantation (i.e. papaya and somen noodles). Everything is perfectly fresh and perfectly ripe. Each salad is a veritable mountain of tasty little morsels. My favorite "signature" salad on the menu is the "Harvest," which has butter lettuce, apples, roasted brussel sprouts, roasted butternut squash, sweet corn, roasted red bell peppers, roasted potatoes, dried cranberries, and toasted pumpkin seeds. I also like the "Farmhouse" and the "Somen." As an additional nice touch, the restaurant offers courtesy cucumber infused water in addition to regular water. As previous reviewers have mentioned, Sprout Cafe can get crowded during the weekday downtown lunch rush, which is a drawback. At most other times,there are plenty of tables. One glance through the front window will tell you all you need to know about the crowd. If there's a line and you don't wait to wait, there's always Loving Hut across the street.

Spacious interior, high ceiling, brick wall accents, comfortable cushions. full of stanford students, professors and all-walks in between. gals show up in tights, guys show up in shorts and sneakers. Wait, do they just "dress" that way for sprouts cafe? Salad order form on clip pads. great portions, humongous variety. honey chipotle dressing will make you want to lick your fingers. i always get the ahi tuna and egg whites added. try jicama with mixed greens. did I mention cucumber water - no this is not a beverage - their water jug has cucumbers in it. Its a great lunch place, a little $$ though. But I'm a salad junkie and this works for me cos I am WORTH IT. :p

This place is awesome. ? Great salads (though if you make your own, you'll quickly find yourself going over-board with enough toppings to make a two salads) They also have a small sandwich selection. Wish that they had a better rotating selection of soups. ?The Asian chicken noodle is great, but we go about once a week, and a little variety wouldn't hurt... Also bummed that they're closed on Sunday evenings. ?I can't tell you how many times we've wanted to go to Sprout for dinner on a Sunday night.

They make a nice salad. I'd go here a lot more often if their line & order handling weren't a complete mess. Everyone waiting for a salad is crowded in a tiny space between the line & a wall, and there's usually a confused looking guy behind the counter with a stack of 10 salad boxes looking at a bunch of mixed-up receipts as if they're written in French. Four stars for "making a pretty good salad", one star for "hand the salad to the right person in a halfway sane and timely manner".

Sprout might have been good at one point, but the service sucks now: Last 3 orders for an office: 1. ?Gave order of about 4 salads a other things. ?I was told that the order would be ready in 10-15 minutes so I get there at the 15 minute mark... Can you say waiting around for another 25 minutes and the counter staff not even saying sorry. ?Besides that, they got 1 salad wrong and gave us the wrong soup. ? 2. ?Called to order and put on hold. ?5 minutes later not a peep from them so time to go someplace else. 3. ?Somebody else ordered at the office so I decided to join in. ?7 Salads and 3 of them were wrong (including mine). ?But she only had to wait around for 10 minutes! So I am boycotting Sprout, since for an $8-$10 salad, you should think they could at least get it right.

Oh Sprout, how I love thee. This place is knighted by my friends as the "over priced salad place", yet I still remain a loyal customer. Love the tofu salad - furikake crusted tofu with edamame, bean sprouts, spring salad, bell peppers with a ginger soy dressing. Delicious! Also dig the seared tuna salad too. Each salad comes with a slice of yummy bread. If I can't get Tender Greens to open up shop in nor cal, this place will do the trick for now. Oh, and there is free wifi for your working lunch/dinner meetings, blah blah blah. Or to look busy with your laptop while dining alone. Sniff.

Sprout is great for a light, healthy meal. Fast service, with lots of menu options other than salads. (They have some dim sum appetizers, cold/hot sandwiches, and soups.) As far as the salads, there is a list of them on the menu or you can make one to order. I'd say this place is good for picky eaters. I recommend the Davy salad with butternut squash.

I have been to Sprout three times and have ordered salad every time.A note on attire: during lunch hour the store seems to be dominated by business-woman. Everyone seems to be wearing slacks and pumps, or maybe nice jeans and a blazer. Lets start at five stars: The employees know their salad. They are skilled and efficient at mixing up all the ingredients and as the ingredients are fresh and good quality this makes for a good salad. One star less for the wait: You enter and fill our your card, with virtually no line at the checkout you are excited about the quick service that you will receive due to the lack of line and efficient salad-men. WRONG. Those salads they are mixing are not yours, they are the salads of the 8 costumers ahead of you who are sitting at the table, and they are the take-out lunch for some lucky business-casual workers at a firm down the street. The wait is long. One star less for the steak: After becoming an avid steak-eater and one who understands how simple it really is to pan fry a good quality rib-eye to perfection, I am highly critical of the tri-tip with which they will top your salad if you desire some steak. The steak is overdone and dry. So I give Sprout three stars. While the ingredients are fresh and of a high quality, the wait seems unfairly long and the steak is not so great. I wouldn't complain, but maybe next time around I'll come with plenty of time and my own meat.

Here at Sprout Cafe you can order one of the 16 or so pre-made salads, or if you want to do the wild thing there is a make your own page with everything on it. You do the math, there are over 100 options, so the number of combinations approaches the infinite. Veggie sandwiches? Try the traditional grilled cheese or the eggplant sandwich. I have had the eggplant, and it is quite tasty. Or go for the meats with BLT (5 of ?5), Turkey club (5 of 5), or Steak (4 of 5).

Sprout salads are awesome. They remind me a lot of Intermezzo in Berkeley. I usually go with the Rocky (chicken, spinach, arugala, etc) or the Steakhouse (tri-tip, romaine, bacon, etc) salad. It's crazy busy at lunch, so I usually just phone my order in and pickup 15mins later.

i'm so not down with these supposedly "high quality" places ripping you off for mediocre food. here's the custom built salad i ordered by checking boxes on the paper checklist that you give to the salad makers: full salad of mixed greens with broccoli + firm tofu + quinoa + apples + red onions + avocado (+$1.00) + roasted brussels sprouts (+$1.00) + herb roasted potatoes (+$1.00) + seared ahi tuna (+$3.95) i was NOT happy with my $14 salad (RIP OFF)...for many reasons. 1) they LEFT OUT THREE of my chosen ingredients - the apples, tofu, and herb roasted potatoes...which happened to be the ingredients that i wanted the most. WTF. i could probably understand if they left one out on accident...but they left out THREE, when the checklist is right in front of them as they are building the salad. that's just...dumb. 2) you are given three small wedges of herb roasted potatoes the size of steak fries, for an extra $1.00. i know because i went back and asked for what i paid for. come on now...potatoes are cheap. are you THAT STINGY to only give people three small wedges for an extra $1.00? 3) they skimp like crazy. the full salad here is like a half salad at pluto's. i'm still annoyed that for an extra $2.00 i got three withered roasted brussels sprouts, and a couple of chunks of avocado. but for some reason they unnecessarily LOAD the salad up with red onion. the red onion is cut in thick rings, and was sooo overpowering throughout the entire salad. 4) the seared ahi tuna is chewy and tough. GROSS. 5) the piece of bread that comes with the salad is half a slice of bland brown bread. compare this lame bread with the hefty focaccia slice from pluto's. MAYBE i'd come back to give the pulled pork sandwich or other sandwiches a try, but as for these awful salads, PASS. way overpriced for what you get, quality is not good, and the workers need to not be so SLOPPY. i'd rather go to pluto's down the street and have a huge, ?delicious salad for $6.50.

Sprout is like the lovechild of Pluto's and The Counter, inheriting custom salads from the former and handy checklist menus from the latter. I vastly prefer the choice of lettuce here, but something about Pluto's cohesive whole just makes me happy, and I left Sprout not quite satiated. What I did like: the aforementioned lettuce, and the delicious premium toppings--it's all about bacon, avocado, and buffalo mozzarella in my book. What I didn't like: the proportion of lettuce to other stuff was overwhelming--I found myself digging through mounds of lettuce in search of more avocado, or almonds, or cheese. Also, and most importantly, the price. Those premium ingredients add up at $1 apiece, but you can't NOT have them. Quite the conundrum.

The greens and proteins appease my carbaphobe hubby and the kids love the chicken noodle soup, pot stickers, and shrimp spring rolls. The staff is very accommodating with our kids and the salads are so fresh and yummy. The takeout salad orders are always packaged carefully in big rectangular boxes so we don't have to worry about salad spillage when we toss them at home.

yum! sprout : palo alto :: mixt greens : sf. i know what you're thinking, salad = yawn. seriously, though, sprout is really excellent. the quality of the ingredients is great and they have some amazing ideas on the menu as well as design-your-own salads. they even have mini clipboards where you check off the ingredients you want. sample ingredients include things like quinoa and sundried tomatoes. i actually went 2 days in a row because this place is so awesome! yesterday, i ordered a custom salad with steak which was excellent. my boyfriend had the nicoise, with fresh seared ahi. we also got some of the potstickers, which were yummy but probably not as healthy as the salad :) the salads are dressed perfectly and the flavors have been fantastic in everything i've tasted. today i got the tuscan, which has spinach, orzo pasta, feta, olives, and grapes, to name a few ingredients. i'm so happy i discovered this place!

I'm writing this review as I'm eating my take-out salad at my desk. ?I only give it 3 stars for these reasons: 1. ?I chose baby arugula as my salad base. ?Some of the leaves are bruised and have yellowish spots on them. ?Tasted fresh though. ? 2. ?I accidentally picked only 4 basic ingredients in Step #2 of this "build your own salad" process, out of 5 offered. ?No one alerted me (maybe the cashier could have since she entered my order in her computer). ?I feel jipped. ?Still, I admit, it is my fault. 3. ?The chili lime vinaigrette dressing I chose was not tossed with my salad. ?I assumed they'll do that, just like at Pluto's down the street. ?It's not a big deal. ?I just had to dump it in my salad myself. ?It tasted light and refreshing. ?Not too limey and too chili though. 4. ?I was so excited to see soft-boiled eggs as a choice of ingredients. ?I chose that, but I saw the egg split in half sitting on my salad was hard-boiled. ?I asked the salad chef if hard boiled is what I am actually getting or is there a mistake with the menu. ?He didn't explain, but he was nice enough to cut another egg in half to see if he would find a soft-boiled egg. ?No luck. ?He called another salad chef over and new chef said sorry, eggs were seriously overcooked today. ?Next time it will be right. ?Ok, I'll accept that. That's it for the food. ?A salad tastes like a salad. ?There was no skill involved with it. ?As for the place, it's clean, high ceiling, lots of space, and a bit of an echo of noises. ?I have never dined at the Chinese restaurant that used to be at this space. ?I'm sure it was a big transformation though to get the place to its current state. ?I think the ordering/paying/food-readying part has room for improvement. ?The process doesn't flow. ?And the big menu hanging on the wall is the perfect height... if you are a giraffe.

as a proud cal grad, i can equate sprouts as stanford's version of intermezzo, THE place to go for salads in berkeley. the comparison between intermezzo and sprouts truly reflects their campus counterparts. sprouts is more yuppie than hippy-esque intermezzo and more modern than grundgy/natural. but the clear winner has to be SPROUTS. hands down. QUALITY is the key word at sprouts. the ingredients they use are top-notch, and all salads are made-to-order, ensuring freshness. the portions are also GINORMOUS, which definitely makes up for the prices. Pomona salad ($8.95) was delicious and i'm still craving some of that pesto quinoa they put atop spinach greens, shaved fennel, tomatoes, and sugar snap peas. Asian chicken noodle soup was just meh, though. basically chicken broth with pieces of chicken and asian rice noodles. just stick to the salads and you'll be good to go!

I hate to have to write this review for this place, but a conversation with the person I believe to be their owner just forced my hand. I will never be going to Sprout again. It's fine as a grab a salad quick type place, but they are extremely unreliable as a catering business. ?We started ordering from them about once a month. ?The first few times they were late. ?Today, they were almost 2 hours late! ?When I called to complain, they acted as though it should be no big deal and then wanted to charge me. ?They never even called to say they would be late. ?When we called to see where they were (after they were an hour late, but at the point when the luncheon was to start) they said they were on the way. ?They still didn't arrive for 30 minutes. ?When I called the guy gave excuses (like parking) and said I should be more understanding, but all of the issues he raised were preventable and part of the responsibility of a business owner is to anticipate stuff like that! The real rub was that he wanted to charge me for the delivery even though it was more than an hour and a half late! ?I had to argue with him for over 15 minutes before he would even think of not charging me. ?He said he won't, but you can be sure if he does, I will be back to report on it. It's really sad, cause I think they have good food (most of the time), but now I won't be able to eat there again. ?I don't understand how a business owner could make such a silly decision to argue repeatedly with a customer. ?Don't they understand it's bad for business. ?I work for a big company and now we won't order from them ever again. ?Was it really worth the money for this one order?

Sprout is the quintessential palo alto cafe-- it caters to the health-conscious, fresh ingredient, salad lovers among us. Great place if you're feeling lazy and don't feel like throwing together a salad at your home. You can feel good about yourself as you crunch on lettuce, tasty mix-ins, and whole wheat bread while admiring the pictures of carrots artfully displayed on the wall. Prices for the "good" toppings (goat cheese, butternut squash, beets, avocado...) are a bit steep at $1.00 each, and the meats add a fair amount too, but normal full sized salads will usually be less than $10.00 Ingredients are a bit fresher, and more varied than at Plutos, plus the ambiance is a little classier and less frenzied. Good place to go with the girls, but your boyfriend might complain that a salad is not a full meal...

Well It's about time!! The Bay Area is lacking places like Sprout offering gourmet salads that use healthy, fresh, quality ingredients and is also quick. Their salads are big but feel light and refreshing because they don't drown it in heavy dressings. Pluto's just doesn't do it for me and I'm so turned off by the chaotic ordering line and Fresh Choice is...well, not really fresh or healthy, though the "not healthy" part is my fault because I can't resist their pizza breads so I can't ding 'em for that. I just wish they'd open a Sprout in Mountain View.

Sprout is my absolute favorite salad place! The ingredients are ALWAYS the freshest and the customer service is really good too! I'd recommend trying to build your own salad, which is what I always do, mixing in all of my favorite ingredients! =) The Tri-Tip sandwich and the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich is delicious!!! (too bad its a seasonal sandwich!) I'm only knocking one star off because there are several occasions where I've had to wait between 20-30 min for a salad!! Ugh that's frustrating but I deal because it's so worth it in the end! Oh and the cucumber water is fresh and so yum! :D

Came here through two friend's recommendations and enjoyed it very much. This place is pretty much an upper scale Pluto's. I got a BLTA sandwich and it was DELICIOUS. omg the bacon and avocado...soooo yummy~~ it comes with a "side salad" but it's pretty small. I wouldn't really consider it a SIDE salad. More like...a few pieces of lettuce, haha! Haven't tried their salads yet but they look pretty yummy. Also tried a bite of their chipotle sandwich which was delicious as well. It's more pricey than Pluto's but definitely would like to come back when I'm in downtown Palo Alto and looking for a nice place to have a light meal =)

My daughter and I had a great meal here - the concept of "design your own salad" is a great one. You fill out a little order form, choosing from zillions of different salad ingredients, and they whip-up your custom salad for you and deliver it to your table. They have sandwiches and soups too, but the custom salads seem to be the centerpiece, and what a great centerpiece they are.

I tried this place out right after it opened, and have already been back 4 times. The salads are so incredibly fresh - everything tastes like it was just brought in and cooked that morning. ?I've tried the steak and the chicken and they're both delicious and super moist. My friend tried the tofu (i'm not a tofu fan) and she said it was really good. The owner, Van, is there all the time and is the friendliest, nicest guy. I gave him some feedback about the meat (I wanted it cut smaller so that I could have more bites of meat with my salad) and he immediately told his chef to cut the meat smaller for my salad It's more expensive than Plutos but the ingredients are SO much better - it's definitely worth the extra money.

Upgraded to a 5 star review because of something that almost NEVER happens: ?You can eat here with your infant-who-eats-solids without having to bring something healthy from home for said infant. ?In fact, we were recently came in to Sprout because the baby was apparently suddenly famished as indicated by his frantic crying, and just ordered a custom mix of toppings (no greens) for him, even though we the parental units were not hungry yet. ?Very reasonable price ($7ish dollars) for fresh, baby-friendly veggies, fruits, and grains. ?Way more than he could eat in one sitting, so we had leftovers to bring home as well.

built my own salad, which was one of the best salads I've ever tried in my life. however, made the mistake of getting the tri-tip (shoulda asked for it medium rare)... friend's ahi tuna tasted so much better. my combination was: mixed greens + cherry tomatoes, jicama, kaiware sprouts, apples, toasted almonds + the passion fruit citrus vinaigrette + tri-tip = BOMB. would've been bomb-er with the seared tuna, of course. signature salads seem to be a better deal though. (full salad is humungous but only 1.75 more than the half)

Sometimes I just want to eat out a place that makes me feel healthy--Sprout is almost always that option. It's very fresh, has plenty of options, and makes you feel good about yourself when you're done eating. There aren't really a lot of places like that in the area(Pluto's has great salads, but the other options always tempt me away from them). It's great for a quick takeout, but also a good choice to pop in if you're wandering down University.

Wow, menu overload for a first-timer. Got here right at 12:00 for lunch and the line looked bad. But it moved fairly well and our salads came out pretty quick - and huge! I was a bit put off by the price, but after seeing the size of that thing, it definitely was worth it. Their marketing image seems to give off a local/organic vibe, but I didn't any USDA Organic stamps anywhere... Would be interested to see a list of their suppliers. I couldn't find it on their website.

Sprout is my favorite of all the build-your-own salad places I've been. They have incredible variety of ingredients and dressings (especially as compared to Pluto's) and everything is fresh. If you ever venture to try a sandwich, the Chipotle Chicken sandwich is out of this world. I was a long time fan of Pluto's but when Sprout came along I was wooed over by the fancy ingredients (quinoa! kalamata olives!), very exciting dressings (passionfruit citrus is my fave!), and cucumber water (I've thought about making this at home it's so good).

Sprout definitely makes up for the lack of meat on their sandwiches, by using some of the best tasting bread I have ever devoured. The sandwich and salad combinations are creative and delicious. Both the shrimp and steak sandwiches are freshly toasted, almost like a panini except its not pressed as hard. It comes with a side salad dressed with balsamic vinegar dressing. Sprout features a lot of options that are Asian-infused like tofu and egg rolls. Very good place for lunch or food to-go at under $10.

This is a sort of typical boutique salad/sandwich place that you'd find in a city (New York, San Fran, etc), but located in Palo Alto. In Palo Alto, it's (surprisingly) sort of a novelty. They have pre-made salads, sandwiches, soups and a design-your-own salad option.. You get your silverware, sit down at a table and they bring your food out. The servings are big, and the service is fast. I had butternut squash soup and a grilled cheese sandwich and it hit the spot on a cold, rainy day. It was also like $12, which was actually a pretty good deal for how much food I got - the portions are really big. Best thing about the place is the people watching - this appears to ?be the only good salad/sandwich option on University, so apparently everybody comes here for lunch.

Like! ? When this place first opened, I still liked Pluto's a lot better. ?But Sprout has really improved since ?my first trip. ?Now I highly prefer Sprout. ?They have a larger selection of salad toppings, lettuces and dressings to choose from. ?Their meat is also much less greasy. ?They are slightly pricier, but still reasonable (see my review of Mixt Greens, infra). ?Sprout is definitely my go-to weeknight place for dinner now. ?The only real complaint i have is I tried their Asian Chicken Noodle Soup once, and thought it was bland as ----. ?I'm somewhat hesitant to order soups from them again. ?Also, the line can get backed up. ?I still prefer Pluto's business model of putting the salad together as you order rather than having to order your salad then wait for it at your table. ?Yeah, i'm a baby who needs instant gratification. ? But still, you'll probably see me here soon... if you knew what I looked like which, notwithstanding my profile pic, is not a pizza from Gialina's.

Absolutely great place to visit if you're in search for an extremely healthy and filling meal! Sprout boasts fresh, delicious ingredients that you can select in order to make custom salads, as well as standard salads, sandwiches, and soups. Sprout has a ton of ingredient options and fantastic dressings. The restaurant itself is a great place to dine - not too loud so as to drown out conversation, and simple with plenty of seating. A full salad is pretty massive - oftentimes, a half salad is more than adequate (~$5 - $7). Service is friendly and quick , which is always a plus. Though prices are a little higher than Pluto's (down the street), they're definitely justified by the sizable portions. Highly recommend Sprout to anyone looking for a fantastic meal.

Tasty and fresh. Good choice of toppings, although $1 for a spoonful of olives and sundried tomatoes seem a bit much. All in all, great place to create your own salad. They have a good selection of fruit. They had fresh mango which was quite tasty and their bread is really chewy and delicious. The grilled chicken was just OK. Not too flavorful and a bit on the dry side. I like how they have cucumber water. It did take them quite awhile to make our salad, and there wasn't too long of a line. I feel like Pluto has faster service, but I enjoy Sprout cafe more though!

I wanted to like this place. I really, really did. ?I am disappointed. 1. I paid for a $1.50 premium topping and did not receive it. 2. Apparently buckwheat noodles are actually rice noodles. Gross. 3. Gruyere on the croque monsieur tastes unlike any gruyere I've ever had. I don't believe it's actually gruyere. 4. Pretty much every time I've gotten a custom salad, it's missing one of the items I've selected. (Counter Burger can master fulfilling written orders... ?Why can't this place?) 5. Overpriced. 6. A couple times, I've been ready to give my order and one of the order takers is distracted in conversation... A couple things I do appreciate: 1. The dressings are goood. Sesame ginger is the yum. 2. I like how they put on a perfect amount of blue cheese.

I live close by and so I'll definitely go back if I want a healthy alternative.

Upshot-- Seems to be potential here, but order the dressing on the side! I was excited to get my Sprout salad, because they have lots of bins of fresh/yummy looking veggies & greens. The custom salad looked enticing, but I went for the Harvest salad since it was my first time. When it came, I could hardly eat it though, because they had drowned the whole salad in an overload of vinaigrette. The yummy bread helped, but I still couldn't tell the quality of anything, every single part of the salad just tasted like vinegar. Maybe later I'll try again, but I'm just as likely to go to Pluto's instead.

25 minutes for a fucking $10 sandwich before rush time. Terrible service. Going to Pluto's next time. To actually review the sandwich itself. I got a chipotle chicken sandwich. It was actually pretty decent. Has some crunchy things on it which make for a nice contrast in texture. Good heat brings out the taste and the chabatta bread was solid. However I have to give it one star. I can get a chipotle chicken sandwich at Jack in the Box for $5 and it would be almost as good as this one. For it to be worth double the cost and 25 minutes of waiting this sandwich would have to be about 3x as good...it is not. The sandwich comes with a small serving of greens with vinaigrette that's not worth mentioning. More of a garnish. Again, skip this place and head to plutos. It's much cheaper and I can't imagine the wait time being worse.

It takes a lot for me to say I don't like a place... takes even more for me to post a negative review on Yelp. But... The food is definitely above average, but the service is AWFUL. I had 45 minutes for lunch downtown Palo Alto and stumbled upon this place. It never occurred to me that ?I might not have enough time to eat at a soup and salad cafe. Ordered a soup and some other stuff off the menu. It took them 30 minutes to bring out two bowls of soup (and even that, only after I asked twice). When we finally got the soup, I asked about the rest of our order and was informed (in a not-so-polite way) that it would take another 20 minutes. I told the waiter that I no longer had 20 minutes to wait for food and asked for a refund. The guy shrugged, said something in a "whatever, deal with it" tone of voice and walked away. When I went up to the register and said, rather firmly, that I no longer have time to wait for them to pull it together, the guy reached around a small divider and produced my order. Turns out it had been ready all along and they just didn't get around to bringing it out. After all that, another 10 minutes (!!!) went by before the food arrived at our table. There's no shortage of places to eat downtown Palo Alto, so I'm definitely not going back.

Sprout has become a go-to takeout place for me in the last year I've been working in the downtown Palo Alto area. I usually don't have a whole lot of time to run out and get food, and Sprout has been very solid. I get food from here one to two times a week and it is always consistent in quality. The food is made with fresh ingredients and they will always cater to your needs. Bottom-line: they are a solid lunch or dinner place for healthy eats

Expensive, but they have good salads. Great for purging your system when you have ruined yourself with junk food / all-meat massacre the night before. (Don't confuse this with hangover food. If you're hungover, I suggest pho.) A tenner gets you a heaping salad that small people might be able to stretch to two meals, but I definitely can't do that. A big plus is also that they are FAST. Sometimes we've hardly sat down and we already have our food.

8/24/2011 I had the Somen salad (japanese somen noodles, mixed greens, caramelized shallots, kaiware sprouts, carrots, bean sprouts, fresh herbs, crispy wonton strips, roasted chopped peanuts, chili lime vinaigrette) to go. The vinaigrette dressing was not mixed in (and they didn't ask if they should or not) and the amount of dressing was so little that I barely noticed the taste of the dressing in my salad. Other salads may be good, but this one was very very bland; it was dominated by the noodles. I will go back to try other salads. 8/25/2011 I went back the next day because I wanted to have a low calorie meal. This time I chose the ingredients myself and the taste was fine. However, they forgot to put two of the items in my salad and I had to go back and ask for them (egg and baked potatoes). Also, the wait after ordering was between 15 and 20 minutes. I don't really understand why it takes so long to make a salad.

Came here twice and you honestly can't not (yes i know you're not suppose to use a double negative in proper english) help but to compare it to pluto's. Honestly I like Plutos a lot better and i think you get more bang for your buck. Granted you have more variety at sprouts but you're bound to tack on more to your bill. The meat here sucks, pluto's is better. The squash soup is good but the cayenne definitely gives it a bigger punch than expected. If you would like to try something inventive i do recommend the tofu encrusted with furikake.

The food is great but they ALWAYS MESS UP!! I have only been here once when they have not messed up. The only reason I have gone back so many times is because the foods is great, but they always mess it up. Once they messed up my salad 3 times a in a row. Last time I went they filled up salad container half full & tried to convince me it was a full salad it looked the same size as a half salad!! Tonight they gave me cottage cheese instead of blue cheese eww! I have one piece of broccoli & maybe 5 pieces of edamame in my salad, my salad is not edible because of the cottage cheese! They always make you wait a long time for it to be fixed once it's messed up too. They always say it's your fault they messed it up. Their reasoning is the boxes are so close together they get confused. How is that my fault?? I don't like to write reviews but after so many horrible experiences here I decided to finally write a review.

Delicious! It is an awesome place for some grub! We ordered the Kyoto salad, Steak sandwich, Asian chicken noodle soup and corn chowder soup. I thought the Asian chicken noodle soup was delicious! It really hit the spot for me, just very light healthy tasty soup with some noodles in it. I really liked the salad and sandwich. Just something about the fresh textures and the lightness after eating was refreshing. I didn't feel heavy or sluggish after the meal. Definitely a plus in my book! Only downside is it is a little pricey. Other than that I would go for some soup!

My friend and I were walking down University looking at any restaurants that grabbed our attention. ?We walked into Sprout Cafe and noticed a table with clip boards to create your own salad. It seemed very fresh, and we almost starting filling out the paper when we noticed some people were eating sandwiches. So we walked to the back of the cafe where the full menu of sandwiches and salads was displayed overhead. ?So that little clip board is kind of deceiving because it only mentions the create your own salad. ?Anyways we decided to split the turkey sandwich with pesto and cranberry and the cobb salad. ?Both were really good and fresh. We also ordered the strawberry lemonade which I believe was hand made. You could feel the fruit pieces in the lemonade. Kind of pricey...$22 for two people for lunch.

Picking the ingredients I want for my salad was a very stressful experience. You have to think about a theme and how to achieve harmony with all the ingredients! I went through so many forms trying to get it right! They should really have erasers on those pencils.

Grossly incompetent and in violation of health code. 1. Ordered 2 salads to-go. The first was ready in 15 minutes. Then had to wait over 40 minutes for the second. Which meant the first would sit at room temperature for well over an hour before eaten. Room temperature salads and seared tuna anyone? Food poisoning anyone? We finally canceled our order and got a refund, and the manager wasn't even confident that it was refunded on our credit card and told us to "just" give him a call if it's still charged. (We skipped lunch because our baby was on schedule for her lunch. Like, as new parents, we had time to waste over an hour on a weekend and then miss lunch.) 2. When waiting long enough, disturbing observation can be made of their food handlers who continually violate health codes -- like, literally dropping sweat (on numerous occasions in a span of 40 minutes) from their foreheads into the salads as they frantically work; like, dropping tongs on the floor and then picking them up for use; like, food handlers repetitively touching orifices on their faces and then touching food. You can't blame the workers so much as their training program and the company's apparent resistance to hire more help. In the end, what we realize about this trendy downtown Palo Alto cafe is that they sell over-priced, pre-prepared salads that take excessively long to deliver, and instead of balsamic-vinegaret dressing on the side, you'll enjoy human sweat and body fluid mixed in... with a little bit of whatever floor material picked up by the tongs. Yes, the food tastes good, until you watch how it's made. We're not going back.

Good salad - the options are good, similar to Mixt Greens in the city. ?However, it is more expensive than Pluto's and I would say the improved dining experience is not worth the premium. ?I would say this is good for a casual business meeting but for a quick meal for just yourself, probably not worth the premium.

I love Sprout Cafe! They have delicious make-your-own salads! I love mixing together my own salads. My favorite dressing is definitely the miso dressing and I usually go for the asian-inspired salads. Be careful of their tuna. It's delicious, but the pepper makes it very spicy. My roommate is a vegetarian, and this is the perfect place to go as a compromise! Their fried tofu and vegetarian egg rolls are also scrumptious and perfect for your vegetarian amigos!

Sprout is the "upscale" Plutos. Nice and clean atmosphere to chill and have a healthy meal. Fresh ingredients for a great salad. You walk in and grab an order form and check off the ingredients you want on your salad. The meat selection is not that exciting but I typically don't get meat on my salad so I can't complain. Plutos has better meat stuff but Sprout's lettuce is better. After ordering, the cashier/server will bring the salad to your table. One big complaint I have is the horrible service. It takes them forever to bring your salad to you, sometimes to the point of them forgetting.

Im always a bit skeptical about salad/sandwich places like this because I'm easily bored with basics. But to my surprise, they had quite the variety and made it easy to create your salad as well. We had the tri-tip steak sandwich and the sicilian salad (I think that's what it was called), and both were amazingly tasty! My vege-hating friend ate quietly and smiled after the meal. The portions were fairly good and the prices were about $10 per dish. The Sicilian salad had orzo pasta salad with sundried tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, basil and tons of olives. It also had fresh spinach, feta cheese and a generous of delicious fruity olive oil vinagrette. The steak sandwich was delicious as well, and not dry at all, like other places'. Only complaint was the wait to get our food was a bit long, but I'm definitely coming back!

Very fresh salad, offers a more upscale, less hectic environment to Pluto's, but I wouldn't exactly replace Pluto's just yet. ?The two places offer different takes on salad. ?Pluto's is more filling, a little more what you would consider a traditional salad, and less pricey. ?Sprout is great if your taste buds are really bored but you want to put something healthy in your mouth instead of a cupcake.

First time here! I shared a Chipotle Sandwich with a friend. The sandwich was like a mini panini with toasted bread and melted cheese.

Okay, I hate to beat a dead horse, but I came here once for lunch last week and for dinner tonight. Both times, I got a build-your-own salad with tri-tip, but unfortunately, both times I had to send it back because the beef was totally overcooked. Lest you think I'm one of "those" people, each time i was with a different person who agreed that the beef looked totally well-done. Independent verification! Regardless, each time, they did take the salad back and replace the beef, but I really hope that this is something that the restaurant focuses on (I will say, when the tri-tip is cooked properly, I do like it, which explains why I keep ordering it, despite this recurring problem).

Maybe we ordered the wrong thing or went at the wrong time (around 8p), but we had terrible food. ?We had the steak sandwich which was awful- meat was tough and dry, tasteless, like a piece of cardboard, and the bread was hard. ?I was hungry but couldn't even sink my teeth into the thing. ?Best thing about the sandwich was the crispy fries inside the sandwich- basically just picked those off and ate that, threw the rest out. ? The corn chowder was the worst soup I've ever had- tasteless with no flavor at all. It was like a bowl of thick starchy cream with chunks of corn in it. ?Again, had to throw it out. ?Prices were on the higher side for a sandwich/salad place so I was expecting more from the food.

If you're looking for a delicious, fresh, not to expensive salad where you can pick your own ingredients this is your place. This place had the same idea as Pluto's for salads but they have more choices. Their salads are consistently good....probably cause I pick what I put in it. Everything is fresh. I love the mustard soy salad dressing. Their protein portions are decent, but not huge. I have yet to try anything other than salads at this place. If you in need of veggies this is a great place to stop. They close at 5pm on Sundays, which is a little weird, but won't keep me from coming back.

Great salads with unique and fresh ingredients. It's spendy, but worth it. Plutos down the street is faster in tens of service, but their ingredient selection lacks the pizazz of Sprouts. So why the 4 versus the 5 star? ?The wait time for your salad to be prepared is too lengthy. I waited 20+ minutes today. Yes, they are busy and they are always busy.

This is a great place for a healthy meal. I have only had the salads, and the variety of choices is impressive. You can either build your own salad or choose the special ones they have listed. I've done both. When you build your own salad you grab one of the little clipboards with an order form when you walk in and you can choose your ingredients (type of greens, toppings-up to six, costs more for extra, dressing, meat-which costs extra). I have also gotten the Kyoto salad, which was AMAZING. Make sure to get here early at lunch time because the line gets really long.

Highly recommended, easy on the wallet for what you get. I visited this cafe on University. Happened on it by accident while my daughter was shopping next door at American Apparel. ?Checked it out the next day and loved it and plan to make it a frequent stop for a quick healthy dinner or lunch. It is basically a create your own salad cafe, and with house recommended salads, ?but they have sandwiches too, nothing really heavy. I Had the Thai shrimp wrap and my wife had the Orchard salad. Two friends walked in and sat with us and we ended up raving about this place and how fresh the ingredients and how good and healthy the salads tasted. The prices are very reasonable for the large portions of freshly made salads. You do have to wait in line to order. That was the only shortcoming. There were only 3 people working behind the "bar" so it took like 15 minutes before we got our salads delivered to our table. However, it was worth it and luckily we were not famished so okay to wait. All the ingredients are fresh. We left satisfied but not like we had lead in our stomach.Lots of vegan and vegetarian options which I like to go for at times. The ambiance is cafe style. You sit close to others if it is busy, so don't plan on having any discrete converasations however it probably gets pretty noisy if it is crowded since the floors and walls are solid and will probably result in a lot of echo... but the quality and taste and freshness of the food is excellent overall. Highly recommend. I will probably try one of their sandwiches next time.

I was starving and wanted a quick bite to eat, so I thought I'd finally try Sprout. Was that a mistake. It was about 11:45 and only a few people in line ahead of me. I was told my sandwich would be 20 minutes. I had already ordered, but 20 minutes for a sandwich? 40 minutes later I finally got my BLTA. It was fine, but uninspired (it was if I made it at home). My quick bit to eat turned into nearly an hour. It appeared that almost everyone orders salads and they must come out quicker than sandwiches because people that came in way after me got their salads long before I got my food. I don't think I am ever going back to Sprout and if I do I am not ordering a sandwich.

Love love love this place! I have come to place this multiple times for lunch and the food has always been fresh and delicious. I usually go for the tuna nicoise salad or the shrimp lettuce wraps. The shrimp lettuce wraps have fresh baby shrimp, caramelized shallots, a mix of greens, rice noodles, and peanuts that you can mix together yourself and put inside the butter lettuce leaves. The sauce they use to flavor the dish is a sort of light tangy sauce that goes well with the shrimp. I agree with one of the yelpers below that this place is INFINITELY better than Pluto's. Maybe it's because the dishes are more Asian inspired, but regardless I feel like the ingredients used at Sprout are more fresh. Can't wait to go back here :)

I've only been to Sprout twice, once when it opened and again this evening. The first time, the salad was wonderful. Fresh ingredients and great portion size. This second time, however, everything changed. The portions were smaller, the shrimp in my friend's shrimp sandwich was sad looking and she got all of 6 tiny shrimp, the soup literally covered the bottom of a shallow bowl, and our three meals came about 15 minutes apart. Also, the steak in the steak sandwich was dreadfully overcooked. Not sure if they were having an off night, but I'd expect better for the prices and such a prime location in downtown Palo Alto.

They have an amazing selection of ingredients (including tropical fruits, crispy wontons, and panko-crusted tofu) and tons of items are included in the base salad price. They don't have many fat-free or low-fat dressing options, though, so be flexible if you're trying to keep it light. Also, spring for the whole salad- it's only a dollar more than the half-salad and it's easily enough for two meals.

Pretty good salad joint. ?in my opinion better than pluto's down the road with more topping selections. ?a little bit pricey but a lot less trouble than making your own salad at home and mighty tastey too. ?i usually make my own salad but the fruity salad and southwestern salads are both pretty good. usually get my salad to go now b/c this place is really loud when it's busy and it usually seems pretty busy. oh and as a side note... skip the tri tip. ?my boyfriend got it and it's not worth the extra money you have to pay for the "premium topping"

Think of it as a Pluto's with adult supervision. Huge salads, fresh ingredients, wonderful sandwiches and a simple and organized process for ordering your food (rather than the mosh-pit at the Palo Alto Pluto's) Only downside? ?If you order multiple items they seem to make a sport of randomizing your order - one of your party's meal can appear instantly, the next 15 minutes later - with the servers clueless of the time of arrival.

There is one thing you can be certain of when you go to Sprout. ?Order a sandwich, and you'll be made to wait. I can't understand it at all. ?Myself and some coworkers had lunch here today and the salads were all ready in 2 minutes, but the sandwiches were spaced out by 10 minutes. ?It took half an hour to get all our orders. ?It wasn't even busy. Normally the quality of the food would somewhat make up for the wait (I think my record is an hour), but it was subpar all round. ?A shrimp sandwich with just 2 pieces of shrimp. ?A BLTA with burnt, inedible bread. ?Cold chipotle chicken sandwiches. Until they sort out their service and quality control issues, I'd only bother coming here for a nice (but expensive) salad.

I've eaten at the Sprout Cafe twice and have immensely enjoyed the food both times. It's a nice, healthy addition to University Avenue. Although some people might find the prices to be high, I find them pretty reasonable considering the typical dining expense of other restaurants throughout Palo Alto. The restaurant is small, or at least seems so given how crowded it gets at lunchtime. I had a bit of trouble locating a seat during both visits, but managed to snag a table before my food arrived.

I am going through a current obsession with Sprouts. ?I just can't get enough. When my husband and I moved to Palo Alto about a year ago, we tried this place and I chose the southwest salad (which has bad dressing.) ?I decided I didn't like the place. ?A few weeks ago I was craving a big salad and we decided to go back. Thank goodness! I am in love with the Somen salad. Get it with tofu and you will be in business. They have TONS of great salads to choose from, and delicious sandwiches, soups, and appetizers, too. ?The capri sandwich is so so so good! I do have to say that it gets really loud in the restaurant, so if you're looking for a quiet place to chat, bring the salads home. (And ask for extra dressing.)

To give you the quick summary: this place is absolutely amazing. The first time I came here I made my own salad with some sort of ginger dressing, and I must say that it was probably the best tasting salad of my life! I was blown away by the quality of the ingredients used, especially the great dressings. You can tell that the dressings they have are original, carefully made, and bursting with flavor, and the vegetables are also quite fresh and organic. I've had a cobb salad here too which was incredibly tasty as well. I don't think you can really go wrong here, as they seem to only use quality ingredients and also give you control over the ingredients you want. The place is also very clean and for the area the prices are pretty reasonable. I would honestly recommend this place to anyone, the salads are mouth-watering!!! I'm getting hungry just thinking about one...

I had a salad that was pretty good. The ingredients were fresh and the service was quick. However, for $10, there was nothing special about the salad at all.

I am not a fan of having salad for a meal, but for Sprouts I am always willing to make an exception. I started coming here a while ago when it first opened and I have never been disappointed. I enjoy making my own salad and their produce and meats taste so fresh and crisp. I wish they had more appetizing options on their menus for already made salads, but either way, I always find myself making a pretty bomb salad. Another thing I should point out which impressed me, they have great options for ingredients to go into your salad and I ordered ?pan seared tuna which tasted so fresh and had not smell to it at all. The only downfall with this place is that it is on the pricey side for a platter of vegetables so that limits my visits, but whenever I would recommend for everyone to try it out if your willing to eat leafy greens for your meal.

Love this place. ?Probably eat at Sprout two days a week. ?Here's one reason why this place is so great... I sent an email to the Sprout general email address asking if they would consider adding cottage cheese to their menu (obviously I gave a number of reasons why cottage cheese should be added and why it made sense, etc.). ?I was told they would consider it. ?Sure enough, a few weeks later Sprout added cottage cheese to their menu. ?Sprout was able to source a local dairy farmer who delivers the cottage cheese. ? I recommend everyone tries cottage cheese on their salad (to replace salad dressing).

I'm staying at the nearby Hotel Keen. I was looking for fresh and healthful takeout, and it turned out Sprout was close by. I downloaded their takeout menu and called in an order for the Rocky salad (chicken, spinach, arugula, grapes, fried onions and other good stuff). It really hit the spot, and came with a piece of incredibly fresh whole grain bread. The salad is good enough that you barely need to use any of the ranch dressing that comes with it. I'll definitely be going back to Sprout next time I'm in Palo Alto.

I was glad to see another salad place open up on University as Plutos is slow, overhyped and a bit of a scene. However, ?Sprout seems to think that a salad that is 90% greens and what people want, either that or they are trying to minimize costs. ?They need to be a lot more generous with the other ingredients. ?If I wanted a plate full of spinach I would just go to the grocery store.

Had the chipotle chicken sandwich. It came with a good portioned side salad. The sandwich was good, except I thought it was a little too spicy. The service is a little slow considering they serve mostly salads and sandwiches-waited over a 1/2 hour for a sandwich. Great quality ingredients, so I didn't mind paying almost $10 for a sandwich. I would come back again to try a custom made salad, but I think I'll avoid the lunch hour this time.

Sprout Cafe is all about the salads. I love building custom salads. They have a form you can fill out with a list of tons of toppings you choose from. It's kind of overwhelming at first, but once you get a basic idea of what you want, it's simple. The ordering is great because you really get what you want. I always had a problem with the chaotic ordering system at Plutos - there you have to yell out what you want to the salad guy and he inevitably gets it totally wrong. But at Sprout, there's no question about what you want. I've been very impressed and happy both times I have been there!

Used to love this place when i lived in the bay. Came from LA to meet with bff. Ordered salads. I waited and waited for them to bring mine for more then 30mins wtf it takes 2mis to make?! Finally went to pick it up at counter cuz they didnt give me an order number, wtf?? Paid extra for avocado and olives. Had NO avocado and exactly 1olive!!! I got pissed and went to complain cuz by that time it was over 30mins and my bff finished her salad and sat waiting for me instead of us catching up! They asked if I wanted another salad cuz while looking at it and telling me they didnt have avocados and saying sorry they only put one olive (and she touched the damn salad with her hand, by accident?) ...I was pissed and said I just want my $ back for my half salad ( I dont think I ever asked for $back on food before but at this point I was hungry and pissed lol). ?She couldnt find my order number and I had to go through the bathroom trash, where I stupidly threw my receipt (who needs it anyways usually?). Finally she found my order and refunded my ~7$, it was now about closing time and my friend sat there lonely and bored while I was hungry and super pissed at how stupid this situation was. And btw the trash in the bathroom looked like it hadnt been emptied all day, which just makes the place look dirty and unsanitary. This happed to me once before at this restaurant, when they forgot to put an ingredient and charged for it as well as to other reviewers on here. So managment you should really get it together before someone calls the 'restaurant patrol' on you :x. As good as the salads always were here and even though this used to be one of my fav placces to eat, dont think ill be going back anytime soon.

Being as all things sprouted are pretty much my life mantra (see even my biz logo is a sprout and what i do for a living-- helping women have babies is pretty much about sprouting..) its rather amazing that 2 years later on the peninsula, this was my first lunch at the Sprout Cafe. It was excellent in my book. Attention in the details of produce (watermelon radish on the menu??? that's a swoon moment for me) and i appreciated the protein choices-- i had mine w/ ahi, which was lovely. A larger salad, good service, unique foodie ingredients, iced GREEN tea as well as your regular black and looks like they even have a liquor license if that's your craving (rarely mine, but may be my partner in dining.) I was here early at 11:30 and was readily served but i noticed it was slammed at noon. Yum sprouts! Thanks for doing me right with lunch after dance class... i won't let you become a stranger!

I don't think I really need to add anything about the food, but I prefer Sprout to Pluto simply because I think Pluto's ordering system is just not very efficient or organized. By comparison, I am much more comfortable ordering at Sprout rather than Plutos, as I sometimes have a hard time remembering what I want on my salad at Pluto's, since you give your order form to the guy making your salad.

I don't usually order a salad as an entree, but this place seemed to be all about such I thing. So I came with my roommate for a try and it was decently good. Like good good. I got the signature salad, the "Howdy," which I was quite pleased with. Being that it is pretty much a low prep food, it comes out quick and the service is very kind I thought. They ran out of forks (common I am guessing in such a place) and anxiously tried to scramble the washing of forks immediately. It was nice but a little rushed ;) ?Anyways, it's quick it's semi healthy ( I think the dressing and cheese on all the salads removes the healthy aspect ) But I was full. They have a daily soup too which was taunting me. I love corn chowder but I wanted a side soup and they only seemed to serve a bowl :( Next time ... next time :) It's a little pricey for being a soup/salad/sandwich place but it's pretty good quality wise.

Maybe it's because I came with my friend during the lunch time rush but ?man it took a long time to get our complete order. My friend ordered a salad with orzo pasta and I ordered the tuna nicoise salad. We asked for the dressing on the side. My friend got her order first. 5 min later we wonder where her side dressing was and where my order was. We called over the server and said that we were missing our side dressings as well as my nicoise salad. He then said that my nicoise salad would take 10 more min because they had to grill the tuna. I kind of wish the person who took my order would have told me that before hand. The server eventually get got my friend's dressing in. 10 plus min pass and I eventually get my salad with no side dressing. ?I flagged down the server again, who at this time looked a little perturbed and asked if I could have the side dressing that I ordered with this dish. ?A few min later I got the dressing but it seemed a bit too sweet to go with the nicoise. I'll probably pass on the nicoise salad the next time I go. Perhaps the other salads will be better.

I do keep going back because I like their salads but I'm getting a little tired of their inconsistency. During the last 3 visits, I have ordered custom salads and each time they have left out at least 1 item from my order. ?Today they left out 3 items that I paid extra for. ?I didn't figure it out until half of my salad was already eaten. ?It's aggravating. ?Check your orders carefully!

In search of a great salad place that is healthy and hearty in size. Sprout seems to have a healthy menu of salads. I love the variety and the option to make your own. I had the nicoise tuna salad and although it was good, it was not your traditional nicoise salad. The majority of the salad was full of lettuce. Instead of red potatoes, there were herbed steak fries. The fries were good but it wasn't as clean tasting and feeling. The toppings were slim. Only a few pieces of seared tuna. Nicoise tends to have very few lettuce and more hearty ingredients like red potatoes, chunks of tuna, eggs, olives, etc. But this salad was mostly just lettuce. I liked the lemon vinigrette. Good salad but not really nicoise. Left slightly satisifed but quickly hungry.

If only I lived near this restaurant I could consume healthy deliciousness every single day or at least twice a week. ? My friend and I beat the lunch rush which after 30 minutes was insane. ?I tried the Kyoto and it is such a great deal for 10 bucks. ?The pepper crusted ahi tuna was DELICIOUS over mixed greens, vermicelli, tofu. ?I think every single salad on the menu sounded amazing. ?Must try again.

Good, but I prefer Pluto's. Its quite expensive, portions are relatively smaller, and not as hearty. Its more frou frou though, and the decor is brighter and prettier, so I understand why people'd like it. I also was unable to really work there because the lights were too dim. I think I went here once and never came back.

Sprout has decent food, but it is way overpriced for what it is. ?The atmosphere is probably more in line with the affluence of Palo Alto than is Pluto's, but if you're a college student, Pluto's tastes a little better and is more economical. ?Sprouts does have more options, but especially if you are getting a salad, you don't actually watch it getting made like you would at Pluto's. ?They tend to skimp a little on the premium toppings that they make you pay extra for - sundried tomatoes, avocado, brussels sprouts, and a whole host of other vegetables are $1 each for minimal amounts, and you have to pay between $1.95 and $3.95 extra to add meat to your salad. ?For slightly lower quality than a Pluto's salad, you end up paying $3 to $4 more; Sprout is good but not quite worth it unless you don't really care how much you're spending.

Went here a few times and really wanted to like it as I'm a HUGE fan of salads. Great concept and seemingly fresh ingredients, but the service leaves something to be desired. The last 2 times that my husband and I went here, they forgot 1-2 ingredients in his salad. Mind you, they were the most expensive ingredients on the menu too. The salad guys were not at all apologetic about it when we pointed it out. Also, on our last visit, not only did they forget an ingredient, but they also gave 3 small pieces of beets for a freaking dollar. When asked about it, they rudely refused to give more and said that's the norm. Right as we were leaving, I saw another woman also complain that one of her salad ingredients was left out. WIll not be coming back here - more business for Loving Hut that's right across the street. They are always super nice and clean there and, most importantly, the food is delicious!

Love Sprout. It beats Plutos on the food for sure. I've eaten in and taken it out. I absolutely love the Davy salad without the candied walnuts and with the low fat miso dressing. It's about 400 cals that way and very substantial. I enjoy the lettuce wraps too. Ive heard that the nicoise is great, although I personally don't like olives. So okay, the food is good, but the service is absolutely horrible. They are so disorganized. If they don't figure their stuff out, then they're seriously going down a path to failure. It should not take 5-10 mins to order from the incompetent cashiers and 10-15 for the painfully slow guys to make a salad (that at least twice for me was made incorrectly). Additionally, the line gets very confusing. Also, I hate when people come in to pick up a called in order and get to skip ahead a 10 person line to the front to pay/pick up. I guess the way to do it here is to order ahead so you can cut in front of everyone who's been somewhat patiently waiting in line for like 15 mins. Don't even get me started on the service while eating in. I'm giving it 4 stars for the food and because I don't want people to miss out on the great salads. But honestly Sprout, get your stuff together.

not bad. not great. slightly expessive, but a great place for a light lunch/dinner. i still prefer plutos, however not a bad alternative. after a salad dinner, hit up red mango down the street for a frozen yogurt treat! you deserve it. :)

I've been going to sprout for dinner for a few months. Hey, it's just like Plutos, but you write it down, not point. Seriously, salads are great, staff is great, prices are a few bucks more than Plutos (as I remember). Salad is larger, less bread on the side.

My favorites here are the lentil soup, the sesame tofu appetizer and their chipotle chicken sandwich. Overall, you get consistent quality, fresh food and a vibrant dining area, filled with Stanford students. On the downside, it is a tad expensive for a salad.

We've been to Sprout's a couple of times. ?The main impression: ?great food, odd/off service, noisy. ?We really enjoy the food - very fresh, nice recipes, good salads, the steak and chicken sandwiches are very good. ?All the food we've had has been very good and the value for the food is good. ?I would have given them 5 stars if not for the service and the facilities. ?Standing in line to order gives it a fast food feel. ?They give you a number for your table, but in both visits the food did not come out at the same time. ?Our 'appetizer' came out way after the main dishes (we sent it back and got a refund). ?They really need to work out the service aspect. ?Plus the facility is WAY too noisy - we couldn't even hear each other without talking very loudly.

This place is great... I have been going there since it opened and they have added a bunch more items to their menu. However I have noticed lately that they are being really skimpy on their salads and dressing which it turns makes you order more dressing. I am interested to see how they keep the product so good with the high prices and the skimpy sides. Just don't expect a lot for little $.

Well, this place was off to a great start, but they have seriously clamped down on portion size. ?It seems a serving of chicken is now about 2 ounces. ?Secondly, super slow service can be forgiven for the first several months, but it's time these guys got their act in gear. ?We'll be back, but hopefully things will improve.

I went here today with 2 of my friends and we all loved it! Despite the random egg that one of my friends got on her salad, and the lack of feta cheese on my other friend's salad...the food was awesome! I had the soup special of the day- Chicken Noodle Soup and it was really really good! My friends each ordered a salad and the butternut squash soup (also very good). I definitely recommend this place for a nice, quick lunch or dinner!

This salad based restaurant is definitely better for salads than Pluto's down the street. Mostly organic and many more unique and interesting choices. ?I loved the crunchy tofu steak on mine. ?It wasn't greasy and did not seem to be deep fried either. Very unique and delicious! ?I wouldn't recommend the chicken and vegetable soup though, since it looked like it was just chicken and vegetables from the salad dumped in hot broth. ?It was OK, but just felt like I was eating a soup that was a vehicle for leftovers. ?One of my friends had a BLTA that looked really good too.
