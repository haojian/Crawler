They do the real deal BBQ and make the best corn bread ever! Okay I admit I like cornbread and this place makes it good. ?The atmosphere is country diner with your standard barbecue fare: ribs, chicken, sliced beef, and hot links. Basically, anything you order is going to be awesome yet the price comes with awesomeness. This place hits the spot when you crave BBQ and can't do it yourself. Beggars can't be choosers.

I'm a chicken and fish kinda girl but I will break my habits for their pork! Last time I was there I got pulled pork and chicken with cornbread and Mac and cheese. My eyes were a little bigger than my stomach...ok a lot bigger. But it was so worth it to get a lot and try a little of everything. They also have like 6 different BBQ sauces on the tables. My favorite was this vinegary, sour, spicy one. I'm not much into the sweet sauces but they were pretty good too. Another huge plus to this place...you can bring your own booze in with you to have while you eat. We brought a six pack from home. Great place!

Worst. Ribs. Ever. Every time I eat here I swear I'll never go back but there's no other BBQ nearby. This last order of ribs had not one juicy bite. It was all bony, gristly or just rock hard pork. Either the quality of meat was poor or they were way overcooked. So unsatisfying. Same story with everything else i've ever ordered - either overcooked or bad cuts of meat. Plus it's all way overpriced. And the worst part is they are BBQ snobs. For a cuisine with such friendly, down to earth roots, these people are incredibly arrogant.

I love BBQ and only ate here once. 18 bucks for a burger is some bullshit. ?The burger was undercooked too. ?I'm very particular about my bbq and for the price it wasn't worth it. ?I really really wanted to like this place but I couldn't bring myself to splurge on the ribs after eating the mediocre burger. ? Don't get me wrong the food was good but not for the price.

I don't understand why Memphis Minnie's doesn't have better ratings because as far as BBQ goes, this is as good as it gets in SF. ?(And I've had Sneaky's, Baby Blues, Catheads, Smokin' Warehouse, T-Dubs on Friday's. ?Gorilla is also good but that is in Pacifica.) I've eaten my way through KC BBQ and MM's pork ribs are second only to Oklahoma Joe's in KC. ?I ordered a half slab and received a mixture of long and short end ribs. ?They were delightfully smokey with a visually appealing smoke ring, and fell clean off the bone. ?The mouthfeel was not as tender as OKJ's but good if you like your meat to have some texture without being tough or dry. ?No need for sauce because the seasoning was good overall, maybe the short ends were a tad oversalted but not too offensive. ?Now all they need to do is serve those ribs with some Wonderbread and a pickle. ?:) ?I also love the brisket and pulled pork at MM's and my friend from the deep South enjoyed their smoked fried chicken. Only complaints: Prices are 2-3 bucks more than they ought to be ($15.25 for a half slab of ribs?!!). ?Also, my one experience with the tri tip was that it was very dry, so I have avoided it ever since. ? And last but not least, the service is always great here. ?Even when it is crowded, the employees do a good job getting you seated and then getting your food fired in a timely fashion.

Horrible chewy meat Owner blamed the chef and publically humilated him. Then turned ?when he realised word would get out. Creepy owner is super sleazy and does not care about giving any respect to poor guys who slog working for him or customers. Save ur money find some other place who does real bbq.

The quest to explore all the different bbq SF restaurants have to offer continues... We went to Memphis Minnie's because our original plans for Ricky Bobby was foiled because they had no power and had to close for the night. No worries, there were other options around the area and we settled on Memphis Minnie's figuring we can't go wrong with such an establishment right? Wrong! In our 3 person party, I split 3 meat combo while my friend had an andouille sausage sando. The St. Louis ribs were dry and tough like jerky (parts were beyond inedible), the sausage was dry, and I don't know what was up with the brisket! I hope it's because we went in an hour before closing because we were quite disappointed with the food that I had to stop eating altogether. After all the recommendations I've heard from others in the past, I was disappointed. Their saving grace was the nice cashier and the different bbq sauces to experiment and choose from.

Just moved to SF and this was the first BBQ place I've been to. Now, I LOVE me some ribs. LOVE 'EM. Memphis Minnie's was...good. Seems everyone on here had dry, chewy meat. My ribs didn't exactly fall off the bone, but they had some good flavor. The sauces available were ok. The only one I liked was the Red sauce. The cornbread was good, as was the potato salad. Can't say I'll rush back to Minnie's; I think I'd rather search the city for some better places. But if you're on Haight on you have a craving for BBQ, I don't think you'll leave disappointed.

Super Bowl Sunday BBQ ruined! ?After reading all the reviews of various BBQ joints I decided to buy BBQ at ?Memphis Minnies for this special day. We are from the south and the reason for choosing this place was -they advertise they do slow smoking and have a southern style mustard based sauce. ? What a dissappointment. The mustard BBQ sauce tastes just like the cheap store bought stuff. ?This is nowhere close to Southern Style BBQ. The meat (brisket) is super fatty. We bought the Texas Style and the Sweet Smoked Style, both were nearly 40% fat- I mean grossly fatty!! . And the prices are astronomical. The sides are equally as bad. The Mac and cheese is made with a roux so it has tons of flour in it to thicken it up--just gross. The collard green come swimming in the sickeningly sweet, cheap mustard based sauce. Terrible all the way around--really bad BBQ!

Beggers can't be choosers but I was thoroughly unimpressed with Memphis Minnie's. I got the pork sandwich with a modest side of mac n' cheese and a Shiner Bock. Ran me about $15-$16 (overpriced). The mac n' cheese was good despite the portions. The sandwich on the other hand was only mediocre. The roll was ciabatta bread or something similarly tough. That just doesn't cut it for anyone that's actually from the South.

Trying to find BBQ near the peninsula is harder then I thought. Spent almost $40 bucks for two fountain drinks, an BBQ sandwich and a tri tip plate. Now, if it's finger licking good, I'm cool with spending that kind of money for it, but seriously for coming all the way down the lower Haight and meter parking, it wasn't worth the drive. Here's what would have made our visit here worth it. -Bigger sides. For $17.95 got a few pieces of trip tip, a small corn muffin and two sides that were so so tiny... I was like, that's it? Mine that ALL THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS. ESPECIALLY THE MAC & CHEESE. But for that price for portion size, it just wasn't worth it. We're talking like less then half a cup. For real. :/ -Juicier and more favor on the tri tip please. : ) Maybe I was a vampire in another life but I like my tri tip a little on the bloody side. The sandwich my husband had was much better then my plate. Great vibe and really chill staff there, but it just wasn't worth the drive for the price.

Before I cared about becoming obese, I came here frequently. It is a solid BBQ place. I am from Texas, so I have high standards. This place is not what I use to eat in Texas, but it is a good compromise. I like that they have a variety of sauces (I feel like I have power). If I did not care about my heart - I would still come here. Unfortunately the heart burn that results from their food is enough to keep me away. Thanks for the fond memories, Memphis Minnie's.

My experience at Memphis Minnie's wasn't so enjoyable, though the food was good. The line was about 15 people long and didn't move quickly. The cashier was answering calls, including to-go orders, and losing her train of thought during the in-person orders. Given the popularity of their table covers were sticky, ? A few people ahead of us in the line, the last sandwich roll had been purchased... at 845pm on Friday, 4/20. Hmmm, I didn't see that coming before heading to the Lower Haight to try their burger and BBQ. Darn. If you visit Memphis Minnie's when it isn't too busy, you'll have a decent experience for a fast-casual type of restaurant that cooks a variety of meat/BBQ dishes.

Very disappointing, but I was craving BBQ and this place has so many reviews, I thought I'd try it. ?Mistake. The OK: Chili Cheese Fries - Fries covered in chili and cheese? ?How can you go wrong? ?The chili was actually one of the better things in my meal. ?The fries were seasoned and didn't really compliment the chili at all, but this was really one of the better dishes we had. Pork Ribs - This were alright. ?I've had so much better, but they fell off the bone. ?They were a little fatty, but I didn't really mind that. ?Cover the meat in sauce and it may satisfy some part of your BBQ craving. The Bad: Beef Ribs - Sooooo bad! ?The ribs basically had pieces of burnt meat on them. ?You couldn't even get anything edible off the bone. ?Such a disappointment cuz I love beef ribs! Slaw - I know this was supposed to be tangy, but it was overly sweet and sour. ?An awful combination. I know SF doesn't have many good BBQ places, but this place was just plain bad! ?I'd rather go to Hard Knox or Roadside BBQ. ?They don't have the best BBQ either, but at least I like some of their dishes!

We only stopped briefly for some wings but they were quite well done. The fat was fully rendered, leaving a very crisp smoky wing with just enough seasoning to stand up to the sauce of your choice. Perhaps a tad bit overpriced, but I would have rather come here than get food poisoned next door.

Once you get away from the bland overpriced drek of the financial district, or the sheer awfulness of the over-touristed Fisherman's Wharf, you can then explore the real culinary delights of this greatest of American cities. This is one. I discovered this place by accident while visiting friends who lives literally a block away. No way, I thought...bbq in the city of hippies and the 10,000th iteration of Asian fusion? Yes, yes, and yes. Memphis Minnies blew me on my ass...and I know bbq, having eaten it in almost every state in the union. The owners here did their homework...traveling to the great bbq Meccas and taking careful notes. The meats I tried here were perfectly smoked, the greens and other sides just first rate. My favorite thing? Check out that cherubic grinning cartoon pig's head that is their logo. The underground artist Robert Crumb, one of my heroes, drew this just for Minnie's. So if you are on a gastronomic tour of the great city by the bay, get off the goor-may train for a spell, ground yourself back to Earth, and come here. Sit a spell. Be sure to have the cornbread. I am writing this from bbq crazed Texas and OMFG do I miss this place.

Fairly average BBQ in every way imaginable. The Memphis sweet-smoked pork wasn't all that memorable upon first bite, so what made the meal for me was being able to douse it with all the sauces available right at my table. The beans, mac and cheese, and cornbread were also good... as in merely good. My friend had the same view about his pork rib appetizer and BBQ pork rolls. A bit pricey for what you get, although the portions are filling. Service was nice and courteous. Seems like the place is going for a really casual, down-home vibe with the picnic table-like setup and the large rolls of paper towels in lieu of real napkins.

Point 1) I am from Memphis, and I know good BBQ. ?This is NOT good BBQ. ?The sandwiches are small, and overpriced. ?Prepare to pay $15 for a sandwich and a beer for substandard BBQ. ?The mac and cheese is good, but that's about it. ?I promise you. Point 2) I came there with two friends. ?We bought two full meals at this place, and my friend brought in a sausage from across the street. ?The owner came up to us and instead of kindly asking us to leave (a reasonable move - we would have understood and just left), he proceeded to give us a condescending lecture on "how to run a business" and was very confrontational. ?I couldn't tell if he was kidding or not because his unprompted diatribe was so ridiculous. ?Not a good "business move," if you ask me. ?He just drove away a few local customers.

I went here once about three years ago and didn't like it. I couldn't remember why, and this was pre-Yelp so I had no frame of reference. I decided to give it another go. Then I remembered why I didn't like it. It's not good. Maybe because I go there after work but the ribs tasted like they were reheated from yesterday. I do this with my own ribs at home sometimes and you can definitely tell by the texture. The chicken was super dry. The pork was okay, but again, tasted old. A lot of people like this place. I was contemplating this and recalled that most of the people there when I was picking up my order appeared to be drunk. Not to begrudge drunkards their drink, but clearly they are in no position to judge BBQ. Maybe I'll try again in another three years but this is one of the not-so-great BBQ joints in the city.

AMAZING staff. i was always the little girl chowing down her brisket, so they were always so nice, and often gave me a free dessert. a few years ago, they thought it was hilarious i was such a fan of this place, being the young skinny ballet dancing girl i am, and they gave me a free shirt.

Been here more than a dozen times over the years and it's always been great. We've had about almost everything on the menu. today for some reason...it WAS THE BEST ever!! The brisket was fatty and juicy just the way I like it, and very smokey! Had the beef ribs this time around too and man oh man...delicious smoked yumminess. Awesome portions to put u in a BBQ coma. I'm still drooling... Not that it was never good, but they must've made all their sides extra fresh today or something bc my husband and I ate all that food plus four sides that came with our meals. Usually I'm too stuffed to finish the sides, but today was something else. Will keep coming back, especially since the people who work there are all super nice and caring of their customers and product.

There's just so much dry BBQ I can handle.. On the prowl with my girlfriend for some good ol' BBQ lead us to Memphis Minnie's in San Francisco's Haight district. As I was parking my car across the street, the aroma of charred meats instantaneously drew me in! ..oh damn, I forgot to feed the meter! Minnie's Taster - http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­ 3 Meats + 2 Sides + 1 Cornbread = $20.95 - St Louis Style Smoked Pork Ribs - Charred and DRY. - Texas Beef Brisket - Bland and DRY. - Memphis Sweet Smoked Pork - Pretty good. Moist, tender, and just a hint of sweetness. - Tart N' Tangy Slaw - The tart and tang was definitely there! - Mac & Cheese - COLD. Crispy Fried Onion Strings - http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­ The fries were really good. Very light, crispy, and they gave you a mountain of the stuff! Gotta order some! Memphis Minnie's Sauces - http://www.yelp.com/user¡­ There's 4 house sauces at each table side but I really couldn't differentiate the differences. Like the "Beelzebub's" sauce claimed to be "Super Hot", but it hardly even tickled my tongue. The "Texas Red Sauce" was tangy but it personally didn't do it for me. The "South Carolina Mustard" wasn't bad, though I was hoping for a horseradish-type kick, it still delivered. I love all the pig-oriented decor, artistic pig drawings on the tables, and really great friendly hospitality, but the BBQ just didn't cut it. My girlfriend and I came in the mid-afternoon and maybe it's just me, but the BBQ gave the impression that it has just been lying about like a mediocre buffet, and upon your order, it's reheated (hopefully not microwaved) back up.

So, BBQ Anyone? YESSSSSS PLEEEEEASE!!!! The BF and I come here when our pockets are overflowing with extra cash ( Which is almost never), but the times I have been here, FANFREAKINTASTIC! They lost a star due to dry brisket, but make up for it with their spicy mac n cheese, and their sanwiches-TO DIE FOR! If I could, I'd eat their everyday and never get tired of it!!! I recommend the MAC N CHEESE ( HUGE CROWD PLEASER), and the PORK RIBS after 4 pm, before 6pm, that way theyre still juicy and scrumptious!!! Parking around the neighborhood can be quite an issue, but well worth it. NEVER order delivery- they have a guy on a bike who hauls ass trying to bring you your delivery, just go pick it up!

I was very eager to try one of the only BBQ joints in the hood, but was sorely disappointed in the complete lack of cleanliness here. ?I'm trying to be nice as it was down right disgusting! ?Where do I begin....from the cleaning supplies (gallons of bleach etc) hanging in the kitchen area amongst the food, to the dirty walls with years of scum & dirt, the old t-shirts hanging on the walls incrusted with years of dust bunnies, to the sticky/dirty table cloth with the last 10 dinner's crumbs still on it. ?Not to mention the reviews hanging on the walls from 2001 & 2003...seriously...in 2012? ?Not to mention my food was barely room temperature and the meat my boyfriend ordered was pink & so raw that he wouldn't touch it. ?This owners of Memphis Minnie's should be ashamed!

Memphis Minnie's, You guys lost a loyal customer tonight. Not because of the food, but because your customer service fucking sucks. I always phone order and even tip when I come in to pick up my food. One thing I do require is extra sauce. I know they style of bbq can leave some of the meat dry and I'm good with that, but I consume a lot of bbq sauce. when I request extra bbq sauce it means I don't want the two you automatically give. So when the dude with the backwards hat and the beard hands me my food, I ask him "Is there extra sauce in there?" and he says "Ya". I'm inclined to believe him. ?Well, thanks for lying to my face, and not thanking me for my business. I will now be telling everyone how I hate Memphis Minnie's with a passion. I almost fainted I'm so pissed.

3 for 3 Memphis Minnie's!!! Three times I've been here in the past 6 years... this last time as an official resident of "The City" and I love you MM :) Yes, your sauces are a little runny (I'm used to thicker, richer sauces) and yes, the brisket chili cheese fries were just a tad too salty for my taste (which the manager said they would gladly take my request for less or no seasoning salt next time) but it doesn't matter because overall the food is just delish! Everytime I've come I've ordered something different and have always been completely satisfied with my meal... and the super-absorbent paper towels :) The corn muffin is just the right amount of sweet, warm and corn-y. The brisket, when I had it, was NOT too dry or NOT too greasy. The cole slaw is tangy and sweet. The mac & cheese was creamy. The crispy fried onion rings flavorful.The pork meat on the pork sandwich was cooked just right and the roll itelf was soft and warm. I'd give you 4-stars be it not for the following: Your cashiers (2 out of the 3 times) were not the friendliest, the picture above the soda fountain with the pigs being carried thru the streets of Vietnam is rather disturbing (they were caged, ouch) and lastly... you don't have ranch dressing!!! How do you not have ranch dressing?? Is ranch just a SoCal thing? I hope not. Overall, you guys do good work... Just please take down the picture of the poor piggies, train your cashiers to be a friendlier, start stocking ranch dressing and I will gladly stop coming here when... Pigs Fly! ;)

Pros: - Good smoke. - Good bark. - Good Mac and Cheese (voted best sides by my co-diners) - Excellent service. - Price is reasonable for the volume of food. Cons: - Meat needs more rub. - Beef ribs and rib tips were on the chewy side. - Sauce was thin in texture and flavor. - Corn muffins were dry. ?(Hard Knox has better.)

I ordered a combo plate with 3 items: -- St Louis Style Pork Ribs -- Rib Tip Plate -- Texas Beef Brisket (smoked 18 hours) It was all delicious, but I have to say that I am quite surprised at how much I enjoyed that beef brisket. ?It was much more tender than I expected. ?I might have even enjoyed it more than the ribs (and I really love to pick at a bone). Comes with four sauces: -- North Caroline vinegar -- South Carolina mustard -- Beelzebub's -- Texas Red Sauce. I'm not much a mustard fan, but I did love the other 3, especially mixing the vinegar with the spicy Beelzebub. https://sphotos-a.xx.fbc¡­

Experienced Memphis Minnie's BBQ at our work place and decided to try their food anonymously before ordering their food for our birthday and 49er party. The brisket, sweet pulled pork and potlikker greens were good. After sampling most of their menu, we ordered brisket, sweet pulled pork, potlikker greens, mac 'n cheese, cole slaw and corn muffins for 24 people. We were assured by Matt that the food will arrive 5 minutes early to set up their food for an extra $50 charge. They arrived 40 minutes late! No telephone call prior to late arrival by Memphis Minnie. Setting up the food while our guests were arriving was embarrassing and not impressive. Sorry!

I found the food here to be underwhelming. I wanted to like it but it was mediocre bbq imo. I went for the ribs and they were overdone and somewhat dry (also not cheap for what looked like a half rack of ribs). The end pieces were like beef jerky. They still had soem flavor despite this fact but the bbq sauce on them didn't have a lot to it either. The potatoe salad was delicious I have to say, the mac and cheese was ok. Perhaps they were having an off night with the meat? I'll come back and try again since I live so close by.

Not bad for my first BBQ experience in SF! A couple friends and I followed our noses after some amazing smoky meat wafted into Molotov's next door. I went with the pulled pork sandwich and my meat was incredibly tender, smoky and flavorful. Plenty of sauce options (I lovelove mustard and vinegar based BBQ sauce and they had both) though beware of the bottle that says spicy. I like my food spicy, but this was like fire in my mouth! Fried cheese grit sticks were interesting, but kinda tasty. Definitely not a must have.

Just meh. I hope I didn't go there on a bad day. I ordered the burger but after paying for it they told me they ran out of patties. They recommended the brisket and I was expecting a brisket sandwich but they gave me the full meal with two sides at no additional cost. Yay. GOOD Mac and cheese is terrific. The peach pies were delicious with a sprinkle of powdered sugar. MEDIOCRE Shredded porn and beans was bland and could've used some salt. The brisket was a bit dry but maybe that is why they have those squeeze bottles full of sauce. One of the caps was leaking and dribbled vinegar sauce all over the place. The sauce was the only thing that redeemed the dish and that is not saying much. There was nothing special about the cornbread. SERVICE Everybody is super friendly and a guy was walking around and asking us if all was fine. COST I paid $15 for a $19+ dish.

came in here on a cold nigt and was dismayed to find it was cold inside too. But it smelled good. ordered brisket and collard grees and slaw...everything was pretty damn delicious but sadly after a long-ish wait to get our food, the meat was lukewarm. ??? I really wanted some piping hot food and everything was almost room temperature...delicious but off-putting in temperature. I love the bottles of sauce on the tables...and used them generously as the brisket was just on the verge of being too dry. but it tasted good. oh and did I mention it was a bit too expensive for the type of place it is, the fact that you get your own food from the counter and it was not hot? for dinner set me back about $25. ?For that amount, I could have sat down and had a steak. I am not saying I would not come back, just that there are things I wish had been a bit better that's all.

I always order ribs, brisket and links as a measure of a good BBQ joint, and Minnie's seemed promising. I was in the area on an errand and drove by the restaurant, so decided to Yelp it. Good reviews, so I stopped in. I ordered my usual, with Mac n Cheese based on reviews and Potlicker Greens cuz I love my greens, n got my order to go. It came with their slightly sweet BBQ sauce as well as their tangy mustard sauce. Not sure if I caught them on a bad day, but the food was very average. Good BBQ is tasty when smothered in the sauce, but Great BBQ can stand on its own without the sauce. I have to say neither the sauce or the meat really appealed to me. The brisket was definitely smoky, but that was it. The ribs were dry and a bit bland. The Mac n Cheese was kinda pasty, and the greens were pickled, not what I expected. I took one bite of the corn bread and was done, it was dry and brittle. The mustard based sauce was good and different, but I didn't care for their BBQ sauce at all. It might warrant a second try if I'm ever down that way, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.

First off let me say this. ?I love the food here. ?So you may be asking why I am giving it only two stars, well it's because of their rising prices and small side dishes. I've been coming to this place for almost five years and now my favorite dish (Southern Star) is $10.50. ?$10.50!!!! ?That's ridiculous. ?It seems like everything has been going up in price here. ?Well, that's enough of a deterrent for me. ?The sandwiches have crossed the economic threshold for what me and my friends are willing to pay. My second complaint is the small portions of their sides. ?The mac and cheese side is like $5 and it's not even a cups worth. ?Beans, potato salad, etc. are all served out of a cup you might expect to find ranch dressing in at a diner. ?Not too mention that their pie slices are too small and the rest of the sides (which all look amazing by the way) are way too few in quantity to justify ordering any of them. ?Again, I've been coming here for five years and have never once ordered any of the sides (that didn't come included with my meal) individually. ?It's just a total rip off for what you get. Aside from that, the BBQ itself is amazing. ?The prices and portions are just getting really bad.

After too long in San Francisco without trying out Memphis Minnie's I tired out Memphis Minnie's. Okay, this place can hang. It's mostly makes it on the sides. The mac and cheese is pretty good. And since you order at a counter, and it's a southern classic, they don't get faulted for having mac & cheese on the menu. All you other posers still need up your game. But the potato salad and BBQ sauce are out of this world. I think that's what will drive me back. I hope they offer potato salad in party sizes. The meat is good, far from the "Best. BBQ. Ever!", but good it still good. I had the tri-tip. And if tri-tip surprises you, you'd probably be disappointed. How can they get to 4-stars? The problem is not that it's too expensive ($50 for dinner for two and you order at a counter!), it's that the interior is kind of shit for what you're paying. Some paint, some decent tables and chairs (you know an "enjoyable surrounding") would not be too much to ask for with a $50 dollar meal... P.S....like you have paper towels on the table for napkins. That's fine. How about paper towel HOLDERS?! Just a thought. P.P.S. They also don't have steak knives.

Hipster BBQ to the EXTREME. This place serves up pretty authentic barbecue food for those of us who generally enjoy consuming copious amounts of fat and collecting absurd amounts of cholesterol. The food is very good - I had an excellent brisket sandwich that was on the fatty side, but extremely tasty. The mac and cheese side was the star of the meal....ridiculously cheesy and baked to perfection. I'd come back here for the mac and cheese alone. They serve sake with their BBQ, which is extremely odd but something they've managed to get their clients to catch onto. They also have some very entertaining merchandise to buy. The atmosphere is exclusively douchebag hipster, so if that's not your thing, stay away.....I mean it's not anyone's thing really, but if it means good food, I'll take a chance among them.

Tried the ribs and the brisket. They ran out of tri-tip. Brisket was fine, but could've been a bit less dry. Ribs weren't anything to write home about but I guess I just prefer juicy fall off the bone ribs to the more dry version I had here. Mac and cheese = average Cornbread = average Beans = average Collard greens = sour Sweet tea = pretty good, not too sweet Decor = I had fun contributing to the customer paper towel art Place = hipster Oh yea... it'd be a nice idea to keep some silverware out next time. We were told that all the utensils were being washed and had to share one fork amongst 6 people (just a random comment that did not affect my rating of the food at all).

My wife and I were invited here by friends who were thinking this would be a great caterer for their wedding reception. The idea was for all four of us to pick as many different dishes as possible to see what they would want to serve. This was the best idea anyone has ever had. I recommend getting a combo plate that comes with meat and two sides. Since we all got different dishes and sides we were able to try a ton of food. The fried chicken was some of the best I've ever had. Burnt ends were so good. The cornbread was perfect. But the show-stealer was the mustard greens. I couldn't get over how good they were. Seating is very limited so you have to be patient. Gotta try it. We talked about this place for two weeks after. Worth a trip to the City. And yes, they catered that wedding reception.

Do you want...good ol' southern food....in SF?? ?= 4.7 pts average This is THE place for delicious ribs and bbq roasted chicken. ?::drool:: ?I highly suggest the coleslaw because it is mixed with sweet vinegar and black pepper and not your typical messy mayo (5 pts). ? All this for a decent price! (5 pts) It's a little bit crampy, but this place can manage a group of 6 ppl easily, but I wouldn't recommend going any higher (4 pts). ?But it's definitely a good place to mingle (not too loud) and eat bbq with your friends on a chill night. ?It's a bit messy so I wouldn't recommend going clubbing afterwards. ? The beer selection is not great, but the bbq definitely makes up for it. ?You want beer? ?There are plenty of bars up and down Haight St. ?

Memphis Minnie's is by far the best BBQ in San Francisco. The unassuming joint in the Lower Haight serves up the tastiest brisket, tri-tip, ribs, and other fine BBQ treats in the city. Everything at Memphis Minnie's is slow smoked Southern style--no gas or electric here. All the meats are smoked at least 4 hours (some up to 18 hours) over white oak logs, lending it the authentic taste that Memphis Minnie's is known for. Memphis Minnie's is usually busy all day, which is a testament to how delicious it's smoked meats really are; however, the food comes out hot and fast. They are known for their Slow Cooked Texas Beef Brisket, but the menu also has an assortment of fine dishes if you aren't a fan of traditional brisket. Popular main dishes are the St. Louis Style Pork Ribs, Santa Maria Tri-Tip Steak Plate, Smoked Chicken Plate, and the Two Way Combo (any two meats) for those who can't make decisions. The Smokehouse Sandwiches are also an excellent choice for lunch or dinner for those with a smaller appetite. Memphis Minnie's is plain delicious. The meats are smoked to perfection, the sides are super tasty, and they even have creative desserts like the Smoked Pecan Bacon Brittle. Yum! Next time you are looking for BBQ in the city, hit up Memphis Minnie's and you won't be disappointed.

Feeling carnivorous? Then Memphis Minnie's is the perfect place to get your BBQ on! With a good size menu, plenty of dipping sauces for us sauce fiends, and good service, I am down with this BBQ joint! The staff members were very friendly, gave us some suggestions since it was my first time there, and ended up getting a lot of food for a low price! My husband and I shared a half rack of beef ribs (they ran out of pork), a side of smoked beans, and a cornbread muffin. Yummies galore! They prepared the food and served it to us quickly, then we doused a bunch of their sauces (4 varieties) on our plates and got messy with our meat. The ribs were well made, not dry at all, the muffin was delicious, and the smoked beans were superb. I have never had smoked beans before and after eating these, it won't be my last time! Covered in BBQ sauces of all varieties, we were grateful there was an extra large roll of paper towels on our table. We cleaned up, were thanked for coming in, and I can tell you that we will be back again!

It's tough for me to say how this compares to other BBQ in town, because this is where I keep coming back to. Why? Well, my uncle is pretty obsessed with the place and has become quite the regular. I live 700 miles away and I've eaten here no less than a half dozen times on as many trips to SF, so there's not much chance I'll be trying anywhere else very soon. Some observations: The brisket is almost always very good. Occasionally it's a little dry. Sometimes it's totally sublime. Mostly it's pretty good. The sausage is underrated. Just try it once, and you'll see. The ribs are solid. Not socks-off sexy, but solid. The pie is pretty dang delish. I love pie, but even in a pie town it holds up. Best served after a big BBQ meal. The sauces are fun to have on the table, but don't get carried away. The Texas red sauce is middle of the road, the Carolina vinegar is good in small doses, and the Carolina mustard is divine. I haven't tried the hot hot insane stuff. Why do that to a perfectly good plate of BBQ? The sides are all pretty good. They're constantly evolving and changing. The slaw isn't the creamy kind, which is a nice change. The mac 'n cheese ain't what she used to be now that it's curly curl noodles. The collard greens are the business. You pay for your meal. It ain't the cheapest game in town, so if you're not particular about your smoked meat stacks, you'd probably be best to try somewhere else. Does it redefine the BBQ scene? Nah. But in a town not known for its 'que, they're slinging some good grub that transports a little bit of Memphis across the bridge.

I really liked this place! I did! It has an authentic BBQ feel to it that brought me back to the feeling of being in the Midwest. However,I was dreaming of a pulled chicken sandwich and sweet tea, which I didn't get because they were out of... She said she couldn't serve me the pulled chicken sandwich because they were out of chipotle mayo. Huh? I just want pulled rotisserie chicken on a fancy bun, slathered in BBQ - you can forget the mayo! I settled for the friend chicken sandwich which was voted best chicken sandwich in SF. It was delicious but not what my little tastebuds were craving!

BBQ in San Francisco...there is the real deal, and then there are the imposters. I've been fooled before, but you'd be a fool not to give Memphis Minnie's a try! They've gone hog-wild with the d¨¦cor; literally. It feels out of place in SF, but I love that. But the meat...oh the yummpy meat! There are so many meat choices we ordered two three-way combos. Highlights were the Rib Tips, Tri-Tip, and St. Louis Style Pork Ribs. The side dishes were very disappointing, with the corn bread muffin being the only edible thing in the bunch. But that's not a bad thing because it leaves more room for meat!! So, in summary, this place has got it going on. It's busy as supper-time in the pig-pen, and that can make you wait for the food. But the meats are awesome and well worth your time. That'll do, Memphis Minnie's. That'll do...

When you're ready for a heart attack you need to check out Memphis Minnie's. ?This place rocks! ?The food is delicious and their BBQ flavor is perfection. ?Not for the faint hearted dieters out there. Go and grab some grub. ?I recommend the Minnie's Taster which is 3 pieces of meat and 2 sides of your choice. A great deal for just under $20 and depending on how hungry you are it's great to split.

Normally, I try to avoid restaurants on Haight because of the parking situation but we came here on a weeknight and found a spot right across the street, score! I had the Two Way combo which comes with your choice of two meats and two sides. I chose the brisket, pork ribs, mac & cheese and potato salad. I thought both meats were only okay, a bit on the dry side. I love brisket but theirs wasn't as soft and tender as I was hoping. They also had a bunch of different bbq/mustard/spicy sauces which added an interesting kick to it. Mac n cheese was probably the best part of the meal, can't go wrong with mac n cheese. Seating was a bit hectic because it's self seat only. Once we put in our order at the register, we basically had to make a bee line for the next table that looked like they were wrapping up their meal and awkwardly stand close enough to make it apparent to other customers that the table was claimed and also make it awkward enough for the table eating to encourage them to finish up their meal faster.

best bbq in SF. ?being from texas and mackin on plenty of real brisket, I have not found any true bbq (not grill, duh) in SF... this is it here down to the shiner bock beer. ?I would have rated a 4 as the corn bread wasnt what im used to. ?But with nothing real around and their "crack-like" macaroni... they deserve a 5. ? plus i saw the owner in action... customer service is alive and well here.

I come here often because it is a no brainer... it is quick, easy, and I know I am always in the mood for some good meat. My review is specifically for the beef brisket plate... it is as good as it can get. The reason I am giving it four stars is because the first time I came here, I got tri-tip and it was just average. But oh this beef brisket- flavorful, fatty, juicy, and with the right combination of sauces, so so good. And best part is that two days later, it is still just as delicious. For my two sides I usually get the greens (to balance out the unhealthyness of eating BBQ) and Mac and Cheese. I've tried some of the other sides, but I feel that these two make a very complete BBQ meal and complement everything nicely. FYI-The fries are very thin... not a good potato to fryness ratio if you ask me.

Over the past few years this place has been sliding down hill. as you can see by my 08' review I was a fan. After a series of disappointing meals, my latest order has put me over the top. 1. order at 1PM on a sunday - one hour later I have yet to receive my order so I give them a call. ?I get a seemingly stoned "Austin" oh ya bro, I meant to give you a call. we are out of beef ribs..Pork OK? ?so i am like, well.. you are telling this to me now after an hour and I had to call you? ?so how long will this delivery take I ask? ?15 to 20 min max, we will rush this right over. ok, send the pork.. 2. another hour goes bye, no food. I call back speak with Ben, totally confused as to what Austin is doing... ?food is on the way; next time you order we will give you a discount... sorry for the delay. 3. 45 min later the food arrives; guess what, it is beef ribs, the item that they said they were out of and what delayed my order earlier.. 4. ?Beef ribs seems to be frozen / partially reheated and dry as can be. ?well I guess they thought this was better than the pork. All in all, 3 hrs of food delivery negotiation; ?this was 40 bucks down the drain; I almost feel robbed. So Ben, dont worry about that discount - I won't be coming back.

I went back and forth about how many stars to give it. The number depends on what the measure is. Am I comparing it to all BBQ I've had in my life? To all available in the Bay Area? To my happiness that we have at least one good Q place here? What is that rating about? I decided to give it the highest rating based on my relief that there is one good place here....and because the brisket is actually quite good. I have been to MM's a good 40+ times. I have never ever had anything except the brisket. When I think MM's, I think brisket. They are together in my mind. I don't go to ponder the options, I go because I want brisket. Now. I will drive long distances to try Q. And I don't mean I'd be willing to drive to Burlingame. I mean DISTANCES. Have car, will travel kind of distances. Like most people who post here, I do not think there is any really good barbeque in the Bay Area. There just isn't. But we must roll with the hand dealt. And so we must allow ourselves to sit with both "it's not as good as" and "it's the best we have". It's better than nothing. And so.....brisket is hella good. Fries can be good. The other sides aren't anything beyond basic. I wish beyond wishing that ONE place in the Bay Area would make real BBQ beans. Not chilli. No cumin. I'm talking baked beans with chunks of meat (big chunks), sweet BBQ sauce and a ?baked to a thickness. I've given up on this. And yet, now and then I pray...

A visiting cousin and I stopped in at Memphis Minnie's last night and we both ordered the special, pork tips with two sides and cornbread. The sides were good (I had the greens, which were flavorful and pleasantly vinegary, and the mac & cheese, which were also flavorful) and the cornbread - corn muffins, actually - was quite good. Sweeter than I typically like, myself, but quite tasty with a pleasant bite to the texture. The main event - the pork tips - wasn't as good. They were actually pretty disappointing. Tough and dry, it was clear they were the left-overs from ribs that hadn't been cooked long enough, at too high a temperature (I'm not complaining about the tips being cuts from other, larger cuts, but being as dried out and tough as they were, they shouldn't have been served). Being from Arkansas, I grew up with some pretty darned good barbecue and, sides aside, this just wasn't in the same league. The service was great: friendly, fast, and efficient. Nice beer selection, and the sauces, available at the table, were full of flavor and very enjoyable. But that meat. Man. Really?

I must disagree with a lot of the reviews on Memphis Minnies. Coming from Atlanta, Tennessee, and Texas, which is barbeque at its finest, I struggled to compare this to anything like it. The sauce selection was incredibly weak, the wait was long, and they ran out of chicken. San Francisco is not a city known for its BBQ, and I will continue looking for something better. Greenburger is just down the street and a great option if you are around and open.

Okay, fine I get it. I grew up in California. I'm not accustomed to "real" BBQ. Screw that. This is some of the best BBQ I have ever had in the city. It always fills me up, I'm always excited to scarf it down, and most of all, the service is top notch. I feel SF food scene has forgone the need for quality service. Counter service restaurants are no exception. Memphis Minnie's is the kind of casual place you walk into tand they ask your name not only for your order, but so they can remember it for the next time you come in. They truly want to take care of you. They don't have any kind of elitism or surly manner. They believe in good food and good people. Look around the restaurant at all the swag they have been given, and the drawings people have left. It has such a fun vibe. The Chipotle mayo in kind of insane too.

I had read about the brisket so I got that plate and it was delicious. ?The meat was perfectly prepared and with corn bread and two sides it was a great all around meal. ?As my sides I got the mac and cheese which was awesome and the potato salad which was also very good. The staff was super friendly and they were out the pecan pie when we were there so they gave us a free beer and some samples of their cookie. Great relatively cheap food!

We went on a Sunday afternoon, completely starving. It was full of locals, and really did have a Southern feel to it. Pig knick-knacks, signs, trucker hats, you name it. We ordered the smoked pork ribs with greens and mac n cheese. It definitely hit the spot, very tasty, a little bit dry. Like any good hole in the wall bbq spot, it was a little worn and had sauce here and there on the tables. Getting in the door was a little difficult with my wheelchair. It's hard to wrestle the door and wheel over the bump. An easy fix though! The bathroom was spacious and delightful, complete with cow curtains. Overall, we give it an A-. We'll be going back for sure.

I came here awhile back with my girlfriends after a crazy night out. We wanted real food and one of the girls recommended this place. We were originally going to Squat and Gobble but ended up here instead. Their menu is simple yet yummy. The aroma of BBQ reeks in here in a good way of course. Took me a while to pick what I wanted but I think I ended up with one of the sandwiches that came w/ a side and I chose mac n cheese because it seems to be the side everyone else is getting. Must be good right? It was smaller than I expected, but it was homemade shit. Pretty goood. The sandwich was good. I really can' t remember which sandwich I got, see if it was a really really good sandwich I would of remembered haha. It could of been the pulled pork. But the sauces they have does give the finishing touches. Will want to come back one day to try the ribs perhaps.

Great staff- everyone was friendly and really helpful. Came here for a late lunch on a Saturday; there was plenty of room to sit and eat. We ordered both the spicy pulled chicken sandwich and the beef brisket sandwich. The latter was a little dry, but the mustard dipping sauce and bbq sauce that came with it made the sandwich great. The spicy chicken sandwich was solid- didn't need any sauce - ?perfect on it's own. Also, the portions were just right; one sandwich was enough to get me full and then some. There'll definitely be a next time for me and I'm already thinking about what I want to order (...either the ribs or the pulled pork sandwich) - yum!

Let me tell you a little story about an Ex-girlfriend I had a few years back. ?She was pretty, had a good job, soft spoken. ?Sounds all good right? ?After about a year I discovered she was totally wack-a-doo. ?I saw signs about three months in, but I allowed myself to be blinded, probably partly my own stupidity. Anyways, she was from Memphis... A friend of mine suggested we try Minnie's since it's close to his house and he knows I like barbecue. ?When I even hear the word barbecue I get a smile on my face like the Enzyte man in the commercials. ?Barbecue reminds me that God loves me. ? Ooooh, as I walked in front of Minnie's eatery, it had the look. ?Awww, how cute, a smiling piggy. ?When I came in the employees were super friendly, nice guys. ?It started off on the right foot just like my Ex did.. A little background about me, I'm a beast when it comes to eating animals. ?I don't really have a problem with the process of foie gras (Yea, I said it!) ?I even like veal and suckling pig. ?For those that don't know, that's baby cow and baby pig. ?But I do have a problem when it is cooked wrong and doesn't taste good. ?It's such a sin. ? So while Minnie's had the look and the friendly people working. ?Everything I ate from the beef brisket to the ribs, the mac & cheese and yams. ?It was all just wack-a-doo. ?Oh yea, Minnie's is from Memphis. ? So I'm starting to see a pattern. ?My experiences with Memphis have just been all bad. ?

Scratch fancy smancy food, we came here instead. We ordered mac n cheese, the pork sandwich, and a side of wings. Wings ?reminded the mister of sweet n sour pork, and the sandwich was only at its prime if you drowned it in one of the three sauces available at each table, if not all three.

A BBQ joint thats smug and condescending about their food? I dropped 30 bucks (no exaggeration) for a half rack of ribs, a coke, and a couple bucks in the tip jar. I went to take off and noticed that they only gave me a single little 1.5oz cup of sauce, so I asked for another one ... or nine, preferably. I was then informed by the manager that Minnies is only about the meat - in this case the dry, rubbery, day old pork ribs. Is it so preposterous that one should want barbecue sauce with their barbecue? Also, the smoke is the restaurant is overwhelming. You'll come in for a couple minutes and leave smelling like a campfire. If you want legitimate Northern California BBQ, I'd strongly suggest trying Cedar Hill - or one of the other million or so awesome places to eat in the city.

As a child whose parents killed their own dinner, ordering meat scares me a little. ?I wonder if it had a name, a favorite time of the year, or a little friend named Janney who played with it everyday after school and then came home one afternoon to find it missing and steaks on the table. ? After that, I requested pasta for dinner. ?A lot of pasta. ? That being said... I don't actively seek out meaty meals. ? But, Memphis Minnie's is 'dern good barbeecue' as the white trash folk back home say when quoting jokes used on the teevee by overrated redneck comedians. Sure, the animals that went into my "half pig/ half cow" sandwich might not have grown up on a sunny farm together and befriended a rat named Templeton and a spider named Charlotte, but eating the meat made my tummy and tastebuds happy - and life IS all about me, SO... My friends swear by the Spicy Chicken sandwich, whereas others like ordering the combination plates, because then you get two sides. ?The Mac & Cheese was delicious, the Cornbread wasn't bad, the BBQ French Fries were so tasty I forgot to share, and I didn't try the 'Slaw because that junk scares me. ?Does it raise a red flag if I'm terrified of mayo, but don't mind eating something that used to have a face? $33 for two very big meals, cooked quickly and devoured at little tables covered with glass and giant pourable bottles of BBQ Sauce and Mustard. Oh, and before you judge my family for killing, please remember they didn't shoot animals (or people) for sport. ?Just for food and trespassing.

So far I've been blessed to have indulged in their St. Louis Style Smoked Pork Ribs, Texas Beef Brisket, Rib Tip Plate and my latest victim happened to be the Santa Maria Tri-Tip Steak Sandwich - So Good! Every experience that I've had here at Memphis Minnie's was different but all were positively good. The meats are smoked for hours low and slow and seasoned to perfection. The sauces - Texas Red Sauce, North Carolina Vinegar Sauce, South Carolina Mustard Sauce and my all time favorite the Beelzabob's Breath (stupid hot!). The side dishes - the bomb! I've tried them all... You can eat-in or take it to go and they also cater. And yes for some reason they have imported Sake.

I'd say the ratings on Yelp are about right. Smoked meat for 15 hours? supposed to be at least awesome if not mind-blowing right? um, no. They give you ample servings of meat but the sides are small. I had the beef brisket, the meat itself was tender and moist but it really had me searching for flavor. I thought if I start slathering sauces on it, that would improve the taste. Four sauces were at the table: Texas Red sauce, vinegar, mustard and the "it's stupid hot" sauce. ?The Texas Red was all sugar and I didn't care for the rest. The "it's stupid hot" sauce was too hot for me to handle! plus the consistency of the sauces weren't appealing, it's too thin. On the other hand, the sides were good. Mac n cheese with big tubes of pasta covered with cheese and topped with breadcrumbs and sweet potatoes were chunky and just had the right amount of sugar and cinnamon. The decor is really fun and very kitschy, lots of t-shirts with funnies hanging on the wall and other cute decor line the counter. ?Beer, wine and sake are available for purchase.

Awesome barbecue food! ? Best for 'DRY' BBQ fans; not for wet ribs. Ribs are good, but other items make this place special. Memphis Minnie's has steadily become my favorite restaurant in San Francisco, which is kind of interesting, considering a large number of other quality restaurants in the area. ?While I love all the other restaurants, I end up going to Memphis Minnie's more than any other place, credit to their quality food and fairly reasonable prices. ?I've had BBQ at much cheaper prices, but cheaper alternatives do not come close to the level of Memphis Minnie's. ?They really take their food seriously, and you could see that people here are serious about their work. ?While the restaurant's name suggests they serve Memphis style barbecue, their menu consists of Texas and St. Louis style items. ? Ever since Minnie's became one of my favorite restaurants, I decided to made an effort to try everything on their menu, a goal I still haven't reached, but coming very close. ?Note that not all items are available all the time. ?ALL their dishes are good, but here is the ranking of my favorite items: 1. Pastrami Sandwich (only available on Wednesdays) ($9) 2. Memphis Sweet-Smoked Pork ($12) 3. Texas Beef Brisket ($14) 4. The Minnie's Burger ($8) 5. Texas Big Beef Ribs ($14) 6. St. Louis Style Smoked Pork Ribs ($14) 7. Tri tip steak ($14) 8. Rib tips ($9) 9. Smoked Sausages ($12) 10. Smoked Turkey Breast (may need to go on Fri/Sat/Sun) ($14) 11. Smoked Chicken Plate ($12) Sides: 1. Tart 'n Tangy Slaw 2. Hand cut fries 3. Mac & Cheese 4. Beans 5. Sweet potatoes 6. Potato salad 7. Greens I recommend ordering their two-way ($15) or three-way ($17) to try a variety of their dishes. I first tried this place after it was featured in the show "Check Please --- Bay Area."

SERVICE: ?When I went around 7:00 PM on a Saturday night, the place was packed. ?Seats are on first to order basis, which is fair. ?I was impressed with their service in that the cashier kept track of when I got my seats and signaled to the cook to prepare the food; avoiding the food to cool down while the I still didn't have seats. SYSTEM: ?This is one of those 'order, pay, and pickup your own food when they call your name' kind of place. ?As you enter, cooking area is to the left and tables against the wall on the right. ?Form a line along the left side along the kitchen counter where you could see the menu on the wall. ?The guy taking the order was nice and informative and wasn't disturbed when I was asking questions. ?He informed me that pork ribs, which I thought would be the thing to eat there, was actually the third most popular item on the menu. ?People come here to eat Texas Beef Briskets (smoked 18 hours), followed by Texas beef ribs. ?Pay immediately after ordering, get your drinks, and find a table. ?The cook will call your name when the food is ready. FOOD: ?I really loved their pastrami sandwich. ?It's seasoned perfectly, so you don't need to slap on extra mustard. ?It's a bit different than NYC style pastrami, but Minnie's makes it excellent in their own way. ?I wish they offered it everyday, instead of just on Wednesdays. ?Beef brisket, which was not tough at all, had a very tasty smoked taste even without any sauce. ?All their food comes without sauce with three types of home made sauces available for use on the table. ?The French fries were also very nice. ?Cole slaw wasn't smothered in mayo and had this sweet vinegar taste. ? TIP: ?I saw the cook preparing to smoke their signature dishes, sweet pork and beef brisket, around 7 pm. ?She told me they smoke it until 11 am next day and its best after resting it for about 2 hours. ?Which means you might be able to eat their brisket at their peak around 1pm. ? BURGER: You might wonder why someone would order a burger when their smoked items are so good, but frequent diners at Minnie's know that their burger could be the best burger in the city. ?Don't look for lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, pickles, or mayo; they want you to enjoy the taste of their hand ground meat grilled to perfection. ?Crispy charred outside, juicy inside, needs nothing more than grilled onions and cheese. ?You could add ketchup or BBQ sauce, but you might want to first take a bite and notice existent flavors. ?Toasted baguette keeps the juice inside and makes it a perfect bun for this kind of burger. ? SUMMARY: ?You can keep it under $10/person if you go with sandwiches or go with their platters which are around $14 + tax and drinks. ?This may seem a bit on high side for lunch at a non-full service restaurant, but it's actually a good deal when you consider the quality of food you are getting. ?For dinner, it's certainly a bargain.

Got the Memphis Sweet Pork sandwich with a side of Mac and Cheese. The sandwich was pretty good, the Mac and Cheese, meh. But that's okay, I liked my sandwich with the good selection of BBQ sauces. I wanted to try a ton of appetizers too and wish I had the appetite for it. The only thing I wish the management would do differently is be aggressive. There is a very obviously HUGE sign that says seat yourself first. of course people in line (particularly this one group) sat themselves as the others waited in line (and others were waiting for tables). There's obviously a system and they knew it, but chose to ignore it. A guy tried to talk to them and they were pretty rude and were very matter of factly sitting there. I wish he would have kicked them up and made them wait like the rest of us had to and sat those who had ordered and had actually been waiting.

Oh man, this place does BBQ right. Everything we ordered was just delicious. We ordered: -Texas Beef Briskey (smoked 18 hours!) - $15 -Two Way Combo with pork and beef ribs - $16 They both came with 2 sides so we got the mac and cheese and corn bread. The mac and cheese was SO good!! Too bad they come in tiny little sauce cups - it's okay...portion control! The corn bread is forgettable; was kinda dry and you have to ask for butter if you want it. Note: I made the mistake of asking for a knife for the brisket. The main chef (maybe owner) left the kitchen to come to our table and give me a lengthy lecture on how disappointed he was that I asked for a knife when his brisket is super tender. Damn. Well, at least he knows I won't ever make that mistake again! Haha...all good though..we were joking about it a few minutes later. The desserts looked incredible too: Scratch Pecan Pie, Banana Pudding, Fried Peach Pie. OMG. All slices are $4.95 Seating is a bit tight so plan ahead if you're coming with a large party.

This Saturday, I hit up Memphis Minnie's for their Saturday special: Southern Smoked Fried Chicken. Sweet, smokey with just the right crunch, this has to be some of the best fried chicken I've ever laid my lips upon. Their potato salad is mediocre; their macaroni a bit bland. But this chicken, oh this chicken, is a masterpiece worth every penny; every calorie; every pimple that may surface the next morning. And this was just their fried chicken. This is a BBQ house. I can't wait to make out with their pork ribs.

Although I of course cannot tout Ms Minnie as the best BBQ I've ever had or anything, I do appreciate her opening my eyes to the difference between Memphis BBQ and Texas BBQ - or as the cashier kindly noted as I asked for any sauces on the side: "All of our sauces are on the side. We don't RUIN the meat by slathering it in sauce." Oh, um, thanks. Awesome. My chicken was good - albeit slightly dry - but as I'm not a big 'sauce' gal, I was appreciative of the fact that it had tons of flavor simply from being smoked. Or whatever they do to it for 8 hours... The firecracker fries were also pretty killer. I love me some sodium, and those things had enough to keep me retaining water for a week. Woo woo! Only disappointment was the collard greens. Um, they were sweet. Sweet? Seriously? Someone needs to give these guys a trip to Roscoe's in LA. I'm not a fan of the essence of Miracle Whip in my roughage, unfortunately. All in all, I'd go back. I might not lasso up the horse and cross the plains to get there or anything, but thankfully, the wild wild west of San Francisco isn't too hard to navigate.

OK, now that I've figured out the ordering process (not that it's rocket science or anything), Memphis Minnie's is really growing on me. Every Sunday, I catch NFL action at Danny Coyles there on Haight street, and since DCs doesn't serve food, halftime is all about scavenging for grub in the immediate proximity. Rosemunde takes friggin' forever and the Mexican food place right next door is absolutely atrocious... so a slow-cooked BBQ sandwich is typically the cream that rises to the top. If you like meaty sandwiches, I highly recommend the spicy pulled chicken. On the gringo spice scale, I'd give it a 6 out of 10, which is just about the right heat to get a kick in yer tonsils, but not enough to break out in a sweat. Throw some of that homemade mustard sauce on top, and we have ourselves a real barn burner of a meal! Best of all, the service is lighting quick. Very good for grabbing food to go with only 15 minutes to spare.

I came back to Minnie's for Dining Out for Life, and while my pulled chicken sandwich and potato salad were as delectable as my first visit, my friend said her smoked chicken on the smoked chicken plate was dry, and my friend who ordered the pulled pork sandwich wished there was sauce inside the sandwich. But she loved her sweet iced tea. Even though my buddies experience at Minnie's wasn't as delicious as mine, I'm still leaving the fifth star in memory of the dirty kitchen hipster who complimented me on my ugliest day since my Bat Mitzvah. *********update********* I don't get many compliments anymore. Sure I get a few from the likes of you Yelpers in email form, but actual spoken word compliments? Not so much. I used to get me some compliments. Hella compliments back in college when I didn't have an office ass and the swimming pool in the backyard of my $345 rent home insured a nice golden tan. The compliments could have been caused by the over-intoxication of drunken frat boys, pre-striped shirt era....or I may have been getting these compliments because of the short shorts I loved so much that showed just a hint of ass cheek. Whatever the reason, the compliments were nice. Fast forward 5 years to moving day 2007. Sammy is wearing her holy jeans, a sweatshirt I stole from my best friend (yes, if you become my friend you will no doubt lose a sweatshirt. Stealing them is my thing. Get over it), running shoes, no makeup, my hair in a ratty, thrown together bun, and the giant cystic pimple I've been regularly sporting these days. In other words, I was looking fly. Fly Sammy and her parents decide to take a break from organizing her new, very own apartment, and get some grub. And of course, my wannabe hipster, Marinite parents saw Memphis Minnie's on an episode of Check Please and just haaaaad to go there. Super duper Fly Sammy and parent patrol enter MM's and are enthusiastically greeted by a dirty real, not Marinite, hipster working behind the counter. I smile at him as we make our way to look at the menu. "Hey, you've got a great smile," dirty hipster sweetheart tells me. "I see a lot of smiles, and yours is a great one." "Hehe, wow, thanks," says Sammy the pimple queen who hasn't been complimented since the 90s. We order, sit, and eat. The food is fantastic by the way. My dad, who is known to repeat the same sentence over and over, such as "Wow isn't this picturesque? Look Sam, it's so picturesque" says about 10 times in a row that his brisket sandwich is the best thing he's ever eaten and would definitely come back here. Mac and Cheese is tasty, but kind of watery for my liking. Pulled chicken sandwich is amazing, slaw is tangy and delicious and I think mom liked her ribs. "Hey, did you go to Denver University?" Most beautiful dirty hipster there ever lived asked me. P.S. the sweatshirt I sold says Denver University on it. "Um no, my friend did." Which launched a whole new conversation about where he was from and how he gets excited when he sees people from Colorado, Wyoming, etc. But the man looked at me! He looked at me a few times. And complimented me! He didn't point out my cellulite, no reference to my office ass, steered clear of bringing up my ginormous zit. The man earned his adorable little restaurant five zillion gold stars from Sammy because a compliment can seriously make your day.

5 stars, Stephy. Really? No. Here's the thing. The food here is decent enough, but it really isn't worth 5 stars and definitely not worth over $20.00 for 3 beef ribs and two tiny sides and a beer. The first time I came here, I don't think I had really discovered GOOD BBQ, but after hitting up Texas and even Phillip's in LA, I will say that this is maybe more like a 2.5 or 3 star on a good day. The one highlight to this place though, was some guy who was here last night who walked out and made it a point to say to me, "You are beautiful. I've been checking you out all night and you are beautiful!" Hell yes, I knew I showered yesterday for a reason :)

OK, so just before you go to Memphis Minnie's the next time, I want you to play this video first... http://www.youtube.com/w¡­ ...yes, this is who you're eating. Piglet. The pan-sexual, pre-pubescent, porcine pipsqueak in the pink polyester pullover. With the Carpenters singing their greatest hits in the background. Of course, this is not the only cute piece of pork to be found, as they seem to have all sorts of Piglet-like paraphernalia here. But that's not why you'd come here. You know it's the ribs, and like everyone else, I went for the $13.95 St. Louis Style Smoked Pork Ribs plate with the two sides. They were good, not great. I don't know what those three on "Check Please, Bay Area" were smoking, but I don't think it was the ribs. You get about five, and the meat pulls off the bone like buttah, for sure. I just thought the meat itself - though tasty with the South Carolina honey-mustard sauce - was a bit dried out. Minnie's Macaroni and Cheese was good, stick-to-the-ribs (literally) stuff. It tastes like it's been mixed with some of the honey-mustard sauce, which was a nice, tangy surprise. The only problem was that I just had one of the best mac & cheeses ever at the Brown Sugar Kitchen two days earlier. The Potlikker Greens, however, were a complete miss...way too much vinegar made them virtually inedible. The rib joint options are pretty paltry in this excessively vegan-head city, so one can't afford to be too choosy. There's Lilly's...and Nate's...and why the hell did McDonald's stop making the McRib Sandwich? I give Memphis Minnie's a passing grade, but I definitely need to do more shopping. FOOD - 3 stars...good ribs, but dammit, not great...with mixed sides AMBIANCE - 4 stars...funky with cartoon piggies everywhere to make you aware how cute the animal was before being slaughtered to serve your insatiable needs SERVICE - 3.5 stars...rather jaded, ahhh...the Haight TOTAL - 3 stars...passing grades for a post-mortem Piglet....R.I.P.

~*300th Review!! *~ I'm a Memphis Minnie's fan from back in the day when they were located in the Mission, off 20th and York. Being their neighbor then, the smell of slow cooked meat would come wafting through and lure me in for their BBQ goodness. We ordered the 2-Way with Chicken and Pulled BBQ Pork, Macaroni and Cheese, Baked BBQ Beans and Sweet Corn Bread Muffin, and the Spicy Shredded Chicken Sandwich with BBQ Fries. Yes it all tastes as good as it sounds and looks. I'm a fan of BBQ sauces, drizzling and dipping my meats, accenting my sides and soaking my cornbread in them. My favorites being the Texas Red Sauce and the South Carolina Mustard Sauce. Gave me some inspiration on making my own sauces again this summer. Look out Summer, I'm ready for the FUN!

Confession: I had a THREE-WAY this weekend...and I loved it. A three-way platter from Memphis Minnie's that is :) Let me preface this by saying that over the past decade, I've consumed so much of my father-in-law's delectable soul food cooking that I was frequently disappointed at most soul food joints I tried. Only Oakland's famous Everett & Jones could be considered a worthy competitor. But now, I consider Memphis Minnie's a strong 2nd-place contender. As we waited for our food, we admired past customers' pig drawings, sketched onto napkins and placed under the glass table covers. Sketches varied from a Marilyn Monroe Miss Piggy to pigs smoking weed. But this IS the Haight, so I suppose I'd be concerned if there wasn't at least ONE pot-related drawing. Before I could attempt to sketch my own, our food was ready. My husband and I split a three-way: - Tri tip: I'm on the fence with this one. It was soft, but not juicy. Had they let the meat marinate in the juices and served it straight up, it would have been perfect. - Ribs: Amazeballs. Soft and fell apart in my mouth. I tasted a hint of brown sugar. - BBQ chicken: This was right on. The skin (which had rubbed-in spices) had a bit of crispiness to it, but the chicken inside remained juicy and tender. - Sides: Mac n cheese was creamy and full of flavor. The breadcrumbs added a nice texure. Potato salad was cool and had just the right amount of mayo. - I washed it all down with their refreshing sweet tea. Total bill: $34 They also serve beer, wine and sake in the event you'd like to get wasted on three different types of alcohol. But that's not it. We faced the ultimate Man vs. Food challenge by devouring not one, but TWO amazingly delectable desserts: their creamy banana pudding and sweet potato pie, both of which were worthy of a return trip on their own. And in case you're wondering, (wo)Man won this food challenge.

We tend to watch the Food Network on weekend mornings, mostly because nothing else is on, but also because it helps us decide what to eat that day. Yesterday, after sitting in front of the television drooling at heaping plates of barbecue, we decided to head on down to Memphis Minnie's. Pulled barbecue chicken sandwich was burned on my mind and, magically, it was the first thing I spotted on the menu. I ordered some mac and cheese as my side and a sweet tea to wash it all down. Ben got a barbecue beef brisket sandwich, "delicious," with a side of slaw, "too sweet and vinegary," and also a sweet tea, "good." The chicken was tangy and spicy, flavored with cilantro and hints of Indian spices, making it interesting, unexpected and delicious. It was like having a barbecued chicken tikka masala sandwich and I absolutely loved it. Mac and cheese was rich and super creamy, but lacked that crispy crust which is a requirement to be my perfect mac and cheese. I so want to come here again. PS- This is going in my fried chicken list even though it wasn't fried because it was f**king amazing and deserves the attention.

Nice try San Francisco but I've bellied up at plenty Southern BBQ shacks that boast better cold left overs. Well wait before I bash you folks too hard let me first give a lil respect where respect is due and perhaps an extra star. The overnight smoked ?brisket all by itself, no sauce no nada, is appetizing to a level that city slickers will be impressed. The potato salad was very mustard creamy and the beans had smoked meat mixed in! Nice Job! Unfortunately for this East Texas native those are just the basics that you can find at any old service station in my hometown. 4 Major Malfunctions: 4) Smoke your meat not the customers. WhoTF thought it was OK to put a 6ft tall smoker in this little bitty teenie tiny shack right beside the customers? Every time they opened the door on that bad boy I was nailed with a wall of black smoke. If I wanted black lungs and to smell like a campfire I would have opted to do it myself. 3) Sourdough bread was so tough the roof of my mouth is still sore and missing a layer of skin. I had to dunk my bread in their sauce to soften it enough to rip off a bite. Might be a good choice for kids that need to lose a tooth. 2) BBQ Sauce?? Oh you mean those squirt bottles full of vinegar and runny salad dressing. LOL is this a joke am I getting punked? I managed to mix the runny Texas Red (please rename it) with the spicy one and made some edible sauce. 1) My blessed Shiner Bock was skunky. OK OK maybe it was the distributors fault maybe not either way you're giving us a bad name you sons a....I'm out.

Their sauce reminds me of my ex-boyfriend: I just kept wishing it was thicker. Memphis Minnie's is fine, and that's it. My husband and I shared a pulled pork sandwich and a plate of brisket and sausage links. The brisket was really tasty and fell apart nicely, but was a little dry. The pulled pork was not that flavorful. The links were scrumptious, especially dipped in the mustard sauce, but it's pretty hard to F up links. There are three different sauces to choose from on the table: A red sauce, a vinegar-y sauce, and a mustard sauce. I was partial to the mustard sauce. The vinegar sauce was way too thin to stick to or flavor anything. The sides were tasty, and help this place be a three star instead of a two star establishment. The mac and cheese was my absolute favorite. It was very nutmeg-y. The beans were made with burnt ends and tasted smoky and nice. The fries tasted like fries, but were sort of short and skimpy. The red checkered vinyl tablecloths were a little sticky, but this is, after all, a BBQ joint and everything should be just a little sticky. Well, the sauce wasn't thick enough. The fries weren't long enough. How can a place that serves up so much meat be so unsatisfying? As with my ex-boyfriend, I won't be making the long trip to put this meat in my mouth anytime soon. If I were to ever return, I would try the ribs, and the spicy pulled chicken, both of which looked tasty.

First of all, the food is way overpriced for good BBQ. I might be biased since I've had some of the best BBQ in Texas. $16 for a plate doesn't seem reasonable. For the delicious food and sauces I devoured, I think $10 would be more fair. I like how the place wasn't that crowded and the food comes out relatively quick if you're not getting a sandwich. Get an order of the mac and cheese and some ribs. I'm not the biggest fan of brisket but they're supposedly known for it. The fries weren't that good. I probably wouldn't come back again.

Seeing a BBQ place that serves sake, I thought I had seen it all. Until I walked out and saw the homeless guy pushing a piece of wood down the street with his stomach. ?Then, the board slipped down, hit a crack in the street, and nailed the poor bastard in his twig and berries.

I've had their food when it was catered, and it was always pretty good. Today, I finally walked in there, and it looked like a really fun place. Now my husband wants to find that pig head hat they have. The food was pretty good. I had the sweet pork, with mac and cheese, and a tangy slaw. I really liked them. The sauces could be a bit more thick, but they tasted great. My husband and I split a banana pudding, and that was just bliss in your mouth. Only thing I didn't like was the cornbread muffin, it was kind of dry and gritty. In short, the food was great. On to the service...freaking amazing! The staff were fun, charismatic, and very nice. They checked up on us throughout the meal, asking if we liked everything as well. I'll definately be coming back.

OK - I walked from the Inner Richmond to Memphis Minnie's so I could work on getting my 10,000 steps in so I could not wait for some mac and cheese and fried pies...WELLLLL- I haven't been here for awhile and was disappointed in their mac and cheese. The reason I liked it before was that it was cheesy without it now drowning in cheese sauce...so it is now a "was". And they had no fried peach pies. That was even more disheartening cuz I had walked enough to earn dessert. BUT I still love their brisket...it's very tender down to the fat, if you're into fat...which I have to admit if it's done right, it's doggone good. And it is. And their corn muffins are really good. Love sweet potatoes...they make them really healthy - sweet, a little dry but not drowning in syrup...which means I probably won't get them again. I'm glad to see that they are doing so well as they have a lot of staff behind the counter. ?Hope the next time I'm there that there will be pies.

I recently got over a BBQ phase where I craved BBQ goods for about 3 weeks. Memphis Minnie's is one of my BBQ fixes. I love their Big Beef Bones. I don't know the fatty content, but I know its full of good feelings after and guilt free pleasure during. AND their fried chicken, that is good. The way they fry it the way they do... kills me softly and slowly as I bite into its crunchy exterior that meets the tender juicy center... fried chicken. LOVE IT. The sides, you gotta have sides.

Lots of hype for not so great food. They gave us a free pitcher for my boyfriends birthday though! I may be spoiled, however, getting Carolina BBQ every summer. The rundown: The meat was very fatty and not hot. The sides were probably the best part and they weren't great, in my humble opinion. Mac & cheese, meh. Greens - TOO bitter (and i love my greens). I must give props to any place trying to perfect southern cooking though. Keep trying, Minnies! Hopefully I'll be back with a better experience to share :)

I've heard this place can be hit or miss. ?Unfortunately for me, I went in on a miss day. ?There were three of us getting take out for a bigger group back at Toronado because Rosamunde was closed. ?I got the combo with ribs, tri tip, greens and fries. ?The tri tip was ok but the ribs were dry, dry, dry. ?The greens were too tangy, the fries were fine and the cornbread was also dry. ?

I didn't come to San Francisco for BBQ but man am i glad i found Memphis Minnie's! A friend recommended it and it was phenomenal. I'm a huge BBQ fan, I've been going to the Big Apple BBQ blockparty for 5 years now and Memphis Minnie's had some of the best i've had. A friend and I split the pulled pork and the brisket sandwich and both were great. The pulled pork was cooked perfectly. Tyr it with some of their coleslaw and topped with a mix of the north carolina vinegar and texas red sauce. The brisket was tender and incredibly smokey, definitely the better of the two. I liked that with the red and the hot sauce, which isn't as hot as advertised but still good Definitely worth checking out if you're in the lower haight. swag.

Like the sign says -- bbq is like sex; even when it's bad it's still pretty good -- and granted, that much is true, my high hopes were dashed here yet again by the overly sweet que! Who put the word on the street that that much sugar makes it good? It doesn't and I don't get it. Served sans sauce I dug the smoked chicken which was plenty flavorful and quite tasty with the house mustard sauce which tasted a lot like the honey mustard vinaigrette I make for salads at home. The mac n' cheese was just a'ight and the greens, you guessed it, too damn sweet. Who makes sweet greens?! Has anyone heard of vinegar? Portions were plentiful and the whole thing was just about fifteen bucks, I just wished it hadn't been so, so... sweet!

Oh, pigs. I actually don't care because when you see pictures of pigs in and around a Haight street restaurant, you know it's going to be good. Hence Memphis Minnie's you have pretty awesome BBQ. BBQ style Fries are a must-have. Not joking, there were four of us who ordered plates with 2 sides each and we still managed to obliterate a large order of the Fries appetizer. Shut up, Diet, you can wait until I'm done. I've had better BBQ at another place so I can't give the last star. But customer service is kick ass and helpful, atmosphere is very laid back and the sweet BBQ pork (not ribs) is ironic because it tastes like damn awesome BBQ but feels like a pillow in your mouth. That means it's super soft. Share a plate and do a bit of pre-gaming before barhopping on Haight. It'll be the most productive thing you'll ever do!

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MEMPHIS MINNIE'S!!! *Brisket Sandwich* (FAN-F'ING-TASIC!) .. MY FAVORITE - Get it every time I go with a side of ?sweet potatoe's! The Ribs are reallly good and the pulled pork is melt-in-your-mouth delicious! I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. EVERYTHING is REALLY good... Except I'm not too sure about those brownie bacon bars, those are a little WEIRD for my taste buds. Oh, and mix the Texas Red sauce with the Stupid Hot sauce, just trust me on that one.

California just doesn't know BBQ. I'm sorry, but MM's bbq sauce is sooo weird. ?They have 3 flavors to choose from: a.) red sauce - super thin and sweet?! b.) mustard sauce - yet again too thin and doesn't resemble bbq sauce in the least c.) vinegar sauce - my least fav. Like a salad dressing that goes on the meat? What? Why? I also got to try #14 on the SF Big Eat List - the beef brisket. ?It was ok, but I preferred the chicken. So I basically stuck to the non-bbq-esque mustard sauce. I was so disappointed in this place. I wanted like normal, real bbq yesterday and I obviously didn't get it. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the staff is friendly, and the meat is actually pretty good. I just wish I would've brought my head country (from Oklahoma) that I had in my fridge at home. ? I can't wait to go home and get my bbq fix. Or at least for someone to grill me up some delicious meet and douse it with my good ol' head country.

I came here with two Texas transplants, fully expecting them to find their accents and bag on little California's piddly attempt at BBQ. Then I prepared for the Texas vs. California argument that never came, mostly because we were stuffing our faces the whole time. I'm newish to "real" BBQ, so my dining partners offered some tips. California: (pours some Texas Red BBQ sauce on tasty-looking sandwich and BBQ fries)...My sandwich is dry. Texas: You're doing it wrong. California: ... Texas: It needs to drip. All over your hands. California: Hmm. OK. (Pours. A lot.) ... Perfect. My (perfectly) slow-smoked Texas beef brisket sandwich on a roll (with well-paired fries) had that ideal combo of smoke and good sauce, and was manageable as a large, single meal. I must have used half a bottle of the Texas Red sauce just on my own. Two sandwiches and a pitcher of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale ran around $30. Not bad at all for a good, casual meal in a fun setting oozing with pig-related kitsch and t-shirts from BBQ meccas around the country. They have a roll of paper towels PER table. This is important. Perfect location near bars (Toronado, Mad Dog in the Fog). I can't wait to go back and try out my now-refined BBQ sauce technique. Update 6/08: I tried the banana creme pudding this time, complete with Nilla wafers. Best!

Standing out in the self-consciously Northern California Haight neighborhood like a bagel in a bucket of grits, Memphis Minnie's is the San Francisco place for ?swine Southern style Bar-B-Que dinning. No doubt about it, MM's is the closest thing ?to eating in the volunteer state that doesn't require buying a ticket or working as a roadie for Willie Nielson. If you like Memphis style bar-b-que, everything on the menu is great (seriously, you can not go wrong). If you don't, stick to the burgers, desserts (um, Pecan Pie) or the fried catfish. I personally love their pit-smoked plates. $13 or so buys a ?large serving of smoked meat (pork ribs, brisket, turkey, tri-tip,or chicken, to name a few), a corn muffin ?and two of their excellent sides like pit smoked beans, Deep South Sweet Potatoes, or Tart 'n Tangy slaw. You'll leave full and very likely with enough leftovers to make a nice lunch the next day. ?Expect a tab for two with beer and a split desert to be around $35.00. ?You order and pick up at a counter, so service is quick and there's no pressure to tip 20%. ?No pressure to tip at all, come to think of it. In its singular acknowledgment of San Francisco, MM offers a variety of Sake, together with a good assortment of draft beers available by the glass or pitcher. Personally I don't see "Kuru No Hana" or "Dewa San San" with Canjun Andouille Sausage, but then again, I've never tried it and whoever thought of bringing this bit of the South to San Francisco obviously ?has a flair for successfully mixing the incongruous that shouldn't be lightly dismissed. Parking can be a little tight, but its not too bad - ?its never taken me more than ten minutes to circle for a place right in front or park a few blocks down and walk, and usually much less. ?Pastrami is available on Wednesdays only. In case you were worried, Memphis Minnie's is a country-music free zone.

I am spoiled when it comes to BBQ and I know that this sways my views. ?I honestly believe that my parents make the best pulled pork sandwich this side of the Mississippi. ?My parents happen to be from Mississippi (mom) and Georgia (dad). ?My dad cooks the pork and makes the BBQ sauce. ?My mom makes the coleslaw. ?When you put those three things together it is melt-in-your-mouth delicious BBQ goodness. ?5 stars for my parents' pulled pork sandwiches. Needless to say, every BBQ restaurant seems to fall a bit short in the pulled pork sandwich department. ?Although I recognize Memphis Minnie's effort, my sandwich was just okay. ?I ordered the "Southern Star" which consists of half Texas* brisket and half sweet pork. The meat had good flavor but was a bit dry. I appreciate that they provide three different sauces on the table but none were the sweet BBQ sauce that my sandwich and I craved. The mac and cheese was delicious and my favorite thing. ?The sides are definitely four or five stars worthy. If you decide to eat there like we did, do not mess with their seating system. ?Take a deep breath, get in line, order, tell them how many people you have, and the next appropriately sized table will be yours. * I have had a few "discussions" with my friend Louis M., who lived in Texas for a bit, regarding whether or not Texas is actually part of "the south". ?I asked my mother and she said "well, people in the south don't think so" so I win.

Love the name of the restaurant because Minnie rhymes with Matt's wife name! "Oh Matt, nobody gives a crap!" Ok, Matt cares about this Haight St. Barbeque and Southern food venue. So how come he's only been here a few times? Matt has been here three times to be exact, and all three times it has been on a Wednesday. For the restaurant, every Wednesday is Pastrami Wednesdays. For $8.95, you get a Pastrami sandwich with a choice of sides, and another $1.50 for a fountain soda. ?The Pastrami was tender, but dry. So Matt added their original Texas Red Sauce to moisten the meat and excite the taste buds. Matt chose fries as his sides. The skinny fries were spiced really well and complimented well with the same Texas Sauce. Matt enjoyed the Texas Red Sauce so much that he paid an additional $6.50 for a bottle of his own to take home. Another favorite sauce in his condiment section like the Sriracha Hot-sauce, Tapatio Sauce and Dave's Insanity hot-sauce to name a few. As the coined-phrase goes according to Emeril Lagasse, the Texas Red Sauce would taste great on a sole of a shoe.

I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich and slaw as a side. I know this place specializes in pork and beef meals however, I was with a group and don't eat pork or beef. For the record I LIKE southern food and have had it many times even cooking my own. The presentation was sloppy and the food looked greasy in a bad way. The chicken was way over cooked; rubbery, and the only flavor I could taste was cilantro. Strange? Slaw was a mess and the only thing I could taste was vinegar. Not good. Points for delicious mac-n-cheese and the 4 homemade sauces available on the table. ?Those were quite tasty. Overall, tables/floors were not cleaned and I would not return here. I've had WAY better. Disappointed.

Within the past year I've found my go-to place for fried chicken (The Front Porch), deep dish pizza (Little Star), desserts (Candybar) and mochi (Benkyodo), all thanks to Yelp. I can now gladly add BBQ to that list since I've found Memphis Minnies. My dilemma with Minnies is that I've seen it 1389 times going to Rosamunde across the street, and it's just really hard to give up something you love so much to try something new. Sorry vegetarians, I'm pretty sure the meat is the only thing worth ordering here. Their meat is done really well. The pork ribs are great! Not overloaded with dry rub and not overly fatty. The rib tip was probably my favorite with its smoky flavor and roughly chopped texture. The chunks were tender, soft and pretty lean, good just plain or with a small dash of their homemade red sauce. Lastly, there was the smoked pork which was a little chewier and clearly not as good as the other two meats. The fries are super seasoned and salty and just too much. It left my mouth feeling raw after just a few so I stuck to the mac and cheese that was sort of bland but creamy and sprinkled with bread crumbs. I really liked the cornbread muffin which was sweet and just the right amount chewy. Overall, the sides were pretty lackluster, but I don't mind since I'm a carnivore anyway.

I usually avoid BBQ places because the likelihood of being able to order any dish other cold slaw is pretty darn slim. However, I pulled a horribly funny yet mean prank on a friend of mine so when he said BBQ. I was still laughing but managed to squeeze out a nod. The bbq smelled oh so good in Memphis Minnie's which got me a little excited and upon discovering Memphis had cat fish on the menu I felt a rumbling down south (my stomach, sickos). Ordered the cat fish with cold slaw, fries and corn bread. My Cat fish tender but bland. Corn bread - bad. bad. bad. (I'm a corn bread queen) Fries - nothing out of the extraordinary. Overall pretty disappointing - just stick to Tommy's Joynt if you want good meat. That place smells ten times better.

"I'd even go to a dive bar dressed like this!" This I had to see. I turned around to find out what the Marina-accented little giggly-girl behind me was wearing. She was sitting at one of the few tables that line the wall, opposite the counter that I was ordering from. After keeping a few comments to myself, I noticed all of the kitsch hanging on the walls.....pig kitsch, BBQ kitsch, and Southern kitsch. Pig and pork stuff everywhere, which distracts you as you agonize over the wait for your food. I ordered the sweet pork, brisket, tri-tip, PORK ribs, and sausage. Beans, greens, cole slaw, mac and cheese, and cornbread rounded it out. I'm a sucker for Pecan Pie, so I had to give that a try, also. It was a lot of food to order, but I had never been before and my procrastinating ass may never make it back. I had ordered the food to-go, and was informed that I was getting the last of the styrofoam containers in the store. They hadn't really decided what they would replace them with, but no more styrofoam from then on. That made me feel special. Waiting FOREVER to get my food made me realize that I was not special at all. Once I am on my way with the Big Bag o'BBQ in tow, I follow the Psuedo-Dive-Bar-Scenester-Marina-Girl through the narrow dining room to the street. After another lingering glance at her attire and a few thoughts of what would happen if she ever ran into me at a dive bar, I moved on to go enjoy my meal. When I order food to go, I don't like to have to think too much. Order, carry, eat. It should be that easy. Not so at Memphis Minnie's. They make a brisket and tri-tip that needs to be cut with a knife, but they don't provide you with one. They also substitute BEEF ribs for PORK ribs when you are not looking.....or they can't tell the difference. That was just the beginning. The food is mediocre, at best. I don't know what all the hype is about this place, but the food lacked flavor. All of it. It made me look forward to the pie. Thank God for pie! No need for a knife with pie.....I'll eat pie with my hands, or with my hands tied behind my back, or I'll smear it all over my body and absorb it through osmosis if possible. I'd have sex with pie if I were the only one eating it.....or if interested parties already acknowledge that it's OK for me to fuck the pie. Here's the breakdown: 1 star for atmosphere.....smells great, even if there is pig shit all over the walls. 1 star for the staff.....down to earth and friendly - just a little slow. 1 star for variety.....the menu is amazing - the food, however, is not. In retrospect, I should have invited the Psuedo-Dive-Bar-Scenester-Marina-Girl for a threesome with my pie, but I don't think she's ever been DP'd.....yet.

First of all, thanks to my local friends for taking the guy from Austin to eat BBQ: ?really, folks, I can exist on something more exotic, promise. ?That said, who knew that San Francisco, that culinary taste bud assault that is to be had in this city, there lurked BBQ. ?Anyone who knows BBQ well (or has spent time with BBQ socially..you know how it goes) would tell you that folks tend to be particular regarding which sauce they like, whether they prefer brisket or pork (or chicken or turkey), and to Memphis Minnie's credit, there are plenty of options here, from the sweet to spicier, catering to regional tastes from the Carolinas to Texas and, well, all the way out here to the Bay Area. My brisket (I am, unsurprisingly perhaps, a fan of Texas-style brisket) was a little on the dry side, but the sauce was good enough and it came served on bread that was roughly as thick as the doors of my car. ?I've long noted that any bun thick enough for me to sleep on if I don't finish it is a good thing. But next go round? I'll likely opt for something San Franciscans can claim feels like home...their home.

I read the Yelp reviews. I like good BBQ. This was NOT good BBQ. Perhaps I visited them on a day when things weren't quite right, but I wasn't impressed. When I visit a BBQ joint, I always do the beef brisket and fries. I'm partial to a Texas-style brisket that is flavorful, juicy & served HOT. I entered the place, obviously a newbie. I stood their staring at the menu, trying to figure out how the ordering process worked. And I was being stared at. By the counter person. With a look of 'I hate you, newbie'. So I tried to make conversation when he did not... Me: "Sorry man, I'm new to this place." Dude: "Hm. (akward silence) What would you like? Me: "Umm...Texas Brisket?" Dude: "Side." Me: "Huh?" Dude: "What side do you want?" Me: (looks up for sides on menu) Fries. Dude: "Drink? Coca Cola products? Water? Beer? Wine?" Me: "Soda is fine." Dude: "Your total is blah blah blah, it will be up in a few minutes." (do all service people in Lower Haight act like this? I've noticed it before...) It took about 5 minutes, and my food was ready. The brisket was already cold when I got it! Is that how Minnie's usually serves it? The meat was totally dried out too. Thankfully, their so-so BBQ sauce was readily available & I poured out about half the bottle on my brisket to make up for the lack of awesome in the sandwich. The fries were too salty and were only a touch warmer than the brisket. Because I love ?BBQ, I will come back and give this place another chance, but I was really dissapointed in my first experience. Johnny Cash covering Merle Haggard on the stereo at this place ?merits an immediate two stars.

I see that this place already has so many reviews, but I must also chip in my 5-star rating because this is my most favorite restaurant in the Bay Area. ?Yes, that's the conclusion after living here for one year and a half, after dining at Ritz, Gary Danko, etc. Their rubbed, dry roasted meats are superb! ? I am in tears eating the tri tips and roasted turkey (which is only available on weekends -- WHY??). ? ?Their passion towards sake is cool too, although sake does not really pair well with BBQ. ? What I love about them: 1) I love their meats, especially tri tips and roasted turkey as mentioned. 2) I love their side dishes, especially cole slaw and yams. 3) I love the fact that they have REAL hamburgers. ?Freshly ground on the site, and limited garnish to really make you savor the meat. 4) I love their mascot pig -- swear I will get the T-shirt one day. ? 5) I love their generosity in offering no corkage. 6) I love everyone who works there. ?They are just so nice and humorous.

I don't understand how everything here can be so dry. The brisket was dry, the cornbread muffin was dry. My meal could've soaked up more water than a sheet of Brawny. It makes me wonder if I just had bad timing coming here since there are a lot of really positive reviews of this place. All I can say is that the meal I ate here wasn't anything close to great BBQ. The sauce didn't blow me away either. I'll have to wander in here again at some point and give them another try but I'm not going to rush back.

Let me start with my thoughts on heart health. I know the general consensus is that greasy gooey BBQ is not heart healthy and could actually, maybe, be bad for you? I for one disagree whole hearted (get it...hearted) with this "theory." I feel that the greasier and the gooier the BBQ the better for your body! It lubricates the joints, helps the blood to flow easier through said heart and generally tastes good and feels good going down. So now having educated everyone on proper BBQ health benefits, let's talk about Memphis Minnie's. Fantasy Football draft 2007, my house Sunday August 26. I am responsible for feeding 8 guys that will be in my house talking about football. I naturally think BBQ! I head down to lower Haight and walk in. The gentleman behind the counter asks if he can help me and off we go.... First off, I appreciate that they know how good there food is and that they are still happy to be serving me, not acting like I'm the lucky one for being there. I explain the situation, fantasy football draft, bunch of the fellas at the house, we need to eat. The gentleman behind that counter suggested that a pound per 2-3 people is good, so I say let's do 2 pounds per person. What about sides? "A pint for 2-3 people usually is fine. Will we be doing a pint per person?" "You're god damn right we will!" I finish my order and in ten minutes everything is in a box and they include a stack of plates, napkins and utensils. Items Ordered: Side Pit Smoked Beans- Beans with beef? KILLER! Potlikker Greens-I love me some greens and these were off the hook! Minnie's Macaroni & Cheese- Like mom used to make, very good. Corn Bread- Once again, very very good! The Goods Pork Ribs-PHAT Beef Ribs- Good Memphis Sweet Pork- I wanted rub this all over my naked body it was so good Texas Beef Brisket- Also on the naked the body with it's goodness Smoked Whole Chicken- Fantastic! Sauces: HOT-And this means hot...no f-ing around Mustard- Very good with the pork BBQ- VERY NICE Vinegar- Once again...very nice! All in all, this was a great experience. The service was great for take out, the food tasted incredible and they were fast and helpful. The next day: I now do realize that BBQ may possibly not be so good for the heart. I woke up this morning, gasping for air and holding my chest like Fred Sanford. Was it the BBQ, well, I won't go that far. I also had a few beers to wash said BBQ down, so, I'm not sure it's fair to point fingers. I just thought I should point out, I'm not a doctor and you may want to come up with your own ideas about health.

"GwahnNah!," the guy behind the counter orders you. "Gwanno?" you ask, confused. You look away from him and back at the menu, unable to make up your mind. There's too many delicious BBQ options to choose from. "GwahnNah!," he snaps again. "Gowah-noh?" you ask again. "Look man I don't know what you're saying," you tell him. "GwahnNah!," he says, swinging his arm up to the menu and pointing. "GwahnNah!" "Go on, now?" you venture. "Yeh, GwahnNah! Ordah ahllredeh!" "A southern drawl..." you mutter to yourself, in awe. You've never heard one in real life, and immediately realize it is the most badass way to talk on the planet. "GwahnNah...," you whisper to yourself. "Yes, GwahnNah," you continue, smiling.

Head home, grab a sixer of Budweiser, and turn that TV to Nascar, it's time to be a Southern badass!

"GwahnNah!," you tell the bartender as you thrust your empty shot glass towards her, beckoning for another refill, another shot of whiskey to ease the pain of losing your girlfriend. "I think you've had enough," she says, serving you another shot anyways. "GwahnNah!," you order the police officer who pulls you over for who knows what bullshit reason, wanting him to hurry up whatever the hell he wants to tell you and let you be on your way.

You're pretty sure Southern badasses are exempt from DUIs and this cop is up to no good so you reach for his gun because this is the goddamn South, well South of Market anyways, and you ain't taking no shit from the law, your whiskey soaked brain tells you. ? "GwahnNah!," you bark at the judge, as he's taking too damn long to read your verdict. "Gwahn...Nah...?," you ask sheepishly, as your 260lb cellmate approaches you with a look of lust for fresh meat in his eyes.

Sorry Phil, I just couldn't resist. . . I could hear my arteries screaming at me on my way in the door but I listened to my hangover and pushed ahead. This is BBQ done right and authentic to it's Memphis roots. I did just come into MMs ready for some artery clogging goodness and I'm sure I wasn't disappointed, but arteries are hardly chatty so who can know for sure until it's too late really? ?It took a good 10 minutes of debate to figure out a) what we wanted and b) what we could handle. ?I'm glad we were a bit on the prude side, as sharing just one Minnie's Taster was just fine for the two of us. ?Ribs, pork and brisket - with the most delicious bbq seasoned fries and mediocre mac n' cheese. ?The sauces were good and messy and vinegary and saucy and just like they should be. ?I bow down to the brisket, but I was a bit "take it or leave it" with the rest. ?Next time - brisket and beans. ?Oh yes. ?Not the best bbq I've ever had, but the best I've had lately. ?I even splurged and had root beer. ?Hell yeah bitches - that's when you KNOW I'm goin' crazy. Don't expect a high five if you see your cardiologist inside, but if you're looking for great comfort-laden, authentic Memphis bbq, Minnies is the place for you. ^ /plagarism ^

I wish I had a digital camera. ?There is this great authentic crayon drawing by a little kid with a picture of a cute little pig, a giant equals sign, and some sizzling bacon. ?The pig has a think bubble above his head that says "I'm yummy". Five stars on that alone. The fact that they have some of the most delicious BBQ in the bay is secondary! The "It's Stupid Hot" bbq sauce is awesome too.

The Lower Haight is known for its meat (present company included). Its succulent, juicy, baked, grilled, fried, barbequed meat. Everywhere you turn, someone is offering you a burger, sausage or bacon-loaded pizza. Memphis Minnie's meets the Lower Haight's meat challenge and takes it up a notch by offering some of the most deliciously sauce-smothered carne you can find on this world-famous street. Whether you choose to order an individual item, a meat plate or a combo item, you will be rewarded with an extremely full stomach. I'm a sucker for sausage so I ordered the smoked sausage and got to pick two sides. After consulting with the woman who works at the front, I went with the baked beans (YUM) and the sweet potatas (spelled that way on the sign). There was A LOT of food on my plate and I ate every last drop. (Editor's note: I had an awful stomach virus that week and this was my first full meal so that might contribute to my insatiable appetite). If you like sweet tea, make sure you order it. It almost made me miss living in the south. ALMOST. It can be tough to get a seat here when it's busy. They are quite militant about you not taking a table until you've ordered and I seriously appreciate their diligence in keeping tables in a queue. Minnie: I look forward to meating with you again soon.

not a bad BBQ, though I liked brother in law's better back with the original owners. ?I like my carolina pulled pork and beef brisket thoroughly smoked though... and theirs wasn't. ?but the bbq sauces were good, and overall the food was still good. ?A little on the pricey side, but hey, they were open after Rosamunde closed. I wasn't really there for alcohol, because I was just getting a bite before I went back to the toronado across the street. Good, prompt, ?friendly service, a decent BBQ, and convenient location across from the toronado makes this place a solid 4 stars.

Good barbecue is hard to find in San francisco. ?I've looked high and low, but finally found something decent in the Lower Haight. ? On a sunny Saturday afternoon, we wandered in with slow-cooked meat on our minds and were not disappointed. ?Two of us split the platter that gives you a choice of three meats, two sides and cornbread. The folks at Minnie's are big proponents of Q paired with sake, which sounds great, but I didn't try it. ?I'll give it a shot next time and update the review, but as for this venture, I can assure you that the soda fountain is fully functional and they don't balk at you taking the liberty of freely refilling. The food is served up fast, and there is a trio of house sauces on every table. ?I had the brisket, pork ribs and some other pork dish. ?The brisket took the cake, but the all other meat was nearly as sweet. ?The sides were a mixed bag. ?The mac and cheese was sub par, and the cornbread didn't thrill me, but whatever they do to season those fries is magical. ?Portions are definitely substantial and a good deal for the price. The people behind the counter are friendly and fun, crack jokes and don't get impatient when you stand and stare at the menu board for a half-hour. ?One gent was so friendly in asking if we were done that we thought he wanted our table, but it turns out, he was just offering the clear off the plates for us. I'll be honest: ?this isn't Memphis and this isn't Kansas City, but it is the best BBQ I have found in the city to date.

Some of the most disgusting bbq that I've ever had. - the roasted pork was bland. very soft, but still bland. - chicken was SUPER dry - mac and cheese wasn't even edible - coleslaw tasted like japanese style cucumber salad The only good thing that came from this place is their Southern Style Sweet Iced Tea.

Seasoned fries + pork ribs + beef brisket + "potlikker" greens + mac and cheese + cornbread muffin = waaaay too much food for one person, but so totally worth it! ?The only complaint I had was that my to-go order didn't come with enough BBQ sauce (just one souffle cup!) Granted, I do not know all that much about BBQ, but I do know that the ribs were juicy, fall-off-the-bone tender, the sauce was amazing, and the brisket was super, super tender. ? Of course, I had to eat a salad for lunch the next day ...(I eat guilt salads more often than is probably normal).

I already loved this place, but they impressed me even further today. A couple of weekends ago I went to Memphis Minnie's and I saw their new sign advertising Reubens with Russian sauce. As Pastrami King, I knew I had to check out the new pastrami sandwich at Minnie's. I went today and got a pastrami sandwich on the roll, like I had before, and one of the new Reubens. I was pleasantly surprised, Mr. Bob Cantor stepped up his pastrami game. The new reuben was covered with swiss cheese and a mild saurkraut. The new Russian dressing was smooth and I enjoyed my pastrami on a roll with a side of coleslaw. There are authentic pastrami sandwiches, bastardizations, and oddball good pastrami sandwiches. This falls under the odd ball. The pastrami here doesn't really taste or look like any pastrami I've ever had before, however it's very good and definitely different from their brisket. It has to be smoked, it's brown and falls apart like bbq, yet it has a different "cured" type flavor....it's unique and tasty, putting it in its category of "Smoked BBQ Pastrami". ?It tastes like they use the fattier cut of the stomach like you're supposed to with pastrami vs corned beef...but I have to question Mr. Cantor the next time I see him. Excellent, unique pastrami sandwich only available on Wednesdays. Straight to my list of best pastrami sandwiches in the state!

My work relocated down the street here from the Mission. I'll admit that at first I was pretty bummed about not being able to chomp down on delicious burritos for lunch anymore. But not so bummed now that I've found this place. I was craving some fries and walked past this place. A group of men stood outside eating some food. I glanced at the menu and couldn't help myself... it smelled so darn good! The guy behind the counter talked me into trying their pastrami rueben sandwich. He promised it was the best sandwich in the city so I tried it with a side of fries. That sandwich was tasty. The meat was nice and moist they were generous with the cheese. ?The fries were outstanding. They were crisp and spicy. My main disappointment ended up with really thin watery bbq sauce, however, it was spicy (good). I'm interested to try their mac and cheese and cornbread. ?I also noticed that they had a fried peach pie. Yum? We'll see!

I have three theories: 1) Pabst Blue Ribbon does bad things to my sense of judgment. 2) I really like sake. 3) I have no taste. While the majority of my Friday night drinking / dining companions at Memphis Minnie's came to the conclusion that sake should not be consumed with BBQ, I rather enjoyed it. I thought that the gentle sweetness and smooth character of the sake counterpointed the irony, hearty flavor of their meat. Memphis Minnie's beef brisket is decent, but can't hold a candle to many east bay joints. (Yes, I'll happily take you to someplace with good BBQ. Yes, I'm talking to you.) I tried a few different sides (sweet potatoes, beans, and mac'n'cheese), and none were phenomenal, but all were passable. I'm going to hold a candle of self-respect, and say that I do, in fact, have taste. And I'm not going to blame my enjoyment of this odd pairing on the PBRs I had been drinking earlier, since the following day's out-of-doors activities started with a few pints, and that was a spectacular and well-executed day. So, um, I think I just really like sake. I'll go elsewhere for BBQ, if I have that option.

The wings here are pretty delicious. ?I wish we had gotten only wings though, the ribs were a mistake. ?These weren't so much traditional buffalo wings, they were seasoned with a sweet yet tangy bbq sauce, not the spicy grease that Hooters wings have. ?Different but delightful all the same. I also tried the Sweet Tea here since Evan L. constantly raves about the marvels of this beverage. ?I am a sucker for the sweets so this was right up my alley. ?Cool, sweet and refreshing. ?Plus you get free refills. ?

I've been here twice now - once to stay and eat and once as take-out. ?Both times I had a decent meal but not an excellent one. ?Here's my take on it. ?Once, a long time ago, Memphis Minnie's was the toast of the town... a veritable foodies delight! ?Frankly it is rather hard to get good BBQ meats in SF, so MM must have been a shining beacon of meat-hood! ?But now, alas, the place is coasting on its reputation. ? While the ribs and brisket were tasty, they really should have been better. ?The ribs were too dry and very burnt (I mean charred BLACK). ?I know that smoky wood taste is what people crave, but MM seems to rely too much on the smoky flavor to hide some pretty shabby cuts of meat. ?But, that said, the brisket, while a bit too fatty, was quite tasty. ?Also, the baked beans were very very yummy... I would go back just for them! As mentioned by other reviewers, the place is a mess. ?It's dirty and in great need of a new paint job and just a good top-to-bottom cleaning.

There's a special bond between a person and the restaurant that saves them from starvation. ?In a typical moment of San Francisco naivete, we walked into Suppenkuche at 8:30 on a Friday, hungry as all get-out and thinking we could get seated in a reasonable timeframe. ?Nope, 1-hour wait. ?So now what? ?Well, we were gonna go drinking in Lower Haight anyway, so let's hit up Rosamunde's. ?Uh-oh, that's got a line out the door, and obviously nowhere to sit. ?Hmm. ?So I called my lifeline Random J and he recommends Memphis Minnie's. ?We take a look in: free tables galore! ?What's more, the food was ready in literally 30 seconds. Make no mistake: this is not the be-all-end-all of BBQ. ?In particular, the ribs aren't as moist and tender as they ought to be. ?Fortunately there's a ton of interesting sauces you can pour on them to mitigate this, including a spectacular South Carolina mustard sauce. ?Another complaint is the tantalizingly small portions of sides. ?The mac & cheese and baked beans will definitely leave you hankering for more. It's the beverages that really set this place apart, though. ?First off, you've got the sweet iced tea. ?This was called out in SF mag's Best Of list last month, and it totally earns it. ?Ah, iced tea...my old standby at restaurants, until the day I turned 21. ?Finally a good reason to start drinking it again. ?And then there's the Sake. ?Like most people who walk in here, I thought, "BBQ & Sake?". ?Indeed, they have a board which purports to explain how this works, but it doesn't. ?So...I'll order Sake with BBQ just as soon as someone here actually explains to me why I should. ?I mean, yes, I like irony, but I'm not daft. Overall, I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars. ?I definitely plan to be back, which usually means 5 stars, but there's obvious room for improvement, so 4 stars it is. ?In the meantime I'll roll on out to Johnson's to continue my quest for a suitable SF alternative to Uncle Frank's ridiculously good ribs & brisket down in Mountain View.

Everything I tried was pretty good. ?The brisket, the smoked chicken, the pulled pork, the smoked beans, the fries...all tasty. There are 3 sauces on each table, the Texas Red Sauce, which tasted sweet, the No. or So. Carolina mustard sauce, and some No. or So. Carolina vinegar sauce. ?Fortunately the meats were pretty tasty on their own (smokey and slow cooked), because none of the sauces really did it for me. I also had the fresh sweet tea and the banana pudding with Nilla wafers. ?They were out of the scratched pecan pie so I went with the pudding which was really good -- really sweet -- but good.

Disappointment, I knew not thy depths 'till I tried Memphis Minnie's beef brisket. I'm not being melodramatic! This is SERIOUS. My friend and I made plans to try this bbq with high hopes, empty stomachs and standards which were not met. I'm almost becoming angry just thinking about how many people recommended this joint to me. I shouldn't be angry after bbq! I should be completely unable to feel emotion due to being comatose. The two of us shared the Minnie's Taster (any three meats and two sides for $17.95) with brisket, sausage and chicken with mac & cheese and greens for sides. It was a lot of food. A lot of dry in the chicken and an overdose of vinegar in the greens. The mac & cheese which had been so proudly touted was dry and tasted bland, and the brisket! Oh geez. I really, really love beef brisket. Where was the flavor? Where was the juice? Why did I still feel so empty inside when I'd been eating some of my favorite foods?? I walked out full but feeling hollow. (I told you this was serious.) This must be the kind of place whose weight is carried by name alone. Maybe we went on an off-day, but I probably won't be back.

MMmm... smoked bacon pecan brittle.... never have I ever had something so succulent and surprising. I have an extreme sweet tooth and I think this brittle should be categorized under a new tastebud : baconlicious. The surgeon general should warn that after eating the brittle, possible side effects include addiction, cavities, sugar highs, and extreme cravings. A bit on the pricey side but the friendly staff and kitschy feel go well with the bottomless BBQ sauce that is supplied on the Gingham covered tables. The ribs were great, and I'm a big fan of the mac n cheese.

Here's the thing about Memphis Minnie's: I can't say it's bad food, but I can say that this is not the way I like my BBQ. I don't really care how it's "supposed to be", I know what I like, and I like my ribs to come in a brown paper sack, drenched in hot BBQ sauce, with a side of sliced bread and a grape soda. That's probably why I eat ribs at Brother N' Law's more often than I do at Memphis Minnie's. But, like I said, I can't say that the ribs here are bad, just not my style. MM does have some damn good sandwiches, though. The brisket is a pleaser, in either pork or beef, and on wednesdays, they have a great pastrami sandwich special special. The one thing that is not to be missed at MM, though, is their brunch. SO good. The french toast is ridiculous. The brisket omelet is OMFG. Brisket hash is also damn fine. The salmon croquettes are nice, but kind of over seasoned for my taste. If health were of no consequence, I would eat brunch here as often as possible. UPDATE: They stopped serving brunch! Dammit!

What is out of place here? Good BBQ in SF? WTF? Where did this place come from and why didn't I know about this sooner? Now I have lived in the South and I have had great BBQ all over the country but the one place on the planet where I did not expect to find truly good BBQ is in SF. That said, I went in a skeptic...had the Pulled Pork Sandwich and came out a believer...excellent selection of tasty sauce and the Mac-n-Cheese is fucking delicious (yeah, it was good enough to warrant an F-bomb and I am hard-ass when it comes to Mac-n-Cheese).

This place makes me angry. Eating what is considered award winning BBQ in San Francisco just makes me so angry when I know that in Memphis or frankly anywhere in the south, southwest, midwest and probably even in the northwest this wouldn't even be considered decent BBQ. If you are going to have "dry" BBQ that is unsauce then you sure as hell better makes sure that the meat is super flavourful and tender. I've gone 3 times now and I will not go back from the 4th. I've gotten to try all their meat and found them to just not be that good. then you add the small portions and higher prices. I can only assume that people like the place because it's super clean and run by a white boy. Frankly I'll take some neighborhood joint like the BBQ places on Van Ness or in Soma that aren't all shiny and polished but has tender flavourful meats. A BBQ place should smell like smoked meat, when you leave you should smell like smoked meats. When I picked up my order, my to go container didn't even smell like smoked meats. If anyone tried to serve this food in Tennessee they would be laughed out of town.

I walk into a down home Barbeque joint and I feel like it's Christmas and I'm five. ?So with all the glowing Yelp reviews, I entered Minnies like a shrine. ?I really wanted to like this place. ? I rate BBQ on two things- pork ribs in a nod to the south, and brisket out of respect for the Texan's contribution to the culinary art of 'que. ?I threw in some chicken because we're on the west coast here and we can call any meat BBQ. ?All were decent, none were outstanding. The ribs: ?perfect texture, they were succulent and fall off the bone tender. ?They had been cooked to absolute perfection. ?Unfortunately, they weren't flavored to perfection. ?The taste of the smoke came out nicely, but Minnie's needs to do a better job with their rub. ?It just didn't penetrate the meat enough to tickle my taste buds. The brisket: ?disappointing, especially after reading that Gourment magazine once called this brisket the best in the state. ?The smoke ring (a pink ring just inside the surface area of the meat, it's formed by the smoking process and ?indicates great smoke flavor) was too thin. ?The flavor of the smokiness shone through pretty well and the outer edges were charred nicely, but the brisket meat was dry. ?Brisket is hard to cook well, but Minnie's has a reputation and I don't feel like I should be getting dry meat there. The sauce: ?Like all great BBQ joints- Minnie's serves the sauce on the side to showcase the flavor of the meat and allow you to decide how much to add. ?I added because the bland pork and dry brisket demanded it. ?The traditional sauce was well balanced between the vinegar and the sugar. ?The mustard sauce was the bomb! ?I smeared it on everything, including... The chicken: ?surprisingly my favorite dish here. ?Well cooked, and a great herb-based rub. ? Minnie's was alright but I was surprised that it has garnered such a following. ?I'll come back again to make sure it just wasn't a bad day out in the pit.

I used to live right down the street from this place, and I am insanely sad that I'm not 5 mins away anymore. Minnies is a little piece of bbq heaven. The staff is awesome, the food is incredible. I highly recommend the brisket chili cheese fries. The ribs are to die for, the pull pork sandwich is delicious... honestly I've tried a good portion of their menu and the more I try, the more I fall in love with this place. The restaurant is small, and seat yourself, some see this as a draw back, which I totally understand if you're coming from a ways away... but the food is well worth the trip, and if you have to take it down to a neighboring bar like danny coyles, so be it. Minnie's you have won my heart with your pork fat goodness.

K.I.S. = keeping it simple My Meal Memphis Star = 3 stars Sweet Tea = 4 stars - a bit sweeter than I'd like but still pretty good (it would be perfect with a shot of vodka ;p ) French fries = 4 stars - I really enjoyed the seasoning Friends Meal 3 meat platter = ribs 5 stars, sausage 4 stars, beef slices 3 stars (she really liked the ribs and said she'd come back for more) Mac n Cheese - 2 stars (good but not cheesy enough) Cornbread - 2 (not much to say, it was OK) Coleslaw - 2 (she said it was too sweet) We found metered parking on the street and arrived 15 minutes before the crowd so we were able to get a table. If you're not lucky and come on a busy day you may have to make it a to-go order because there isn't much seating. I may go back and try the fried chicken sandwich and a dessert but I don't have any plans to go back soon. It sucks that I have to spend extra time at the gym for an okay meal.

i'm going to have to piss you off and pull out the annoying "you really can't get good barbeque in San Francisco" in the same tone I give to these big men at my work who don't know how to push this one door open. I push it for them, and in a really crappy tone, say "you just have to push it hard." It's good, but very san francisco-fied. Like in price (obvs), sizes, and ingredients, including hard rolls on their BBQ sandwiches. (??!!) I hate how people are all about declaring what food things are only good in NYC/Europe/run's house. But in this case, we're talking about how superior BBQ is in Texas. Texas! They have nothing! They are embarassed to be there and they do not even know it! So here, you have BBQ. ?Way to go, Texas!

Shall I compare thee to a summer's BBQ? Thou art more tasty and more fucking awesome. If you find me better slaw than Minnie's, I'll give you my left kidney (but not the right one, don't ask for the right one). Especially love their selection of sauces, amazing fries, fabulous pulled spicy chicken sandwiches, kitschy decor, great beans. I'll say the corn bread is good but a little dry. In a city known for farm-raised organically locovorous non-dairy broccoli healthshakes (fair trade, of course), it's nice to pig out on guilt-ridden, sauce-slathered, stick-to-your-arteries BBQ. Mmm, culinary masochism! Go Memphis Minnie's! Actually, I'm going there right now. Peace!

Took a crazy cab ride across town to lower Haight for lunch. ?Walking around I saw all the pretty colors on the Memphis Minnie's sign.and decided to go in. Tiny little restaurant, with a big booth-style seat running alongside the wall and tables sitting in front of it. ?I chose to sit on the booth side. ?You get to choose from 3 BBQ sauces, a gross mustard yellow one, a gross vinegar brown one, or a gross red one. ?I went with the gross red one, called Texas Red Sauce, which makes it seem like a hot sauce, but it's just a regular BBQ sauce. We got a 2 entree plate, which consisted of any two entrees we wanted, a corn muffin and any 2 sides we wanted. ?Chicken, St Louis style ribs, mac&cheese and mac&cheese. The ribs were good. ?The meat was tender and juicy. ?Although it didn't exactly fall off the bone, it easily tore off the bone when I pulled. ?The chicken was dry. ?I was only able to eat it after drowning it in the gross BBQ sauce, which in itself has some texture (not something I enjoy in my sauce). ?The mac&cheese was good. ?It tasted homemade and better quality than my former college budget would allow Kraft box. Worst BBQ I have ever had in my life. ?It's worse than what I thought was the worst (a place in San Diego county). If the food was good we would have gotten more. ?But it wasn't. ?This restaurant should not be fortunate enough to have such high reviews on yelp.

With ALL the hype and best of awards and word of mouf and blah blah blah about Memphis Minnie's I'd go ahead and say that their 3.5 stars is about fitting. Saving myself for a special occasion to try 'the most amazing bbq in the city', Wednesday night came around and my tummy decided this was the time. Bombarded with the scent of delicious simmering sauces I smiled. Quickly did that smile even out at the sight of the board and it's prices. I understand that they import from home and that BBQ is an art but $12-15 for a plate of ?some Southern grub is a bit ridiculous. I settled on the brisket sammy with a side of minnie mac'n'cheese and a drank. The beef was delicious but the portion a bit small. The mac'n'cheese was off the chizarts!! I was thoroughly turned off at the fact that the register guy was trying to sell everyone that walked in the door. Honestly, if you want some chronic Bar-b-que with huge, dripping portions and genuine service with a real smile head on up the street to Da' Pitt BBQ on Divisadero. But you really do have to try Memphis Minnie's just once, tradition.

I. ?Love. ?BBQ. "When I'm happy, I want BBQ. ?When I'm sad, I just want BBQ more." I've done a lot of traveling in the south, so I've had me some good BBQ. ?I love it in every regional derivation, so long as it's cooked with an eye to tradition. ?Anyone who tries to create some modern, 'fusion' BBQ should be roasted alive in his own smoker. ?And yes, there is a difference between grilling something in your backyard (I don't care if you do call it a BBQ) and real smoked BBQ. The boys at Memphis Minnie's know BBQ. ?Everything from the little pigs everywhere to the music (I think they were playing the soundtrack to 'Oh Brother, Where Art Thou' when I was there last) screams BBQ. ?The food was great - we tried ribs, chicken, brisket, all kinds of sides. ?Nothing disappointed. ?The staff was friendly and courteous - southern gentlemen by character, if not by birth. ?Awesome.

I don't know much about Bar-B-Que but I do know good food -- and I didn't find it at Memphis Minnie's. Came here with a herd of boys with everyone ordering a wide variety, like the fried chicken, tri-tip, chicken wings, ribs, rib tips and brisket. With all that meat and testosterone, you'd expect some grunting, lip-smacking and a whole lot of empty plates. Instead, I saw a lot of shrugs and a lot of leftovers. ?Some of it was OK ?-- especially if you slathered it with the mustard sauce -- but most of it wasn't. ?Had a taste of the mac and cheese that was greasy and bland, greens had a weird flavor, yams were sweet and good but the only side worth having more than a bite of are the fries. Oh -- and if you're going to post a sign up that says, "BE NICE OR LEAVE" -- LIVE BY IT! because you should've booted your cashier a long time ago.

We were here 2 years ago, came back again today. ?I had the special pork tip plate, with 2 sides (beans & potato salad), cornbread, and sweet tea. All was very good except the cornbread was inedible - dry, stale, and flavorless. yuck. ?As you read through other reviews, you will find MANY complaints about the cornbread. ?Also they only have "sweet tea" not plain tea, and it is very sweet (too much so for my taste anyway). ?But if you like super-sweet tea, then this is for you. They are really nice, friendly, and helpful here but, just so you know their rules ( I saw this happen today) : ? #1 don't lean on the upper counter or you'll get scolded #2 you can't seat yourself or your guests until AFTER you have ordered food.

Good to see some BBQ in SF. I had the brisket sandwich with a side of mac n cheese and cornbread. Also we ordered a pitcher of Anchor Steam....not bad at all! ?The brisket was very good and so was the pulled pork. ?My favorite aspect was the sauces that are available at the table, so if you like sweet, tangy, mustard or all of them, you can add them to the sandwich! The North Carolina and South Carolina sauces are awesome. The cornbread is also good. I will definitely come back!

Meat. Meat. Meat. What more can you say? Its an extravaganza. I like meat. I used to like the smell of cooking meat. But now that MMBBQ has a new, or needs a new vetilation system, the smell of smoking meat is literally like being smoked myself. My whole block......My building smells constantly of smoking meat. My apartment smells constantly of smoking meat. My hair, my clothes, my friends clothes. Even my clean laundry. Even the laundrymat! Don't those usually smell like fresh laundry? Every day and every night I have to close all my doors and windows so that my eyes stop burning from the smoking meat. It never ends. All this smoking must be why the food is so dry. Is this a restaurant or a jerky factory? I can make my own pulled pork or brisket, or chicken and not burn out the eyes and noses of my entire neighborhood. Or even the neighbors in my building. It really sucks when a business has no respect for the neighborhood its in, and the people that live in it. Memphis Minnies is that sort of place. I gave them one star because I had to. Baaaaad juju

You can take me out of Texas, but you can't take Texas out of me. We are fortunate to have a place like this in San Francisco because it's so un-San Francisco. Stepping into this place, you'd have thought you were back in Hardeeville, South Carolina, or Shreveport, Louisiana, or Rocky Top, Tennessee or Valdosta, Georgia. The place is black and white and red all over with pigs everywhere; flying pigs, caricature pigs, pigs in a blanket, pigs in the smoker, pigs on T-shirts on the wall. The tables are long communal style with the obligatory red and white checkered cloths and paper towel rolls in lieu of napkins. There are three sauces: the North Carolina vinegar sauce, the South Carolina mustard sauce and the Texas red sauce. Guess which one is the best? Try them all and decide for yourself but let's just say there is only one Lone Star state. The beef brisket is what it's all about here. The ribs are OK but they can't compare to the brisket. The sides are all really good and remind me of my grandmother's cooking growing up. That is a huge compliment. The sweet tea brings attics full of fond memories rushing back, and the banana pudding just solidifies a place in my heart (and belly?) for Memphis Minnie's. So yes, this place brings a little slice of my bass-ackwards hicktown in Texas into my life out here in the cultured, vegan, organic world of San Francisco, and for that I am grateful.

The BBQ is just so/so. ?I had the Brisket and it wasn't bad ?but it sure wasn't very good either. ?It was a bit dry, overly smoked and poorly;y trimmed. ?It had a stiff overly cooked texture and was a meager portion for $15. Pass on the brisket if you are eating here, the pulled pork looks like a better bet. ?The baked beans were really a mess. ?The flavor was very nice and the pieces of meat mixed in were good, a little watery but that was ok. What wasn't OK was that the actual beans, they were totally under cooked. ?Hard little balls of under cooked beans are not tasty nor delicious. The coleslaw was good, no mayo just a nice vinegar slaw that was fresh and crispy. ? I may give it another try but I am not in hurry.

Whelp took the fam' down ta Memphis Minnies for some down home Tennessee BBQ. Just like Mom used ta make... OK! ?I grew up in the bay area and if my Mom had made it, it would've been in a loaf form, burnt to a crisp and lacking any discernible flavor except for catsup! ?(I kid Mom ;). ? So anyways, this place has some authentic charm and is in the right location. And anywhere where the guy taking your order asks you to hold on so he can go flip the meat on the grill is alright in my book! ?The staff was friendly and attentive, but don't let that detour you!. Keep in mind that I had my 16 month old daughter along with me when I say that. But let's get to the nitty gritty here... The BBQ. ?On a scale of 1-to-freakin awesome I'd have to give this about a 7. I had the rib tips, sweet pork, beans, sweet potatoes and an Anchor Steam. I also tried the brisket, sausage and mac n cheese. ?I'd have to say out of all that the pork was far and away the best (especially slathered with some Texas red sauce). The sausage was spicy and about what one would expect. The brisket was good, not great. The mac n cheese was actually really good while the beans, sweet potatoes and rib tips fell short for me. Especially the rib tips which I found pretty bland and dry. Overall I was satisfied, yet not blown away by the meal. While I've only had a small portion of what this place has to offer, I'd still have to say I've yet to find that ONE BBQ joint in the city that makes me wish I could move to the South, marry my cousin and spend my days playin the mouth-organ... but I know its out there. ?And my cousins aint git'n any younger!

Memphis Minnies is the Fisherman's Wharf of BBQ. ? I grew up in Arkansas with absentee parents. ?Most of my food growing up was smoked meats prepared by African Americans who know what a pig is supposed to taste like. ?If you want to be authentic, be authentic, don't spend half a gazillion trying to look authentic. ?All that kitsch hanging from the walls, looks like they are a T-shirt shop in Nashville. When you approach a BBQ joint you should smell it several blocks before you get there. ?The smokehouse is your advertisement, the only one you should need. ?The pork will have crispy skin and there will be a black line on the meat where the flesh and smoke have married and absorbed all that yummy goodness. ?You will not find any of that at Disney on the Haight. ?The pork is dry and bland which likely means they have turned up the heat to increase production. ?More heat, less smoke, bad pig. ?BBQ, real good BBQ, is as much art as science. ?It takes time and love. ?And it does not cost twenty bucks for three ounces of bland pork, a spoon of beans, a spoon of collard greens and a beer. ? Good Q ought to stand up by itself, the sauce is a condiment, not the main event. ?Mix enough of the Minnie's sauce with your meat and you will get something like a pork flavored cole slaw. Oh, I liked the greens. ?On the other hand, it is damn near impossible to screw up a pot of greens.

Officially my new favorite place to eat in the city. Memphis Minnie's has the fastest service I have ever seen in my life - and the food's tasty too. My BBQ pork sandwich was great slathered with red sauce, and the mac 'n cheese was a great side. The corn muffins were so delicious that I wish I'd ordered another one. Plus, they have Stella Artois on tap - they clearly know the way to my heart. Memphis Minnie's displays numerous awards on its walls from over the years, and it's easy to see why. Quick service, cool atmosphere, and some of the best food you'll find in the city. I'll be back for sure.

Went here on Sat 1/6/07 but I had a cold so couldn't taste my food all that well. We decided to eat here from Fremont cuz of lots of good reviews I've read before and Check Please which re-aired again. Parking is pretty hard in SF, we didn't find the restaurant first so we ended up parking like 8 blocks further then planned, oh well. Was meeting up with a friend, but since I was getting hungry decided we should get the table first. ?That's not how it's done. ?You have to order the food first, then when a table opens up they let you have it. ?You gotta wait for your order when they shout out your name. ?Communal sharing of a table is in order since it's a small place. Food we tried: corn muffin-gritty .75. wish it came w/ butter Southern Star 1/2 Texas brisket & half Memphis sweet pork sandwich w/ a side of mac & cheese $8.25-pretty good, though I used lots of Texas Red Sauce to drown my sandwich. ?Mac & cheese-runny, just ok. scatch pecan pie $3.95-pretty good sweet ice tea $1.75-just like drinking sugar water, no tea taste at all. Food was ok, but it could be due to my cold. ?Might give it another chance one day, not in a hurry. Time visited: 1

4th of July means BBQ right? Appropriately, this is where my friends and I decided to stop by on the 4th. It's a rather small place, with 8 or so tables lined with heavy plastic (in anticipation of messy BBQ eatage), with fun little drawings underneath that customers leave behind. So you get in line, all the while taking in the delicious scent of BBQ, and by the time its your turn to order, you want to eat EVERYTHING. Which is exactly what I did. I ordered the "Minnie's Taster", which is THREE meats and 2 sides. I was super sad they were out of beef ribs, so I got pork ribs, brisket, and the Andouille sausage, along with fries and baked beans. I had really high expectations, and some of what I ate delivered. The brisket was deliciously fatty, and fell right apart on the plate. The sausage was also really delicious, flavorful, and spicy. The fries were OK, kinda like the cajun fries at Five Guys, but not as good. The ribs though, were quite bland, and didn't taste like much of anything except meat (and tough meat at that). Gotta give an extra star though for the service. The guy at the register, Steven, had his staff in order, even reprimanding one of the guys while we were ordering for being lazy. When I finished my meal and went up to tip him, he actually remembered my name! And the bus boys who also prepped the tables for us were very accommodating and helpful. Even if the food wasn't the best, it was good enough, and I'd totally go back for the great dining experience.

I was really disappointed after trying Memphis Minnie's. Because of my deep rooted love for BBQ, I was excited to meet another potential candidate worthy of going on my personal BBQ hit list. ?I even put on my best pair of eating pants in preparation. Even though a plus for Memphis is that there is actually a restaurant where you can sit down and eat (versus other places like Gorilla BBQ and Smokin' Warehouse that don't have seating), the food was just so subpar that I don't think I will go back. The brisket was okay but a bit dry and made BBQ sauce a must. ?The mac n' cheese was also just okay and it came out a bit cold. ?Collard greens were yuck and mush and the cornbread did not meet expectations. Sorry Memphis Minnie's, maybe some other not-so-crazy about BBQ foodies will come your way and appreciate you for your "cool" interior and fancy sauces but I am not one of them. ?This is where I could slip in the line "it's me, not you"... but no, it's really you.

On a lazy Sunday, my boyfriend and I were trying to figure out what to eat for dinner. "BBQ sounds SO good right now", he said. One place immediately came to mind, and thankfully for us, it's close by - Memphis Minnie's. I had the Memphis sweet smoked pork, it was good but definitely needed 'something'. I wish it was a pulled pork sandwich, but overall it was good. I liked the BBQ sauce that it came with, the mustard sauce not so much. I got a side of potato salad and I really enjoyed that. My boyfriend got the smoked pork ribs and he absolutely devoured it - meaning it was pretty delicious! He had the coleslaw for his side, and he said it was okay. After all this food, of course we had to end it with dessert. After a lot of back and forth between getting the pecan pie or the fried peach pie, we went with the pecan. It was amazingly delicious. It was sweet and literally melted in your mouth, the crust was crispy and crumbly. Add the whip cream, you won't be disappointed! Overall, I enjoyed my meal and would go back to Memphis Minnie's, but I've had better.

I have been craving Memphis Minnie's for awhile now even though I have never tried until recently. ?So I don't know what conjured up the mouth watering, tummy growling cravings to eat at Minnie's. ?I have just heard so much good word of mouth about this place that I had to have myself a piece of their bbq. Pork ribs were fall off the bone good. ?Mix the Texas Red and Mustard sauce for a perfect combo, but the sauces on their own are not to my liking. ?The brisket disappointed. ?I think it was an off day for them because it was really dry. ?It had a good crust on there, but unfortunately it might have been sitting in the spit for too long because it was charred dry. ?Like eating jerkey. ? The corn muffins I actually liked, although dry. ?I really like their mealy, grainy texture. ?A slather of butter helped moisten up the courseness. ?Now the sides... poopah! ?I like my sweet potatoes mushy and even mashed with brown sugar. ?Seems like they bake/steam? it just until it isn't raw. ?Vinegar slaw... meh... different, but didn't care for the peppers. There are some places so knock your socks off good, you crave it again and again. ?Ironically, even tho I craved this even before my first visit, I don't see myself craving it any longer. ?The sandwiches and catfish catches my interest, but I don't see myself getting the latenight munchies and wanting to gorge myself on Minnie's 'que.

My friends and I were crashing an ex-co-worker's birthday Potluck BBQ on Haight so we decided to stop by Memphis Minnie's to pick up some stuff before heading out to the party. ?We got a pint of potato salad ($5.00), a pint of mac n' cheese ($6), half a dozen of smoky mountain wings ($5.75), and six corn bread muffins ($.75 each). ? I really liked the potato salad, it didn't taste like mayonnaise at all like others I've tried before. ?Using red potatoes is definitely a plus. ?The mac 'n cheese was a bit dry and overcooked, but it tasted good. ?Smoky mountain wings are do die for... made me want to eat chicken again and think about why I ever gave up chicken in the first place -- the sauce is just so delicious, crispy on the outside and the meat is tender that it just falls off the bone. ?Yum! ?The corn bread muffins are really good, too -- perfect texture, light, but not crumbly. Everyone at the party loved the food we brought and it didn't take long for it to be all eaten up :-)! We decided to leave the party a couple of hours later, grabbed some smokes and started craving for chili. ?Since we were parked right next to Memphis Minnie's, we went back in and got some chili... Texas Chili to be exact. ?I was disappointed, just not what I was expecting to get. ?The chili was all meat... yes, meat and no beans. ?I really wanted some beans... would have happy if there were beans. ?Oh well, at least it was still tasty and my friends seem to have enjoyed theirs. ? Great BBQ place. ?Two beers (Sierra Navada and Anchor Steam) on tap, fun atmosphere, cool people. ?They also have merchandise for sale; shirts, hats, and sauces :-)!

Hail to the Pig! Don't worry, it's not meant as an insult to our President. Memphis Minnie's truly idolizes the pig. There are pig-themed wall signs, pig-inspired napkin drawings and pig-adorned t-shirts on the walls. In other words, it's a perfect place to pig out. My first couple of minutes at this place were pretty awkward. Here's the conversation I had with the cashier right off the bat: Memphis Minnie's Cashier: "Welcome! Are you still deciding? You should definitely get some of our country fried chicken. It's so good, it comes with its own prescription for Lipitor." Me: "Well, I already take Lipitor, so I won't be needing that." Cashier: [awkward silence] Since I didn't come to this place to lower my cholesterol level, I decided to go all out. I went for the two-way platter with brisket and pulled pork. Reasonably priced at $15.95, the platter comes with two sides (mac 'n' cheese and sweet potatoes, please) and a cornbread muffin. I complemented the meal with a glass of Diet Coke from the fountain, paid $19.60 all told, grabbed some silverware and sat down. The place is really small. We were here at 4 pm, and the place was empty. I bet the lines get pretty long here during the dinner rush. There are about 12 tables in the whole establishment, so they ask that you not "save" a table until you order your food. The tables are covered with checkered tablecloths, which, in turn, are covered with plastic protectors (similar to the ones you might find protecting your grandma's couch). I thoroughly enjoyed looking at the customer pig drawings on the napkins displayed under the plastic protector. If I could draw, I would, too, try to get my napkin on display. It didn't take long for them to call my name to come to the counter and get my food. I got four thick slices of brisket and a decent sized serving of pulled pork. Next to the meat there were two tiny cups with the sides I ordered. The sides were embarrassingly small. Even my cornbread muffin (DEEEEEElicious, by the way) was laughing at those tiny cups. The brisket and the pulled pork were a little dry, but it was nothing a little BBQ sauce couldn't fix. There were 4 kinds of sauce on the table: vinegar sauce, mustard sauce, regular BBQ sauce and extra hot sauce. The last two were very good. My mac 'n' cheese had a weird flavor, and my sweet potatoes could have used some spice. Bland sweet potatoes are not the best thing in the world. Maybe the small sides were a blessing in disguise. My friend ordered a brisket sandwich, and he seemed to enjoy it. Memphis Minnie's might just be the best BBQ in San Francisco, but I am still looking for the real Southern BBQ place with real Southern portions and real Southern flavor. Business opportunity, anyone?

In a word: unimpressed. Everyone within a 30 mile radius talked this place up like it was the 2nd coming of BBQ. It is not. I thoroughly enjoy the fact that a large majority of people who give Minnie's a five star rating qualify their rating by claiming they lived in Texas for ___ years. Fine, you may have lived in Texas but you have the taste buds of a Canadian if you think this is great/amazing/stellar/awesome/ (insert hyperbolic adjective of choice) BBQ. I ordered the Memphis sweet pork sandwich this Tuesday. Coincidentally, my feelings toward the sandwich were quite similar to my feelings for the day. Thank god it wasn't Monday, but it was a far cry from Friday. The sauces were good (particularly the sweet mustard) - but they can't make up for a half-assed sandwich. I will note that I did love the side of macaroni and cheese. However, for my $12.00 meal, I would've greatly appreciated more than a thimble full. I would bet that even those Texans handing out 5 star ratings like hot cakes would agree that sides are not meant to come in containers more akin to a shot glass than anything else. (Unless, of course, you ordered a side of tequila). In my mind, the biggest knock against Minnie's is not it's food - because it's not bad, it's just not great - it's the failure to meet expectations. A ton of San Franciscan's claim this place is excellent and unfortunately, they're all wrong.

Usually, when I barbecue, I use this thing called FIRE. ?Don't know if y'all have heard of this stuff...basically, it cooks things and makes things HOT. ? Apparently, the folks at Minnie's have not discover the wonders of the flame. ?My girlfriend and I got the pulled pork (I got the platter, and she got the sandwich). ?There was a heaping pile of meat, and I put some of the red sauce on it, stuck my fork in and took a bite. ?COLD!!! ?Not lukewarm...COLD! ?I thought it was the sauce, but i took a naked bite and it was still cold. ?My mac and cheese was cold, and my gf's fries were probably out since lunch! ?NASTY! I like my barbecue, well, barbecued! ?I LOVE BBQ! ?I felt duped! ?I couldn't wait to write my scathing review! ?We left Minnie's and as we were going home, this review began to take form in my mind... I was planning on giving it 2 stars, because I did like the red sauce. ?I decided to sleep on it. Then.... At 4am... I woke up in a horrible sweat from a nightmare...It was like the scene from "Alien" where the alien thing bursts from that dude's stomach...horrendous! ?Then I realized that it wasn't a dream at all...it was Minnie's Revenge....

Porkgasm. Full disclosure: ?I've never spent more than a two-hour layover in the South, I'm not a barbecue purist, and I don't know (or want to know) where the hock comes from. ? For a long time, Memphis Minnie's was my Sunday hangover destination. ?Luckily I only discovered after I moved out of the neighborhood that it was just as good outside of the context of a debilitating case of the shakes. ?Everything that I've tried there has been the 'best thing ever,' including the 'low country grits,' which I probably should've regretted ordering later (it appears to be a artery-reinforcing combination of gravy, fry, corn and shrimp). ?Winners include: pulled pork sandwich, brisket and cornbread. They also claim to have an extensive sake menu -- how's that for authenticity? As the sign above the door says, "fat is flavor."

Memphis Minnie's gets two thumbs up in my book for consistently good food. ?I've been eating here for years and I have never had a bad meal from this restaurant. ?In fact, every meal I've ever had from Memphis Minnie's has been exactly the same. ?I like that. ?The chicken literally melts in your mouth and the tri-tip - while not quite meeting Santa Maria style standards, to which this Californio can confidentially attest (granted, no BBQ joint in SF can really hope to replicate what you can only really get in the dusty parking lots of Central California) - is pretty damned good. ?If they offered fine, crusty French bread, liberally soaked in fresh creamery butter and then grilled, and some lovely pink beans, they might make it half way there. ?Alas, this is essentially a Carolina style BBQ place and mimicking the fine culinary traditions of Calfiornia ain't their priority. ? I will note, however, that their sauces, once thin and vinegary in that Eastern Carolina style, have thickened up quite a lot over the years. ?People in the west like their thick, sweet, tomatoey sauces and I guess the Memphis Minnie's management has heard the cry. ?Too bad. ? ? ? The mac and cheese is hands down the best in San Francisco. ?Period. ?Seriously, do not argue with me about this or I will beat you dead. ?The cheese sauce is liberally spiked with nutmeg and the casserole topped with crumbled corn bread. ?Unbelievable. ?So unbelievable that I've attempted to reconstruct it in my own spacious kitchens to mixed degrees of success. ?In fact, I'm so in love with the mac and cheese that I should prolly marry it. ?I would be perfectly happy forgoing the meat and ordering a pint of mac and cheese and calling it a night. ?Delicious! ? The only drawback to Memphis Minnie's, is the price. ?For BBQ, this place is astronomically expensive. ?Also, I am concerned that the delivery hipsters aren't getting my tips. ?The one who dropped off my most recent meal was very engaging, friendly, and hesitated to get back on their fixie just-so-much as to indicate that perhaps they were waiting for a fistful of gratuity in the form of American dollars. ?Since I chucked out a 20% tip on GrubHub when I placed my order, this left me a bit perturbed. ? ?I certainly hope they got their tip. ?If not, they got the reward of plenty of fresh air and exercise - a rip off in my book!

Memphis Minnie's: delicious BBQ food and a fun laid back atmosphere. The food is ordered quasi-cafeteria style, which I always like at BBQ places. Good selection of meats, sides, and desserts. The staff is very nice and crowd is chill. The wait for food, however, is looooong. I'd advise not going there if you are extremely hungry and need to eat asap. But do go if you want to enjoy a few beers while you wait for a meal of delicious meaty food.

Yeah, dunno. I suppose the BBQ is decent but for some reason I've never found it altogether that great. Before you slather on the sauce, the meat usually seems pretty dry to me and I have tried going a couple of times. I do like the fact that they have 3 (4?) different sauces with varied different tastes like North Carolina spicy mustard, Texas whatchamacallit, etc. etc. so if you want to go for a unique sauce, it's a nice change of pace. I've found the tables are usually dirty, not wiped off and thus sticky 50-60% of the time. I won't stop going there entirely because sometimes I need a BBQ fix after 8pm or on a Sunday when none of the other places I like are open.

BBQ. ?Best I've found in the city, and I've looked. Oh ... you want more info than that ... ok Get the beans. ?Firm beans in flavorful sauce with chunks of bacon, not a mushy mess. ?Exceptionally good. I think their standout meat items are the sliced varieties, the tri-tip and brisket. ?I'm betting it has to do with that nifty black oven-smoker-giant iron thing in the front of the joint. ?Great flavor with out without sauce, though they do serve a selection of sauces - 2 types of red sauce, a mustard sauce, and a spicy sauce. ?All are good. Downside - call ahead. ?They do run out of things, and occasionally don't open random days. ?Parking is always fun.

This place has the best BBQ in the Bay Area. ?The only other contender is Everett & Jones in Oakland, but this is just a little but better. ? The people that have given in bad reviews are suspect. ?One lady said that she "doesn't like BBQ." ?Another said she "did not like the smokey taste in her mouth." ?(That is kind of the point of BBQ.) ?Others have said that certain meats were a little dry, that is why you add the sauce to your taste. ?This BBQ tastes a lot like BBQ from Texas to North Carolina, although admittedly not quite as good as the best from where the cuisine was invented. ? Very good. ?And their sauces and banana pudding are very good too.

I love me some Q! I've been having a hard time finding a good joint to get my Q on, and so far, Memphis Minnie's has been the best. ? The BF took me to Nate's last week, raving about how great it was, and I really wasn't impressed. ?I remember eating at MM's a couple of years back and enjoying it, so thought it was time to give it a shot again. We shared the ginormous three meat platter that came with 2 sides, your choice of meats and some cornbread. ?The BF chose the tri tip, rib tips and pork ribs for the meat and mac and cheese and fries for the sides. The meat was just the way I like it - tender, juicy and with the smoke house flavor I like (unlike Nate's). ?The platter was heaped over with meat, there was no skimping here! ?The tables have three different house sauces available, and the counter up front has a bottle of hot and spicy "Beelzebub" sauce...I tried them all and it was hard to pick a favorite (if I had to, it probably would have been the mustard sauce). The sides were okay. ?We had the mac and cheese and the fries. ?The mac and cheese was tasty, but not was "cheesy" as I usually like it. ?The seasoned fries were tasty, but at times the seasoning became quite overwhelming. Cool decor, and the owner was there working away. ?The folks behind the counter are actually nice and the service is super fast. ? If you want to get your Q on, this is the joint to hit up!

Well, I finally got a chance to enjoy a "real" meal from this place, and it was pretty solid. It didn't blow me away like I thought it would (not enough to get that fifth star), but it was still very good. I decided to grab dinner here on a Friday after the gym. It wasn't that crowded (I've driven by this place when the line was literally out the door) and they were quick with my order. I decided to go the two-meat combo, which came with two sides. Now I love ribs & brisket as much as the next person, but I decided to go with the sweet pork (which I had before and knew was good) as well as the chicken. Both were excellent. I know that when it comes to BBQ, a lot of people disregard chicken (to some people it might as well be a "vegetarian" option), but I love BBQ chicken. The two sides I decided to go with were the seasoned fries and coleslaw (again, I know these aren't the most "BBQ-like" options when you also have sweet potatoes, mac & cheese, and greens to choose from, but they sounded good at the time). The fries were a little soggy, but did have good taste. I LOVED the coleslaw! It was tangy (vinegar, not mayonnaise based) and was crisp, with peppers and tomato. The meal also came with a corn muffin, which I thought was eh... The quality of the food was good, and when I eat BBQ I expect to pay more than I would with other kinds of food, but for about $17.50 (with tax) I didn't think the portions were great (certainly no leftovers for this hungry boy). I'll definitely be back, because the food is good, but it didn't "wow" me necessarily like I thought it would.

After a night of running around the wild streets of San Francisco, wandering from bar to bar, it was time to soak up some of the booze with some delicious southern style BBQ! The place was covered with t-shirts from other BBQ restaurants from around the states, which makes for an interesting read while in an altered state of mind. I devoured the BBQ Pork sandwich, which really hit the spot. I used their hot sauce which, when combined with the sweet BBQ, makes for some amazing bursts of flavor. Next time I'm taking on the ribs! Great for a late night 4th meal or a satisfying lunch.

spent a standard dinner at the HOME OF SWINE DINING last night! i wasn't expecting that this bbq joint can get really busy on a tuesday night and to find a table is not that easy, for most of it was taken. Luckily, we got this corner spot by the door to feast upon a plate of: PULLED SPICY CHICKEN SANDWICH with a side of BBQ SEASONED HAND-CUT F/F and a ST. LOUIS SMOKED PORK RIBS with POTATO SALAD, BEANS & CORN MUFFIN. i would say that the sandwich was satisfactory, i really liked the sauce they used and the chicken were tender. the smoked pork was average, potato salad was also ok, as well as the beans. the corn muffin was good. the f/f was excellent, that i finished the whole portion of it!!! the three big plastic bottles of their very own VINEGAR, MUSTARD and BBQ SAUCE was watery!...the consistency was thin!! not a good thing for a place known for their smoked, brisket items. it was really dissapointing. however, i found the varieties of PIGS/PIGLETS figurines showcased in the middle counter between the cash register and prep-table quite cute and attractive. also, they serve bottomless soda, which you help yourself in their soda fountain located at the back.

Last night I checked off another thing on the Big Eat SF list: #14. ?Beef brisket at Memphis Minnie's. I have to say, it wasn't as great as I expected. ?All my brisket experiences from now on are compared to some brisket a co-worker brought in from Texas, and Memphis Minnie's didn't measure up. ?Yes, it was tender, but it wasn't juicy and flavorful like the Texas brisket. I also had the Andouille sausage which was decent. ?My hubby had the rib tips, and they were very disappointing. ?They were dry and seemed to be overcooked. ?None of the three sauces were able to save them. The best meat by far out of all four that we tried was the pulled pork. ?It was very tender and tasty. ?Especially good with the vinegar sauce. I had the mac 'n cheese and the beans on the side. ?The mac 'n cheese was okay, drier than I prefer mine (I like mine super cheesy). ?I also prefer baked beans to be a little bit sweet, but their version is a little bit spicy-ish. All in all, our meal was pretty good. ?I'd like to go back and try their desserts. ?Oh, they don't have high chairs, so we had to juggle our little one on our laps and pass her back and forth to try and eat our food AND feed her. ?Just an FYI.

OK. So back in November my sister rode the BART over from SF & pays me a visit... with wonderful gifts... A bottle of "South Carolina Mustard Sauce" and a bottle of delectable, sweet, smokey, burn-your-mouth-Habanero-laced BBQ sauce called "BeezleBob's Breath", described on the label as "Stupid Hot". She tells me she got these sauces from a "bomb-ass BBQ spot in the Lower Haight called Memphis Minnies". She visited again in December and brought the "North Carolina Vinegar Sauce" from this fine establishment... Although all 3 of these sauces are outstanding, being a "Food Pyro" (I love spicy sh*t) I used the "BBB" sauce on everything. Pork ribs, beef ribs, chicken, bacon & eggs, sandwiches... I think the kicker was during Christmas, when I marinated a top sirloin roast in it. Even though that roast was one of the last entrees out of the oven, it was the first one gone... with several victims perspiring and asking for more at the same time. So this past weekend I finally paid a visit to the source of this infamous sauce. Needless to say, the food was DELICIOUS. I had the "taster", where you can order your choice of 3 meats. I opted for the Brisket, Memphis sweet smoked Pork (pulled pork) and Rib tips. I initially ordered the Tri-Tip, but at the last minute changed it up to the rib tips. For my side dishes, I got the Mac & cheese and the potato salad. It also comes with a corn bread muffin. Both the Brisket and smoked pork were ridiculously tender... the rib tips - not so much. They weren't horrible, but lets just say I should've stuck with the Tri-Tip. My wife found a new friend in their "Texas Red sauce", which she doused her Pulled Pork Sandwich with. (we bought a bottle to take home) The potato salad was a perfect texture, with a little tangyness to it = delicious. The mac & cheese was creamy, cheesy and mmm, mmm good! The corn bread muffin was a little on the dry side but at that point I really didn't care! Oh , I forgot to tell you that we ordered their "Chili-cheese & Brisket Fries". WOW. That's all I can say. Just WOW... One thing I WISH I WOULD HAVE ORDERED: The St. Louis style Pork Ribs. My son ordered them & couldn't finish his, so... what the hell, right? After about half a swallow, I was convinced that I'm getting a whole slab the next time I go back to Memphis Minnie's. I haven't had that kind of regret since I forgot my camera that time I saw Jessica Alba in a 2 piece bikini at the Kahala Mandarin Hotel... (did I just say that out loud?) Oh well... So, with all the praise I've just given this place, you're probably asking yourself: "Well then why did you only give them 4 stars?" It's simple. Portion size. Since my dish was $16.95 & included 3 items, I was thinking it would be a HUGE pile smokey BBQ... eh, it was ok. 4 slices of Brisket, about 3/4 cup of pulled pork & 4 rib tips. I hate to sound like a pig but dammit, I was hungry! Then I see some guy with a plate FULL of pork ribs... so again, it's no mystery what I'm getting next time. Bottom line: Eat Here. If you like spicy, please try some "BeezleBob's Breath". (hint: it's not on the table)

Hey, the 200+ people who gave Memphis minnie's a glowing rewiew! Where's your integrity? Where's your sense of reason? Have you all lost it? I, too, was once like you, cowed in believing minnie's was the best bbq place in sf. But beyond the shine and gloss of the reviews in the media, minnie fails to deliver great bbq. Memphis Minnie's is nothing more than an overpriced, overhyped bbq restaurant, where 15 dollars gives you shoddy food, rude service, and sticky tables brimming with unsanitary pork, beef, and sandwich juice. Yum! What's not missing is Minnie's apparent disregard for good tastes. Im shocked that im saying this, but their ribs resemble the shit found Nate's BBQ: underseasoned, overcooked, hidden by a cataract of their "famous" bbq sauce. While it's presumptuous to assume that a bbq house, known for their brisket, serves ribs that fall off the bone, but given the amount of money and hype surrounding minnie's, i expected -- at the very least -- for the ribs to be juicy. Juicy? nope. More like yucky. The briskets, however, wasn't as bad as the ribs. Kinda tender, kinda juicy, but way too little in proportions for the amount you're spending. 16 dollars for a dinner? With two measly sides? uh, thanks for ripping me off! And, oh, the sides! So many shortcomings: coleslaw, gross; ?uninspired corn muffin, super bland, and mac-n-cheese -- a reason why my tastebuds, today, hate the shit out of me. To your credit, minnie, you're way better than Nate's bbq.

Dry meat, lame bread, small sides, thin sauces, overpriced. Was looking at the menu when I came in for a while to get a feel of what they had. The guy at the counter was saying that I must have came in from some place nearby that after asking a friend, found out is a place where you can go and smoke yourself out. While that's all fine and dandy, it was an insult considering I wasn't at the place and don't smoke. No offense to the pot smokers among us. I'll pass.

I came here for the first time a couple of years ago and I remember the food being pretty good, the bbq sauce being really spicy (that always scores extra points with me) the bbq seasoned fries being spectacular and the service being great. The latter still holds true and maybe my palate has changed since then but on my recent visit, the brisket and pulled pork seemed to be dry, fries seemed a bit soggy and the spicy bbq sauce just didn't hit the spot. We always order a plate to share in order to get ?variety. The portion is generous enough for me and my boyfriend to share and we'll have some left over. I don't think there are many casual bbq joints like this in the city so I'll continue to ?come back but I'll try other things on the menu. I hear the chicken sandwich is a hit and the corn bread is wonderful! The place is really cute and I've never seen so many variations of pigs on display. It's fun looking around at all the items they have collected around the restaurant and the staff is warm, friendly and very attentive.

If you like dry-rub BBQ, Minnie's is for you. ?However, if you like juicy, finger-lickin' BBQ, maybe not. ?I had the pork ribs, smoked pork, and brisket, and while they were all tender and well cooked, I thought they were all pretty bland, and definately on the dry side. ?I had to squirt a bunch of the red BBQ sauce on everything to make them juicy and tangy enough. ?Sweet potatoes are definately southern style - very sweet. ?Slaw was average. ?Cornbread was a bit unusual, but nothing really special.

My partner and I had dinner here tonight and were sorely disappointed. ?Perhaps it's a cultural distinction, but we found the BBQ to be bland albeit nicely smoked. ?We are accustomed to choosing among mild, hot and fiery sauces and Minnie's offers none of those. My greens tasted too much like pickle juice and my slaw lacked any creaminess. ?My partner's sweet potatoes were bland and not sweet enough and his potato salad needed sweetness and salt. Signage is also lacking - we had to figure out for ourselves that orders are placed at the back of the restaurant. ?The order-taker was also too busy preparing desserts and answering the phone to take orders efficiently.

Ended up ordering: Two way combo with pulled pork and beef brisket - PULLED PORK was more like CRUMBS OF MEAT. ?Brisket and pork were incredibly dry and had to be doused with BBQ sauce to choke it down. ?BBQ should be long pieces of juicy meat that fall off the bone and leave sauce on your chin and corners of your mouth. ?MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT (*very sad face*) Fried catfish - done well, fried to a crisp in cornmeal (the only southern way to prepare catfish), but the pieces were just so darn small. ?Looked more like 3 fish nuggests. ?Soul food should be heaping, falling over your place and dripping over the side. Mac n cheese - not southern at all (chicken and waffles in oakland have it right) Greens - NIGHTMARE TIMES INFINITY!!! ?served in the south this way, they would be strung up by their toe nails.

Wow. I was expecting a lot more. 4 stars and 200 reviews!?! People, come on! I thought the rib tips were okay, some were hard and dry, some were extremely fatty, but there were a few that were delicious. And for those few, I licked the bone clean. They were out of the french fries, which was very disappointing, so I settled for mac & cheese and sweet potatoes. Again, both were okay. Also, the prices were a little higher than I would've liked.

To the right, is the seating area, which is very limited on seating capacity. My family and I planned on dining inside, but because they were crowded we opted to take out. Fine. Seating is on a first come, first serve basis so if you really want to sit down, swoop on it! The walls and counters of this place were adorned with pigs galore of all sorts: t-shirts, figurines, banks, pictures, etc. It looked like a piggy collection on display. Cute. Different. Nice. Fitting. The menu offers a nice selection; pulled pork, chicken (pulled or smoked), ribs, and more. You can also order by the pound if you're feelin' one specific meat more than another. I ordered a "pulled" spicy chicken sandwich with a side of potato salad. I couldn't wait to eat it because I was curious as to what "pulled" chicken tasted like, since I love pulled pork. Well....I opened up my box and found my sandwich nicely compiled, not sloppy, nice mound of potato salad and a small container of bbq sauce and mustard sauce. First bite: mmmm, omg that's good. Kinda dry, but good. I like that flavor, what is it? Second bite: yummm, flavorful, and tasty!! why isn't this spicy? (mustard sauce is starting to drip) Third bite: I like this.... I really like this sandwich. Wish it had more kick. I like pulled chicken, love that bbq flavor! Oh, and can't forget the potato salad between all my bites, tasted nice and light, but too vinegar-ish for my taste. I also had dry corn bread. Yes, DRY corn bread. I enjoyed my pulled spicy chicken sandwich, although it wasn't spicy at all. Whatsoever. ?But I will definitely be back here again.

"woohoo! as good as it gets!" in san francisco the quote is that text next to the five stars and as a barbecue place in this city, it's deserved. ?i can't boast being from the south, but i can say that somehow business travel and the big bbq cities and locations have consistently met up over nearly 12 years and 200k miles. ? and when i travel to these cities, bbq is what i look for. ?i'll make any trek from the hotel, sometimes stopping at 2 places a night. so, this is one of the very few places that gets it right. ?you have to like the dry rub memphis style, of course (you can't add the sauce at the table to make it truly "wet"). i've been here dozens of times and never been disappointed with anything on the menu, even the rib tips. ?well, maybe the bbq tri-tip could be better. ?i just don't think that cut of meat takes well to the smoke. ?it's far better slow-roasted on the grill than smoked. ?but you don't see that in bbq in the south anyway. ?traditionally that's an expensive cut of meat and not where bbq came from in the first place. all the sides are exceptional. ?the beans with their pulled pork in it. ?the greens. ?the mac and cheese. ?the french fries are almost dessert. Bob Kantor knows what he's doing and he doesn't mess with it. ?Sure there are daily special that are kinda fun, but that menu doesn't change and his cooking doesn't change.

Memphis Minnies--Best Barbecue I've had since Texas.... Unfortunately, it's still a far cry from a great overall dining experience Due to it's popularity, It's super crowded. ?Because of this, it's nearly impossible to get a seat--forget about waiting in the restaurant, there's barely a place to stand. Long, long lines! ?Insanely drunk foreigners walked away with my food before it was delivered to me, and the waiter offered to remake my food since the freaks manhandled it. ?"uh, yes please?" Meat was definitely on the fatty and dry side(oddly enough), but that was ameliorated by copious amounts of their Texas Red sauce. ?The sweet tea was great, but they ran out after one glass, and an overly surly and just-plain annoying waiter said "There's no way I'm going to go through 3 more gallons of sweet tea in 45 minutes" and refused to give me any more (free refills, ha!). ?Still thirsty, I tried three more taps (Coke, Sprite, and Root beer) and they too were out. ? The restaurant had a definite ambiance, however, I think they felt that in order to get an authentic BBQ house experience, they needed plenty of filth as well. ?Tables were barely washed off in a rush to get the next crowd of people seated, and as a result, the tables were sticky, and oddly glistening. ?Time to break out the Purell! Overall, the food was decent, but between the waiters with attitude, the crowds, and the filth, I came out of there smelling of barbecue, and disappointment.

I frickin' love this joint. ?I can't believe that I lived in the city for almost two years, rolling past fillmore and haight all the time, and never stopped in. ?After having to go back to Texas and esp. Houston for a year or so, BBQ became a staple, and now I don't see how I could survive the city without Minnie's. I'll agree that lunch specials are not all that great, but I don't care much about sides, and the place is small. ?My girlfriend and I can split a pound of brisket for $13.99, just two dollars more than it would cost in Texas, but it is far more tender and lean. ?In The South(tm), BBQ places are bigger and cheaper because they do volume in low-rent shacks and even sometimes cook outdoors. ?So, these guys have gotta pay their rent in the haight, and we all knew we were going to lose a few square feet when moving from the South - esp Texas - to the bay area, that apparently includes the BBQ joints. I like the meat at Minnie's with and without sauce, their Texas Red is pretty good but honestly, they could stand to pick up a case of Stubb's from Austin, which is available here in the city at Whole Foods (hint, hint). ?As so many BBQ connoisseur will say, and you may read on some newspaper articles on the tables, it's not about the sauce, it's about the meat, and Minnie's do a good job. ?For one, also, if you like to go low carb, sauce is not so great for you, but brisket, grilled chicken, etc.. fit the bill right off the fire. As to those who knew what to expect and did not like it, I say give 'em another try. ?I've had it be acceptable-good on some days and amazing-good on others, like April 20, when they were packed. ?BBQ is about soul and there is no up without down.

"What did the pig say when it was hot out?"....."I'm bacon!" Hahah...love it. This was the joke on the table where I sat while I enjoyed my two plate combo (beef brisket and tri tip with a side of sweet potato, corn muffin, and mac and cheese). The two plate combo was perfect for two, I think I would have definitely been in a food coma if I ate the entire thing myself.

I'm part of that 1% of black people who could care less one way or the other about barbeque. ?I don't crave it, I don't get all excited when people say their cousin's throwing down in their backyard, and it's not a regular ?part of my diet to knaw the meat off of bones. ?Fried chicken, on the other hand... Given this little fact, it is no wonder why I do not frequent BBQ joints with any great regularity. ?Enter today: Momster's out for pig blood and has made a request for BBQ. ?Me and Dadster head out to run errands, picking up the 'que on the way back. ?San Francisco is not known for its 'que places, let's just get that out of the way. ?So, there are locations few and far between that would be worth any visit. ?I can name a handful. ?But I suggest Memphis Minnie's because since it's on the parental dime, I could get down with some brisket. ? We order the brisket, a plate of pork ribs for Mom, and sides of Mac 'n' Cheese, Fried Cheese Grit Sticks, and the Smoky Beans. In a nutshell: The Swine: Can't comment because I didn't have any The Meat between the cow's front legs: Deliciously beefy MnC: Tasty, but in a bland way - had to put some real cheese on it Grits: Not a fan of the shell, but really liked the inside Beans: Listen up, if you can BITE INTO your bean, it ain't done Sauce: Never been a fan of either of the sauces, but this day I decided to check it out and they were okay I'm sure in Memphis, the creed goes something like, The Lord, then swine, then family, but this CA girl isn't convinced.

On a recent trek to Rosamunde's, fate played a funny trick on me and vacated the parking spot right in front of Memphis Minnie's BBQ just as I pulled up. ?Since I had already planted the seed of Rosamunde's in the brain of my boyfriend, I felt bad even looking at Memphis Minnie's from the car window because I knew that the first words out of my mouth were going to be something like "Hmm ... I've never been to Memphis Minnie's before. ?Have you?" ?And then I knew he'd suggest we try it if I really wanted to, then we'd have a six minute conversation about which place we should go to ... then we'd end up going to Rosamunde's anyway since that was the plan. We went to Rosamunde's and Toronado and inhaled sausage and sucked down pomegranate cider like they were going out of style. ?So damn good! ? Then... After Rosamunde's as we were walking back to the car, I asked if he'd wait a sec while I ran up to peer at the menu. ?No problem, he said. ?Took me a while, so he walked over to the menu to join me. ?I then asked if he'd wait a sec while I ran inside to take a look and maybe get a side of macaroni and cheese for a snack later on. ?No problem, he said and joined me inside. ? When it was my turn at the register, I had to ask about the pastrami sandwich since it happened to be the ONE day per week that they serve it. ?The guy said I HAD to get it. ?Even though the Rosamunde sausage I had just inhaled a couple minutes before still was working its way down to my stomach, I ordered the pastrami sandwich with a side of macaroni and cheese to go. ? After a few minutes of waiting, my meal was ready to go. ?I was eager to get home so I could have a taste before everything got cold. ?Funny thing is, not one whiff of pastrami or cheese or anything leaked from the bag into the car. ?The food didn't smell like anything. ?I just figured they did a good job of packing it or something, but when I got home and opened it ... I needed a microscope to locate the slivers of beef (very bland ... didn't even taste like pastrami) hidden between the large pieces of bread. ?My macaroni noodles were bloated (although a nice curly shape that I liked), and the sauce was flavorless. ?The sauces that they included for me to taste were unlike any BBQ sauce that I've ever had. ?Very thin and "raw" ... like they needed to be boiled or something to enrich the flavor and thicken up. They people who work here were very nice, and it seems that they have a loyal following. ?I can't believe that everything they serve is as disappointing as their pastrami was. ?Perhaps I should have ordered the ribs despite what the counter guy recommended? Two stars. ?One for the friendly service. ?Another because I'm an optimist today.

I could hear my arteries screaming at me on my way in the door but I listened to my hangover and pushed ahead. This is BBQ done right and authentic to it's Memphis roots. We shared a few main dishes, a 12er of the pork ribs, the pulled pork and about five sides. Everything was excellent the greens and beans of ?particular highlight from the sides and both the ribs and pulled pork were cooked to rich delicious perfection. Don't expect a high five if you see your cardiologist inside, but if you're looking for great comfort-laden, authentic Memphis bbq, Minnies is the place for you.

I know I shouldn't do this, but I'm gonna do it anyway. ?There's just no avoiding it. ?I hold any barbeque place to a rather high standard because - well, I'm Texan. ?It's like another tier on the food pyramid for us (right next to steak, bacon, potatoes, and beer). I kid, of course - somewhat. Another fellow Texan took me to this joint because she told me that it was pretty good. ?Overall, I think she was right. ?I got the beef brisket, which was a pretty large portion (very nice) but it was rather dry (not so nice). ?After drenching it in the red sauce (you can't miss it, it's the one with the least amount of all three bottles on the table because it's the most popular) it was quite enjoyable. I recommend getting fries as a side, mostly because the macaroni and cheese is dry and flavorless, and quite below par of the good 'ol blue box from the grocery store. The only major props I give this place is the nice people, and their sweet tea. ?It was quite delicious. ?It's not the same as the joints in Texas, but it's...aiite.

I must give thanks to the Food Network for their frequent BBQ shows. ?In combination to you and Memphis Minnie's I now understand that great BBQ does not come from the McRib or Costco. ? Memphis Minnie's is terrific for that smokey flavor and that chorcoal black stuff it can leave on your fingers. ?I had the Pork Shoulder and St. Louis Ribs, both so tender that the meat fell off the bone. ?A great sign for a BBQ place. ?The decor leaves a little to be desired, but hey its a BBQ place, so I let that pass. ? The cornbeard wasn't too great either, but the fries were awesome and so was the service, a greeting at the door no less. ? 5 stars to my new favorite BBQ place in the city!

I miss their brunch. I am a Southerner, and this has to be one of my favorite places to eat BBQ in the Bay Area, no disrespect to my fellow Southerners. The brisket is tender, the chicken is good, the spicy fries and mac n cheese and dr. pepper in a bottle were my comfort food after I quit one humongously awful job. And also the banana pudding and pecan pie. Mm mm mm. The music playing is always good: Aretha, Johnny, Ray, Elvis, etc. A sides, B sides, good good good. I love the down home feel - checked table cloths, the help-yourself bottles of sauce: Texas Red, Carolina Vinegar, and the other one. And of course, the roll of paper towels that sit atop the table. As my mama would say, "Community property." Go to Memphis Minnie's - it will do your soul some good. (Supposedly, they are known for combining BBQ with sake, but I have yet to try it.)

I've been delaying my review of Memphis Minnie's for almost a year, because I wanted to try a wide variety of meats before offering my verdict, but now that I've been here at least a half dozen times, I can say with confidence that while this place is cool (it's got that hole-in-the-wall mom 'n pop feel), it's definitely not my favorite place to have ribs or BBQ meats. My biggest complaint about Memphis Minnie's is that all their meats are on the dry side. Even my favorite, the Texas Big Bones, is a little dry. Yes, yes, I understand that you're supposed to drown the meat in their special sauce, but you know what? I don't really like their sauce. *GASP* Don't throw rocks at me, but I think Tony Roma's is better; the meat on their ribs falls right off. I haven't experienced that yet at Memphis Minnie's (I've tried both their regular ribs and their baby back ribs) and for $10-14 per plate (comes with two sides and a cornbread, which is really hard and cold, by the way), I just don't think it's really worth it for me to keep coming back and getting disappointed. I'm sorry, I really wanted this to work out.

There's alotta hype about this little joint in the Haight, and I wanted to know what all the commotion was about. My dad and I stopped in here on a Saturday night and it was packed! The atmosphere of the joint is pretty cool with wall to wall pig paraphernalia and customer drawings of none other than pigs on the tables. The staff are quick and efficient and got through the lines of people like it was nothing, so although the place may seem crowded when you go, it's usually not too long of a wait. Once you order your food, the staff are quick to see that you get a table. On our trip, my Dad and I ordered the sausage, the rib tips, smoked pork and beef brisket. Far and away, the best meat dish there was the beef brisket. It was slow smoked and maintained a lovely, fatty richness that went well with the vinegary, chili accompaniments at the table. The other meats were simply average compared to the brisket. There was a wide range of sides to choose from including Mac and Cheese, Beans, Collared Greens, and Corn Muffins, but again, there was really nothing to write home about. Everything really seemed average and comparable to any other BBQ joint. There aren't too many BBQ houses around the neighborhood, so its safe to say Memphis Minnie's can feed the average BBQ fix, but I'm still on a quest to find something a little bit more satisfying.

Word of advice: Don't have your friend grab a table while you line up to order food. They will bark at you to ONLY grab a table after you've ordered. I'm thinking, "Okay, okay, simma down now....I'll order THEN sit. Jeez." The guy taking your order is not always the happiest camper in the world. You'd think he would be freakin cheery as hell with all that BBQ behind him. The food is pretty good...I usually get a trip tip sandwich. They hallow out the bread so you can fill it with one of their BBQ sauces if you so desire. The bf gets a combo plate of some smokey brisket and ribs. Their corn bread is okay, but aside from that I don't particularly love any of their other sides. Everytime I eat here, I have to get the fried cheese grit sticks; it comes with the best dipping sauce. Their banana pudding is the only dessert Ive tried. It's topped with whipped cream and 'nilla wafers so you know it's all good. The decor at Memphis Minnie's is eclectic and they have some very cool things to look at while you wait for your order. Usually, your table will have drawings from past patrons under the glass. There are posters and t-shirts of various BBQ-centric events on the walls and you can't miss the flying pig above the register. Prices are not bad for the portion you get. MM is the place we will continue to go to when we gotta have BBQ. They are closed Mondays.

Real Barbecue! It's hard to find a place that is willing to go out of their way to cook great barbecue in the Bay Area. Memphis Minnie's is that place. We've been here several times and have tried different items. The brisket is divine - the crust, the flavor. Mmm! I think I'm hungry again. The Texas Big Beef Ribs - I had been looking for those forever, soooo good and cooked just right. The Andouille sausage, the best I've ever had. Word to the wise - NEVER ask for baby back ribs. I had the pleasure of witnessing the bearded man behind the counter give an aptly dressed yuppie a quick lesson in Barbecue 101. This isn't a place of bottomless, flavorless ribs. This is the REAL DEAL. I wasn't too keen on the sides with the exception of the corn muffin. I skip them and go straight for the main course. Know what to expect - this is a no fuss barbecue joint serving authentic smoked barbecue. Parking is hard to come by so expect to walk a few blocks.

I don't get everyone saying that we don't have great BBQ in SF and why this place doesn't have a higher rating. ?I used to live in South Carolina and they are pretty BBQ crazy there, same with the folks in North Carolina. ?I've had BBQ in Texas and the great city of Memphis, Tennessee as well. ?I also went to school in SLO where everyone is BBQ crazy (home of tri tip). ?I would put Memphis Minnie's head to head against any of those places. I love how they have the sauces on the side at the table so you can try them all. ?The sampler is a great way to try a little of everything. ?The sides are really good too. ?I think that my favorites are the pork ribs and the brisket. ?Really good portions, good prices and good people that are really passionate about what they do.

It's ok for a quick to go meal especially when there are few BBQ places in SF. The pork is probably the best thing they have but the brisket is ok too. I am not a huge fan of the sauce and the sides are mediocre. If you are craving BBQ, there are not a whole lot of options in the area so suck it up and enjoy. At least the atmosphere is inviting and fun.

I haven't actually set foot inside Memphis Minnies but they provided all the grilled meats for the 6.6.6 party at Idle Hand last night. ?Just on the food alone I can give this place 4 stars for their BBQ. ?The ribs were a bit tough but they still tasted good. ?The meat that left the biggest impression on me though was the brisket. ?Easily the best brisket I have tasted and I've had BBQ in Kansas City, Atlanta, Austin, and have even attended the National BBQ Championships in Washington DC 3 times. ?Someone mentioned to me that if I thought the brisket was good I should make it a point to go early and try their bacon. ?My mouth is watering just thinking about how good their bacon tastes. I finally ate at Memphis Minnie's for brunch yesterday. ?I know that I should have probably tried something that I hadn't eaten already but I couldn't pass up the beef brisket in hash form with two poached eggs and a cornbread biscuit. ?I got a side of bacon too! ?The brisket has some serious flavor going on. ?It's just unreal how much flavor is packed into each bite. ?I can't imagine any sane person putting any kind of sauce on the brisket. ?With some nice poached eggs on top they are just that much better. ?The cornbread was pretty damn good too. ? Now the bacon was just great. ?This was some real meaty and flavor packed bacon. ?It wasn't a slinky strip of fat with tiny meat bits attached. One thing to consider is that they don't have a whole lot of seating so you either want to get there before the crowd comes in or take it home. ?Being that I live in the East Bay I'm going to have to make sure I get here early when I come for brunch. ?Oh, they have house cured and smoked pastrami on Wednesdays, if I remember correctly. ?I might have to get down there for lunch one day to try one of those!

If you want good barbecue and want to save yourself the cost of a ticket to the southern states, Memphis Minnie's is the place. ? They barbecue all their meats dry and you put the sauce on the meat at the table.

I was super skeptical of this place when my friends said there was an "amazing" BBQ place in the Lower Haight. I was like "Lower Haight? What are they gonna do? Serve pork shoulders on Descendents LP's and put sweet tea in a hookah? How does that add up?" To me saying anyone in San Francisco had good BBQ was just poor math. You might as well try to make Chocolate and Pine Cones add up to Unicorn. BUT, this place is amazing. I feel qualified to say that because I fucking lived in Memphis and have spent time in the BBQ dungeon that is the internationally renowned Rendezvous. I have licked my fingers clean of the sticky blood of many fallen rib warriors that have bowed before my mandible's voracious killspree. And I'm a wet BBQ man myself, but this place's table sauce offerings are so perfectly flavorful that you can douse a dry pork chunk in them and it's like some sort of weird dry-wet hybrid I like to call water-rock. Yeah, water-rock. Doesn't that sound like an awesome new off-road vehicle or stupid Burning Man jam band. It does, cause it's awesome. I recommend no matter what you get a cornbread muffin with whatever you get. Those things are sweeter than Wonder Years re-runs on a rainy Sunday afternoon, when you're girlfriend wants to make you cocoa and warm up left over chili.

After being disappointed a couple times, I've decided to bring out the ban hammer on this joint. Yet another local restaurant that wants to be loved, but the quality control for the food is wanting. My #1 complaint is leather dry BBQ. Sometimes it's the pork ribs. Sometimes it's the brisket. Sometimes it's the beef ribs. Even the Wednesday special pastrami isn't immune from this problem. Then there was the time where the meats left an unpleasant smoky taste in my mouth that didn't want to leave. It's like playing Russian roulette every time you go there. If y'all like bone dry BBQ, then y'all be in hog heaven at Memphis Minnie's, ya hear? Well sorry, but I don't. It's pretty obvious the guys in the kitchen don't sample each batch of Q before hacking the meat up and serving it on the plate. I would really like them to taste what they're serving up to the public. I do like their complement of sauces, except their habanero sauce. The red, mustard, and vinegar sauces have a nice tangy taste and complement the meats nicely - when they aren't dry as leather. Side dishes like potato salad, coleslaw, cornbread, chili, and BBQ fries are decent. Stay away from the mac & cheese tho'. The cheese is usually clumpy, like it's been sitting around for a while on the steam table vat. The crew working the restaurant is nice. They make you feel welcome. Can't fault their service at all. In closing, if I'm paying close to $20 on lunch or dinner, I'd rather spend it at a place that maintains a consistent quality of food. Every meal shouldn't come with a dish that makes you think, "Oh, I could have had a better version of this dish at restaurant X." Memphis Minnie's, you've made me think that thought too many times, and I don't want to be disappointed anymore.

Best BBQ on the west coast. Each sauce, each meat, each side is a recreation of a specific type of BBQ; it's all very impressive. I'll take a blocked artery for this place any day.

I'm sorry. This place is buschleague. If there's any food I know, it's BBQ. ?I've had great ribs 'n fixins all over the country and this place just doesn't cut it. ?I've been a few times and had a variety of dishes, but it's just too "San Francisco" for a BBQ joint. ?I'm not saying the place is too "classy" for a BBQ joint. But BBQ should be no-nonsense comfort food. Oh - and affordable. Sorry, but I'm not paying 13 dollars for a glammed up pulled pork sandwich and a small shitty side dish.

I have a bright yellow flyer from Memphis Minnie's indicating they deliver. ?I called. ?They would not deliver. ?No problem... moving onto I'll go pick up. ?Tried to order. ?The guy was just not cooperating. ?This was out. ?That wasn't do'able. ?When he said that I had to order a sweet potato pie a week in advance - I finially got it - they don't want my business. ?What should have been a $150.00 order to them became a no order and I'll never try again. ?I was bending every which way to make this work and Memphis Minnie's was all about saying no.

Came here for the first time last week for dinner. ?The St Louis ribs were fantastic. ?It's not very often that you can find a place where the ribs are good enough to eat plain. ?I love the multiple varieties of sauce that you can mix and match to get your own flavor. ?The mac n cheese is REALLY good. ?The downside...they will charge you extra if you request both of your side dishes to be mac n cheese (this extra charge is not shown on the menu). ? Although good, the food is pricey for the amount that you get.

I have been passing by this place for 6 years without ever visting, but last night I did with my friend and I am so glad. I was skeptical at first of the size of the beef brisket I ordered, but when I was done eating it I was full. The flavor of the wood & smoke was so characteristically strong, it was a taste I seldom find. I live off of Geary near Roadhouse BBQ, where I have been a bunch of times, and Minnies definitely had better wood bbq flavor. We'll be visiting here again. A word of caution: watch out for their "Beezlebub" sauce, it's dangerous even for pro's who like hot sauce.

18 bucks for a beef brisket & tri-tip with two sides. And they forgot my brisket, argh! BBQ in San Francisco makes about as much sense as a vegetarian restaurant in Dallas. But after Bay to Breakers we ended up here, and I was truly curious what the Bay Area's take on BBQ was. I'm pleased to say this was much better than the BBQ I'm used to from Florida. That's to say, no sickly sweet sauces poured over everything in over-abundance. The tri-tip was great, not overly dry as tri-tip tends to be when prepared by amateurs. My sides of sweet potatoes and greens were also good. 5 stars for the sweet potatoes and 3 stars for the greens. ?Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of green vegetables, and just got them so I didn't feel too guilty about the whole meal. You're probably not going to find a place to sit, so bring your food to one of the nearby bars and grab a beer. If you're in the Haight, it's worth dropping by. ?But make sure you have the money to spare, because Memphis Minnie's isn't cheap.

My Husband & I ordered from here tonight for the first time. We had them deliver.. and HOLY CRAP these guys are fast! It took like 25 minutes for them to deliver to us... I was chatting a bit with the delivery dude, and apparently they *bicycle* all the deliveries. Massive respect to those guys! The portions were HUGE and the price was totally reasonable. Two rib plates (with 2 sides each), plus the delivery charge & taxes- came to a total of $36. ? Order the BBQ Fries. They're delicious. One star taken off because generally I like 'saucy' ribs.. and Minnies seems to mostly do the more dry-rubbed variety. They do send along two little sides of house BBQ sauces. Neither of them really did it for my husband and I. Whatever though- still yummy! I still can't get over how fast the delivery came... Jesus. Tip your delivery guy well!

A bbq place that has bbq sauce so STUPID HOT that you don't just pay for it the next day, but mere hours after you've eaten it?? That in itself deserves all the stars in the world!!! The restaurant is super casual - you order from the counter, grab a table, wait for your order to be done and you go pick it up. There are several bottles of bbq sauce on each table and they also sell the sauce for you to take home. We ordered the beef ribs/pork ribs/tri-tip combo with seasoned fries, cornbread and coleslaw. The ribs, though tasty, were a little too dry for me and not falling off the bones but the bbq sauce definitely helped make it more moist. Tri-tip was much better. Maybe it was an off day, so I'll have to go back again to try a second time. What I did love, love, love is their tangy coleslaw! I loved it so much I bought a pint of it to go and we also wanted to try a pint of potato salad. Customer service was great! The guy who took our order the first time remembered Boo's name when we went back up a second time to order the sides to go. And he was nice enough to charge us only for one of the pints instead of both. It's the little things like that which makes a big difference as to whether we'd come back or not.

The meat has a good smokey flavor to it. If you get the sandwiches, it's pretty much a simple meat and bread formula. The various kinds of sauces on the tables can give it more of a kick I had the pork sandwich and I was expecting a slightly bigger portion for what I paid for. A big disappointed here! When I took my first bite I noticed the smokiness, but after a while I realized that's about the only kind of flavor I'm tasting besides the special BBQ sauce they had. I tried some of my friends' food and I can say the same about their orders as well. Although, they seemed to have enjoyed this place much more than I did. They said they would come back. I would too, but maybe not as eager as they did. I will give them props on their customer service. They were friendly and kind of joked around a little, which I liked. If I do some back I'm going to order some of the fries. I looked at the table next to ours and that's all I could focus on.

Memphis Minnie's is a great place to visit for the full experience, and CRIKEY they now deliver!!! ?We ordered in for a delicious Friday night treat. It's a $25 minimum for delivery, but that's pretty easy to reach - what with delicious sides that you'll definitely want a pint of, and tasty mains. ?Their sides impressively don't taste oily, but are more tart with vinegar, and definitely remind me of my visits to Memphis and Mississippi. ?I had a delicious Southern Star sandwich, and appreciated that it came with two kinds of sauce on the side. ?The combination of Southern home-style-ness along with CA ingredients makes Memphis Minnie's one of my two favorite BBQ places I've been to (the other is Tupelo's in Cambridge, MA). ?I absolutely love barbecue sauce as a condiment, but Memphis Minnie's makes ingredients shine such that one wouldn't want to douse them in sauce. The only down sides to the delivery experience: ?they can't deliver sweet tea, and I should have mentioned over the phone that I needed a copy of the receipt since the delivery guy couldn't give me one.

Memphis Minnie's was quite a disappointment for me. ?I don't really know why I had such high hopes for them.. I guess it could be the hokey sign, or maybe fact that it's in the lower haight (one of my favorite SF neighborhoods), or maybe it's because I just assume Memphis is synonymous with amazing BBQ. ? But my expectations crashed deep into the Mississippi when my BBQ taster plate came out with 3 small slices of brisket, dried out tri-tip, and 3 little pork ribs. ?So sad. ?I probably used half of the bottle of red bbq sauce they provide on the table to overcome the dryness of the meat. I must say the ribs were pretty good, tender, but still not nearly the best I've ever had. ?Also the cornbread and mac n cheese were tasty too. ? We also got a pulled spicy chicken sandwich that was well-seasoned and had a good kick to it. ?It was served on a soft roll which is perfect for a pulled meat sandwich. ?I hate when the bread is too chewy and all the meat comes out the other side. ?Totally defeats the purpose of a sandwich. ? The guy taking orders at the counter was super chill and nice too so it kind of pains me to give them just 3 stars, but i'm sorry there's just no excuse for dry-ass tri-tip.

If you've read any of my reviews, you know that I'm nostalgic. If you haven't read them, I just told you. I grew up in Texas, eating mostly crap and barely edible things. Barbeque is practically health food where I come from. I've been a transplant now for more years than I lived in Texas willingly. That makes me, well, not quite a Californian, but definitely an ex-Texan. Still, I miss barbeque Texas-style, and, until tonight, hadn't found it in the Bay Area. I had to hold onto my proverbial hat as I walked in this joint. The smell brought it all back in a split second. Aroma de smoked meat everywhere. Gawd damn! The space is decidedly not Texas-size, but more one of these long, skinny restaurants, a row of tables on one side, kitchen and ordering line on the other. I got a Cajun andouille sausage sandwich with a side of "potata" salad, and Tara R. got the slow-smoked Texas brisket sandwich and BBQ-seasoned, hand-cut fries. We sat down to wait on our food, and noted that each table is equipped with its own paper towel roll and a bevy of sauces, including North Carolina vinegar, South Carolina mustard, and Texas red. Just seeing that bottle of Texas red made my heart even warmer. We doused our sandwiches in said Texas red, per my childhood, and ate in utter delight. Even Tara, who's not from there, saw what joy good barbeque can bring. I will definitely go back here often, and would give it a 4.5 if possible.

Succulent pork ribs, richly flavored greens, sinfully tasty cornbread, housed in a traditionally lower-Haight ambience. ?A cozy dive staffed with apropos Haight-like bohemian characters, all of which seem to possess a surprisingly good customer facing attitude. ?The ambience is undeniably hipster, nothing fancy, albeit moderately neat and well-kept. ?My little disappointment: ?soggy french fries ... but this could have been a function of the fact I took my pork ribs and sides to go, hence latency between cook time and chow time. Overall, definitely a much better BBQ joint than the one by my South of Market hood.

My first experience with Memphis Minnie's is blurry. ?I was at Molotov's playing dominoes with some friends, or maybe it was cards, who knows, and then went to Memphis Minnie's because I heard someone talking about and eating their pork egg rolls...well, I was sorta buzzed, and it seemed like a great idea! Turns out it was! ?I got two orders, and ate them in about 17 seconds. If anything, I give them four stars for those...insanely good. their sides are good, their sauces exceptional, and you can tell that the staff likes their own food! ?:) ?I have been here a few times, and love how easy it is to get a table. ?The bbq meat is also good, can be dry at times, but the sauce is there to cover that. For dessert I have tried their peach empanadas and the slice of pecan pie (I know, I'm a lush when it comes to dessert). ?Both were good, but the pecan pie was worth going back for.

I enjoy good smoked brisket and pork baby back ribs, so when yesterday I got cravings for the BBQ, I already had idea to check this place out, not that I have never been there - no, please! I ate there, but it was during my first days in SF, and I barely remember my past experience. So I was rushing to get my portion of protein, when we got there - I totally loved the atmosphere, looks like "hole in the wall joint", has it's unique character. My fiancee ordered brisket and chili French fries and 2 sweet teas (I miss South!), and we decided to split it, since it's always too much food for us. (by the way we paid $30 including tip - I'll say too much for that taste and quality). So brisket was good, but fries...hm, I wouldn't say so, first they were over fried, actually burned, and had the taste of refried oil, you know, that harsh flavor? I liked their sauces, but everything had taste of vinegar to it. If you go there to get just meat -- it's your place! P.S. I am still fan of "Tommy's Joint" :)

Holy meat galore! A long-time lover of all things meat, I was really looking forward to a meat feast at Memphis Minnie's. While it certainly hit the spot in the meat category (not only was I still full when I woke up the next morning, I was craving salad... and I am NOT a salad person), it left something to be desired in the taste department. Perhaps I'm just not a big fan of dry rubs... While I know that a huge part of American BBQ is the sauces, I also feel that great BBQ shouldn't rely on sauces alone. The meat itself should be so well seasoned and marinated that it renders the sauces somewhat unnecessary. This was not the case here. I found myself squirting puddle after puddle of sauces on my plate - not because I thought they were particularly amazing (though the South Caroline mustard and Texas red sauces were pretty good), but because my taste buds were yearning for more flavour. I shared a Minnie's Taster (3 meats, 2 sides, and a corn muffin) with a friend. We chose the Texas big BEEF RIBS, Memphis sweet SMOKED PORK, their famous Texas beef BRISKET, bbq seasoned FRIES and SWEET POTATOES (http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­). My favourite was the smoked pork, followed by the tender brisket. The beef ribs were ok and I wonder if I would've liked the pork ribs more. To be honest, all the meats tasted the same to me - that is, they tasted like whatever sauce I doused them with. The only difference was their textures. I actually enjoyed the sides more than I did the meats. The bbq fries were delicious but extremely greasy; the majority of them were translucent (and soggy) with oil. The sweet potatoes were good, but how can you go wrong with cubed baked sweet potatoes? I also liked the sweet and sour potlikker greens. My favourite dish of the night, hands down, was the amazing MAC & CHEESE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­) that we ordered on the side. It was so much better (and cheaper!) than the mac n cheese I had at Wayfare Tavern and Bobo's recently. It was flavourful but not too saucy or rich. I just LOVED it! The service was also great. They remembered our names and the owner even came by twice to ask us how we're doing!

Came here as a stop along our quest for the best BBQ in the Bay Area. ?And I liked it. ?Kind of a random spot for a BBQ place, but the decor definitely makes up for it. ?Got a brisket sandwich and corn bread muffin. ?The corn bread muffin made me frown because it was so hard and dry. ?The brisket was decent though, especially with their arsenal of sauces. And I don't really get the whole pairing with sake. ?Kinda weird.

My house in San Francisco is 100 feet up the hill from Memphis Minnie's and the woodsmoke drives me crazy every Wednesday morning. This is seriously good Texas-style BBQ which will be marred if you eat there by Minnie's habit of serving it on a crusty sourdough french roll. Fortunately, the solution is simple: buy a pound of brisket to go (check your order before you leave; they've been known to slip in a hunk o' fat) and serve it on a soft bun from Safeway as it was meant to be eaten. If you like pork, try the rib tip plate which is almost always on special and a great value. The sides are way expensive relative to the meat and not distinguished except for the wonderful sour slaw; fortunately the recipe has been published (go to http://sfgate.com and do a search for "slaw, glorious slaw" in the full archive) so you can make your own.

About a year and a half ago, the only two BBQ places I found i San Francisco was Ironwood and Roadside. ?At that time, I lamented and rated Ironwood as "the best" I found in SF. ? Thankfully I discovered Memphis Minnie's. ? Their beef brisket taste and texturally was very moist and tender. ?I found their quality to be up to par with the BBQ I've had in Austin. ?However, I do have to admit that their sides and the sauce itself didn't stand out. ?The mac n cheese was 1) too runny and 2) too spicy. ?The same could be said about the baked beans. ?Their cornbread well...it existed and didn't do nothing beyond that. ? Loved their sweet tea. ?I would have to say that the quality of the brisket and the sweet tea alone won me over to the 4 Star range. ?As of now, this is the best BBQ I've had in the city limits of San Francisco, but being an Oakland native, that doesn't say much.

I was craving for bbq meat for the longest time and I had to see what the fuse was all about. Nicely themed, pigs everywhere. We shared the combo with three different meats. Most of them were pretty good, some of the pieces were dry though. The mac & cheese was good. Their fries were flavorful. They were quick with my order. However, when it came to my bf's it took about 20mins. He ordered after we were half way through the combo. The servers were very apologetic and even gave us his order for free. I noticed that they try to strive on customer services, that's a BIG PLUS, in my book.

The food here is excellent, although it loses a 5 star rating because there's never any room to sit down, and the wait to get your food is getting longer and longer each time I go..I remember going once a few years ago and getting my sandwich and side within 5 minutes of ordering it (not even that fast), and recently (about a month ago) I went in after ordering ahead on the phone to avoid waiting and still had to wait another 20 minutes in addition to the 15 I gave them before I even showed up...all that for a barbecue sandwich in a styrofoam tray!?

I have pretty high standards when it comes to BBQ, so maybe I am being a little tough on this joint with 3 stars, but it was exactly that "A-Ok". It is definitely a hole in the wall type place (def not a romantic first date type spot, but good for a quick bite) with a good selection on their menu. But you do not sit and they take your order, you stand in line, give your order and they call you up to grab your food.... I tried the pulled pork sandwich with the Mac and Cheese side. The meat is very tender and tasty, however it was not cooked with BBQ sauce. One of the selling points for this place is the ability to select your own sauce that is on the table. The sauces were mediocre at best ?and are not standard.. There is a vinegar sauce, a spicy sauce, a red sauce (tasted like red enchilada sauce), and a spicy mustard sauce... All i wanted was some good old fashioned original BBQ taste and there was nothing even comparable. The Mac was delicious tho! Very yumm! I also tried the deep fried peach pie and sweet iced tea. The tea was a little watered down and the pie was very tart. And it's not so much a pie as it is a turnover. I wouldn't get it again. Also, I felt the server was a little rude taking my order. I wanted to ask questions about the menu and he seemed a little irritated with me because of it.... All in All, just OK

You know what I got no beef with this place? Wait a minute, I did get the beef here. Like all beer swilling, manly men, I love me some BBQ. Thank goodness for Memphis Minnie's for offering up some good ol' BBQ in the Haight area. Okay I will admit it, I've never tried "authentic" Midwest or Southern style BBQ. I only know of the Northern California interpretations. As far as I know, Memphis Minnie's only serves up the slow cooked and smokey good stuff. Whether you choose to go here or just order in (you can easily order online from Grubhub), you are in for some good and tasty meaty eats. They serve up fall off the bone ribs (Texas style, whatever that means) as well as a smokey, moist, and fatty (thus flavorful) beef brisket. I am partial to the beef brisket which is just sliced slabs of meat. It comes with two good dipping sauces (a BBQ style sauce and a spicy mustard sauce), but I prefer my meat just plain. I'd rather not let the flavor of the sauce overpower the taste of the meat. ? The sides here good as well. Not a huge fan of their corn bread muffin, which is too dry for my taste. But I really like the sweet potatoes here. This is the perfect sweet (and relatively healthy) complement to any BBQ dish. It's hard to hate BBQ unless you have no soul (but you probably have bigger things to worry about like eternal damnation, but let's not go there). You can't go wrong with the offerings here at Memphis Minnie's. This is a great place to eat if you are in the mood for some real deal authentic (Northern California style) BBQ.

No, no, no. ?I'm sorry, but my idea of a pulled pork sandwich is not a bunch of dry meat on bread. ?And the whole cole slaw thing was some kind of weird pickled nightmare - with chunks of carrots and red peppers, no less. ?As my friend Al might say, "That _wasn't_ cole slaw."

My Dad loves the food here and requested it specifically, so I went in on a Sunday night about 6:30 to pick up an order I had called in (they forgot about the call the first time around so my husband called back from his cell phone on the way). ? We ordered two slabs of the pork ribs, which my Dad would definitely give 5-stars, a pound of the sweet pork (which was not sweet or seemed to be particularly seasoned at all, but very tender) and corn muffins (I didn't like them - too dry and crunchy - but others eating with me liked them just fine with butter slabbed on). ?They quoted us 20-minutes and then we got there it was ready to go - - - minus the corn muffins, but we caught it and added it in to the order. They didn't give us enough sauce IMO for the amount of meat we ordered and my Dad had to open up a bottle of some other kind of sauce he had in the pantry - not a big deal. ?But, since it was for my Dad's birthday I should have bought a bottle of sauce to make sure he 100% enjoyed his meal. ? Service is super friendly but you will wait a while to order during the dinner rush. ?Not a place to go for a "quick bite," but such great BBQ and if you are dining in, it's worth the wait. P.S. FYI, my Dad also asked us to get red beans and rice from Popeye's (Divisadero & Hayes). ?His favorite side for BBQ! ?Can't beat the price and the flavor was actually not bad! ?Happy Birthday Dad!!!

Oh. My. God. Let me set this up for you. I'm not from here. I'm from the south. A place where sweet tea flows like water, where pulled pork is served no less than once a week. I came to San Francisco nearly eight months ago, and while I've had some fantastic food here, I haven't had any real barbecue. Thank God for Memphis-effing-Minnie's. The menu had me at "sweet tea." At long last, REAL sweet tea. (Not that crap they try passing off as sweet tea at McDonald's). It sounds lame, but I knew I was in a real BBQ joint when I saw tables covered in sticky plastic checkered tablecloths. I had the pulled pork plate with sweet--are you ready--"POTATAS," sweet coleslaw and cornbread. Finger-lickin' good. Okay, the cornbread was a little dry, but the pork was phenomenal. REAL pulled pork. The barbecue sauces was great. I had Heidi's Fried Peach Pies for dessert. Anything fried and covered in powdered sugar is going to get an A+ in my book, so no point in reviewing that one. I drank sweet tea to my heart's content and made sure to clean my plate. It's like a little piece of home right in the Haight.

GRUB! And the service is pretty good too. The folks behind the counter are friendly and the beef ribs are great! I also love the fact that they've got some greens and they don't slather the ribs in BBQ sauce... they leave that up to you. And their sauces are all good. Overall a great place for BBQ, I just wish it was closer... wait no I don't, if it were I'd be there all the time!

Scenario: Done with Toronado Barleywine Festival... must have meat! Product: Wow, where do I start and end... I lived in a little suburb of Kansas City for a couple years and only one place there even began to compare to the BBQ at Minnie's. ?The best pork ribs I've ever had, tender and juicy and flavorful, were at Dinosaur's in Rochester, NY. ?So Minnie's ranks right up at the top for me. ?The corn bread is sweet and delicious. ?The red sauce is ketchup based and tangy, perfect for making a bacon explosion, while the mustard sauce has a good zip to it. ?I'm kind of a fan of mustard. ?All the meat is tender and well-flavored. ?Not overly rubbed so you don't get overwhelmed. ?Prices aren't horrendous either. Service: The food comes out amazingly fast for such tender BBQ. ?Free refills on the drinks. ?Tons of sauce at the tables. ?Really it's not about the service here but what they do have is quick. Atmosphere: Picnic tables covered with plexiglass. ?Baskets for the sandwiches. ?Silly art and t-shirts and whatnot on the walls. ?Nowhere to sit. ?No talking, only slurping sounds... ?aka awesomeness. Uniquity: Really tasty BBQ next to some cool bars in the Haight and very unique sauces in the red and the mustard. ?Now stop reading and go wrap your lips around some pork!

I've only been here once so far, but felt like it deserved a review just for the chicken. I don't know if it's offered every day, but I tried the smoked fried chicken special and it was pretty tasty! I've never had fried chicken smoked before - different but delicious and the portions were pretty big in my opinion.. The greens were ok until I reached the bottom half of the little bowl - there the greens were completely drowned in vinegar and inedible to be honest. The sweet potatoes were disappointing but edible. Cornbread - fine. "Sweet tea" was all right but nothing to write home about. I think Arizona makes a better one (you know - the tea in a really tall white can for only 99 cents at the corner store). Service was OK - I think as friendly as you're going to get from big burly white dudes all sweating in a kitchen for 8 hours or whatever. I will probably go back to try the brisket. Kind of wish they had mashed potatoes, but didn't see it on the menu.

This place brought me back to my childhood in Georgia. ?Yum. ?I got the pork sandwich and mac n cheese, which were both amazing. ?My boy got the coleslaw and the brisket, which was better. ?They have four sauces, the best of which (someone back home is gonna hate me for this) is the Texas. ?But because the meat is SO good, you don't need to overwhelm the sandwich with sauce like you sometimes do back home. ?They also have AMAZING sweet tea, so make sure to check that out. The restaurant itself is cute, though not that big, so I imagine it fills up pretty quickly. ?The guys behind the counter are super friendly and I will be back, soon, if I can help it.

HANDS DOWN THE BEST BBQ IN SF, MAYBE CALI! I live in LA and whenever we make a trip to SF, no matter what, we always stop by for a sandwhich here. So good and unique tasting, and the mustard sauce is where it's at. The guys that work there are pretty cool too. One time I went to a wedding at a vegitarian hippy buddist farm outside san fran, and we were there for a week with NO meat- only greens grown on the farm. We actually ducked out of the weddding as soon as we could and our first stop was Minnies! We were craving meat sooooo bad. Ah, this place was like a rush of blood to the head! Yummers! I am considering having my WEDDING catered by this place! lol.

This place is excellent. ?One of my few regrets from when I lived in SF (2002) is that I didn't try to work here to learn how to make BBQ. ?They get bonus points for the existence of Toronado across the street (reviewers complaining about the beer selection are missing the point), for offering sake (which is inspired) and for being a BBQ place in California that *isn't* texas-style. ?I've been back since and it seemed basically the same.

Mac & Cheese. Sweet potato pie. Pulled Pork sandwiches. Choice of different quality sides and BBQ sauces. Kitchy interior. The occasional dry order and ambivilant staff keep this from being a 5 star recommendation in my hood.

I thought I ate at Memphis Minnie's (MM) when they had a location on Polk by Russian Hill. Now I'm thinking it was just a dream because I can't find it now and for some reason I remember really liking it!! :-O Fast forward to the present . . . I have eaten at the current Haight St location 3 times and have been severely disappointed each time. The meat has always been dry, tough and not particularly flavorful. The brisket. Dry The beef ribs. Dry The pork ribs. Dry Dry BBQ != Dry Meat!! I don't know why I've gone back . . . OK I do know why. It's people raving about the place and telling me to give it another chance. I even went with a MM raver and he admitted that "it must be an off day." Apparently I always pick the off days . . . Well, 3 strikes and you're out Minnie. ?Make that 4 strikes. They catered a function at work and the food was blah there too. I'm giving it 2 stars. 1 for their present day suckage and +1 for my fond memory of the old location . . . a dining experience which may or may not have actually happened. ------------------ Update: it wasn't a dream!! There was a Polk St location!! ;-) http://www.ibiblio.org/l¡­

I will admit I'm no expert on BBQ, but I don't think this place is as fabulous as everyone says it is. ?The meat does fall off the bone - yes, but wasn't very moist. ?The sauces on the table were great, but shouldn't this place be about the meat? I shared the 2 meat choice combo, which we had brisket and pork ribs. ?Our sides were fries and mac-n-cheese. ?The sides were all right, but nothing fantastic. ?I thought the mac-n-cheese was quiet boring. ?The cornbread muffin was nice and the cornmeal gave it great texture. Perhaps going on a Sunday night isn't the best time? ?I don't know - the food didn't leave me skipping and smiling with joy.

This might be three stars if it weren't called MEMPHIS Minnie's. But it is, therefore by doing so, the owners are claiming to accomplish the extremely difficult task of replicating not just any barbecue, but the best in the world, Memphis barbecue. And they failed. The dishes were overpriced, the sweet tea wasn't sweet enough, the pork was decent texture-wise, but lacked flavor completely. The beans were veyr good, but not as amazing as what I've had in Memphis. Also, no Memphis barbecue sauce? WTF?

I guess this isn't the BEST place to go when you are on a cleansing diet *DOH*. ?Yet, even I found something on their menu to enjoy (smoked turkey). ? I've been here twice. ?Once over two years ago and once last weekend. ?Both times were enjoyable. ?The first visit, I ordered the bbq shredded pork sandwich....talk about finger lickin' good. ?This go around, I opted for the smoked turkey, which was VERY GOOD. I think that starting off with quality meat, good aging, bbq-ing technique and ultimately, seasoning and sauce makes ALL the difference when it comes to making tasty southern bbq. ?I like that this restaurant ?give you CHOICES in what to put on your meat. ?My favorite, OF COURSE, is the NC BBQ sauce. ?This is what I grew up with. ? Overall, I've been pleased. ?I was raised in North Carolina and it takes a LOT to impress me with regards to BBQ. ?So, the fact that there is a resto in SF that even offers me an option for some "down home Southern cookin'" and for some Que is great. I haven't been there with enough frequency b/c SF has so many dining options, but I think that this has been a solid place from the two times that I've been there. I went there with 3 other people (including my boyfriend) and I think that we were all pleased. ? The bill came out to be around $55 for 4 people w/o tip. ?P.S. ?Seating can be limited, parking in the area is hard to find, and it can be a long wait if you come around 7-8PM. ?They do allow take out orders and Credit Cards are accepted.

After taking a long hiatus from Minnie's, I gave it a shot again this week, and was relieved that the food was as good as it has ever been. For a while, sometimes the food seemed a little assembly-line, but yesterday, no such plight. Memphis Minnie's wont satisfy the most demanding of Southerners, as I can attest, but for those of us that long for at least an honest stab at the smoked delish of our childhood, they come pretty damn close. Barbecue was never about haute cuisine anyway, but roasting meat is definitely an art form. I've had about a dozen things on the menu over the years - some things like the pulled pork will blow your mind, and others might leave you feeling underwhelmed. Oh, and one more thing - SWEET TEA.

It's not often I throw away a 5/5 after only one visit, but after investing $10 bucks into a pulled spicy chicken sandwich, fries, and an ice-tea, its pretty obvious that these guys did their homework, and know how to serve a mean lunch.

Delicious! Atmosphere is perfect for the type of food they serve (a "Never trust a thin cook" sign is prominently displayed). ?The BBQ is of course excellent, but what also makes the place unique is their IHOP-esque selection of BBQ sauces: one that's a kind of vinaigrette, another that's a kind of mustard, and of course a classic BBQ sauce. ?Each was tasty with the dinner. Also, it may just be me, but I think they've got the syrup/fizzy water ratio perfect with their soda fountain!

The prices here are outrageously high. For $17.xx, I expected to have so much food, I'd have to take some home. For $17.xx, I got two very small (but delicious) sides, one diet coke, a dry piece of unimpressive cornbread and 6 conservative slices of brisket. The meat was tender but the taste was just alright. I preferred the sides though most people don't seem to like them. Perhaps I'd say this place was alright if it was $4.00 a plate but at $17+ for lunch, you'd better give me something to make me happy. The three bites of sweet potatoes and collard greens didn't do it. Then again, I didn't even bring the leftovers home. I walked away from 3 pieces of meat and not because I was full. I'm pretty sure I went home and ate cereal after my dismal lunch here.

Came here today for an early dinner. The service was really good. All of them were nice. However, the food was so-so. I was really looking forward to eating here, but I was a bit disappointed. The tri-tip was dry, the pork ribs weren't fall-off-the-bone tender and weren't as moist as I expected. On a good note, the brisket was delicious. I'd go back for that. The potato salad was ok. The mac and cheese was ok. The sweet tea was delicious. The sauces were ok. I liked the mustard one the most. Overall, I probably wouldn't come back here for anything other than the brisket. I suggest Rib Shack in San Bruno. A small drive from the city with parking and delicious meats. Hats off to the service, though. They clean-up after you if you dine-in. And when you try to give them the plates back, they tell you that they'll take care of it.

Most people would say since I'm a California girl born and raised I have no idea what good bbq is and this could be true, but I do know that the food we had from Minnie's was off the hook!! I know yummy when I taste it! I had some collard greens, turkey and beef brisket.

Bay Area show, so decide to give it a try, plus the 3.5 stars Yelp rating back up. This is definitely not the best neighborhood in town and parking wasn't that friendly either. ?We ordered the Two Meat samplers - picked the beef brisket and pork ribs; while for the sides we had sweet potatoes and BBQ beans.

First of all, let me just say that THIS IS NOT MEMPHIS BBQ!!! I am from 20 minutes south of Memphis in Mississippi and have eaten BBQ since, as "The Situation" would say, prehistoric kindergarten! Corky's, Stateline, Rendevous are all places that should be mimiced for their BBQ. I'm not sure which Memphis the owners are trying to say their BBQ is from but in no way shape or form is it good ole Memphis TENNESSEE! I didn't even look over the whole menu because I am a pulled pork sandwich girl. I just requested it...like I said, I didn't look over the menu so I'm not sure if it is on there. He let me pick a side, well, he SUGGESTED mac n cheese and I ok'd it. I ordered a soda...and he pointed to the soda machines. "Sweet tea is on the right of the soda," the cashier said. Wait, what? Did you just say....*the heavens open up, angels are singing* SWEET TEA?!?!?! I wanted to seriously kiss him. Anyway, ask me why I gave this place 3 stars? Well, you should know. The sweet tea, of course. Back to the BBQ. The sandwich came out...on some kind of "french" roll? What the HELL? Don't you know that pork sandwiches go on hamburger buns? If you want to name your business after a certain city, at least cook your food the way that they would cook it. Your name should be San Francisco BBQ or French BBQ or Cali BBQ...Idk but NOT Memphis BBQ. It is alwayysssssss served on a hamburger bun. Simple. The mac n cheese were huge noodles with some cheese melted on it...and I'm hoping I just got a mistake bc I had like crumbs or some shit on mine??? I choked about 6 noodles down...but had to scrap off the crumbs. Seriously, do people really put bread crumbs on their mac n cheese? NOT IN MEMPHIS.... The only reason I will be back is because I'm on Haight and I want sweet tea. Or, at least the latter. Not for the food. It was a waste of $10.

While this is by no means the best barbecue I've had (you need to go to Birmingham, AL for that), it sure as hell runs a good second. ?

Napkin-dependent, artery-clogging finger-licking delicious food. Highlights - Weekly pastrami sandwich: ?Very nice flavor, and went well on the grilled bread. ?Huge portion - Mac & Cheese: ?Very heavy, but extraordinarily cheesy. - Sampling the three BBQ sauces on everything I was eating to see what went best with what - Southern hospitality Cons - I didn't like the vinegar BBQ sauce. ?It seemed like it needed to be shook up more as there was a lot of sediment on the bottom - Lack of seating. ?Often feels crowded even though there aren't many people. - It's real BBQ and it will sit in your stomach as such. ?I probably should have eaten less than the whole portion.

Stopped in for lunch after reading some great reviews. I had the sampler with greens and mac & cheese. Very good BBQ, better than most I had on a trip to South Carolina earlier this year. Nice smoke ring ,the ribs held together until you bite into then they give way and fall of the bone. The brisket was good although a little dry.The staff was very helpful and when I said it was my first trip in, asked if they could make some recommendations. which were spot on. The sauces were very good and on the table where they belong not on the meat. When your inside this joint it's hard to believe your in San Francisco and not somewhere in the deep south.

Found myself on Haight St. attending a gala reception (kinda a funny to say so given the nature of this 'hood, and the flora and fauna that occupy this area.... ), which I thought the event would have food, but no food. Hungry, scanning the street ... there is a BBQ Joint... bright red with colorful lettering "Memphis Minnies Bar- B - Que Joint". You just can't miss it. http://maps.google.com/m¡­ Liked it. At our table: ?ribs ( a little too much fat ) very tasty, the fried chicken w/ mac n cheese, sweet potatoes ... great ! ?Chicken had a fantastic flavor of spice and somehow maybe absorbed some of the bbq smoke flavor. The mac n cheese looked kinda runny, but turned out be be very tasty, I believe like you would find in Memphis. Sweet potatoes coulda used some help with a little spice think boiling a sweet potato, chop into squares, place in bowl, eat (the good news: they have 4 bottles of hot sauce on each table) ... . Found myself lusting after the french fries that landed on the table next to us. The owner roaming around making jokes with customers many he knew by sight and then sitting down at one table that were friends /customers....I appreciate the friendly monitoring of the joint.... especially based on the 'hood. ?At first I thought he had just wondered in off the street from one of the 100 bars in that area. But after a little while, it was clear he was DA ?MAN. I failed to ask him if he is Minnie and if he really likes pigs, but then again I value my teeth. With a "pig " theme, reflected in the signage, and in a the decor and front display of an extensive collection of pigs. Not sure what this is all about, but at least they are consistent with their theme. Itsa fun place. Felt a little outa place with my gala attire, but felt welcome. I do love some connection to the past and discovered the name of the joint is paying homage: http://en.wikipedia.org/¡­

I checked this place out a few days ago after seeing all the great reviews on yelp. Having tasted bbq from some of the champs like Big Bob Gibson BBQ, i can say that Memphis Minnie's definitely holds its own. The place is a no frills, order at the counter kinda place, which is fine since no one's there for the ambiance. Our group tried out the rib tips, fried cheese grit sticks, brisket, pulled pork and St.Louis style ribs, andouille sausage and sides of mac and cheese, coleslaw, and just for good measure... the fried peach pies and banana pudding. In general everything was great, my only disappointment was the mac and cheese....not very cheesy, a little on the mushy side. Besides that, a great overall first impression. The service is great and speedy and the place has a cool quirky style that works well. Would definitely recommend.

I have been wanting to come here for a while and I finally made it here today. I think the impression I got from this place is that it is good BBQ for someone that has never had good BBQ before. But for me, with my fair amount of experience with good BBQ, this is just average BBQ. My girlfriend and I both got the pork sandwich. The pork wasn't dry but it wasn't especially moist either. The slaw was nothing special (not creamy enough) and the sauces weren't great either. The North Carolina sauce (vinegar) was too watery, the Texas sauce (regular BBQ sauce) was too sweet, and the South Carolina Sauce was good, but not something I generally want on my pork. I found a decent mix with the North Carolina + Texas sauce. The mac and cheese was decent but unspectacular. In general the sides were too small and the food was overpriced ($7.50 for sandwich + small side). I'd give this place 2.5 stars if I could, but even after all I complained about above I would say that I did enjoy my lunch, so it gets 3 stars instead of 2.

2 appetizers and a dinner were $30. ?:-( Memphis Minnies makes a pretty decent potato salad. Of course, I didn't order potato salad, I ordered cole slaw take-out. But when I opened the bag at home, there was the potato salad. The fried cheese grit sticks are pretty darn good. They're fried, how can you go wrong? We ordered the 2 meat dinner. The guy at the counter said that wouldn't be enough for 2 people, but it was waaay enough food. The beef rib was tender and good. The tri-tip was fine. The pork rib appetizer was fine. However, a big ?reason one goes to a barbeque joint is for their signature sauces. One of the sauces they gave me was a thin, tangy, mild vinegar sauce. The other was a tangy, thin, mild mustard vinegar sauce. Sound similar? They were. :-( Both lacked depth and subtlty. There were no hot, spicy, mild, or sweet sauces. Curiously, all the meat came only with a dry rub. There was no sauce except for what was in the little containers. Not liking any of their sauces, I made my own.

I took my roommate and friend Shane to Memphis Minnie's for his birthday dinner. At first we wanted chicken and waffles, but that place was closed - so BBQ was naturally a close second. The decor there is fun, with signs like "HIPPIES, OVER THERE!" As we were coming in, this 8 year old girl shared her drawing with us. It was a picture of a sad pig with the caption, "You're so cute, but you're so tasty too!" Aw, how sweet. We split a half pound of pork ribs, a half pound of briskets, and a basket of fries - and while we finished it all, it definitely could have comfortably fed three (or four small children). For the amount we paid, we got a great amount of food, and tasty too. The sauces there were kind of funky. One of the BBQ sauces reminded me of Indian food - not a bad thing, just something peculiar. The portly fellows working there were fun people and really friendly. I don't know often I will eat BBQ, but Memphis Minnie's is definitely cool in my book. Oh yeah, the employees there wanted me to tell you guys that they do delivery now - Sick!

I really like their Brisket. The sauce is OK., but the meet is really tender. I also love looking at all the pig figures they have displayed all over the place. It's fun for the kids as well. Another item I love here is the smoked salmon. It is sooo flaky and moist, just the way it should be. Better than that is the andouille sausage...umm! The best!!

WARNING FOR TO GO ORDERS: THEY BOGART THE SAUCE!!!! If you are the kind of customer who asks for extra sauce.... BEWARE! I have ordered to go from these guys repeatedly. I always ask for "Only beelzebub sauce ... give me EXTRA ?sauce" Unless I open the bag in front of me, they always only give me about 8 tablespoons of sauce (4 TB per container x2 ). Total cheap ass BS. If you want a decent amount of a specific sauce, open your bag in front of them before leaving to humilate them into giving them what you deserve and/or squeeze some of the bottle into your container. DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT CHECKING YOUR BAG FOR SAUCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Shame that they do not listen to the customers orders. When a customer asks for extra sauce, you give him a quarter cup or maybe even a half a cup. This crap can be expected when you are a mediocre bbq place in a sea of terrible bbq places.

As many have said, meat good! It's my 2nd time there, but first as a yelper. The meat in the sandwiches is very good, but what really makes the experience is there mustard based sauce. ?Delicious! ?Also tried the slaw, which is a different approach from your traditional slaw. ?Has almost a vinaigrette dressing rather than mayonnaise based. ?Tasty, but I think I'll stick to the normal slaw from now on. One quirk that gave us a good laugh. ?They have a sign up inside advertising a sunday brunch (bbq + brunch... hmmm?) and I guess they've stopped doing it, but instead of taking down the sign they just taped a big red cross over it. ?Guess someone must have been very attached to that sign.

Oh my god, everything was so delicious! All of the sides were superb. The coleslaw was fresh and crispy and tangy and NOT full of mayo. The beans were phenomenal, and so were the fries. I didn't try the cornbread, but my kid told me it was the "best cornbread ever." Price very reasonable. Service very friendly. I had the special, which was rib tips with two sides (I got the beans and fries) and a hunk of cornbread. The portions are generous, and it was only $8.95 for the whole delicious plate! My husband got the Texas brisket sandwich with coleslaw. Nom nom nom

Order the brisket! ?Its my favorite brisket in the city. ?Lily's is ok but too fatty and tough for me. ?Memphis Minnie's brisket is tasty and melts in your mouth. ?Ribs however I prefer Lily's which always causes a problem. ?I end up getting ribs from Lily's with two sides and cake and then go over to Memphis and get brisket with two sides and then pass out on the couch with my cat chomping on the ribs. ?Its delicious but definitely a night ender. ?Although I did manage to get up after 5 hours and go see Rebirth Brass Band at the Independent. ?Its a miracle that even happened. ? I do need to say something though. ?All the pig decor freaks me out. ?I like pigs, they are cute! ?They used to be my favorite animal and I refused to eat them but then my mouth got a taste of Carnitas and it was over. ?Pig for life! ?But, do you want to stare at a cute little pig while you're eating it, not so sure.

Decent solid BBQ in a city not known for it's BBQ other than that of the Korean or Brazilian kind (and even then, not so much). ?I've been there a couple of times now and while certainly not the worst BBQ I've had (that honor currently goes to some BBQ joint at DFW airport...seriously, DFW? ?I'm in freakin' TEXAS and you can't get a good BBQ place in your airport?), it does make me wish I had easier access to my old place in Atlanta. I've had the pulled pork, in sandwich form, and the brisket, in plate form. ?The pulled pork is pretty good, tender and juicy enough, though it still requires a bit of splash of sauce to help moisten it up. ?Unfortunately, tonight's brisket was quite literally half hit, half miss. ?The slices that had a good bit of fat fell apart at a touch and melted in my mouth. ?The other slices looked like they had previously had the fat there, but either it was all cooked out or this was an old brisket that had been left to dry, as the meat was dry and flaky...and very much not in a good way. Other downside, is that the wait can seem to be rather long, which is a little annoying considering that most of this stuff is already cooked and done. ?Sure, you might have to slice up some brisket, but does slicing up brisket and scooping out some sides and picking up a cornbread muffin really take 20 minutes? So for the wait, and time, down a star from 4 to 3, but props to making me occasionally wish I was living back in the south...if only just for the food.

The sweet tea is absolutely perfect. I should know. A few dishes are not *entirely* Southern, but probably altered just a bit to be less threatening to the West Coast palate. I forgive the nice people at Memphis Minnie's, as I understand their need to appeal to everyone. The staff is very friendly, too - the way it should be in a BBQ joint.

Today ?I learned what southern hospitality is. I have to say I'm a fan. It's not very often that I go to barbecue joints, but going to Memphis Minnie's is making me think I should a bit more often. Where ever I go, I take the atmosphere into account, and to put it simply Memphis Minnie's is very pleasant. They greeted me with a hello and a smile, and were even kind to me as I stumbled through my order (I have a bad habit of going to the cashier without knowing what I want.) My smoked Texan beef brisket was tasty though lacking that special something. I should have thought to use one of the barbecue sauces available at the table. Though the decor is like a watered down Bennigan's (flair, now in wall format) I found myself comfortably chewing away and soaking everything in. Definitely somewhere to return to and try more of their menu.

I was really pumped to come to Memphis Minnie's because of its rep. It looked pretty legit, with the fun, funky decor as well as the freshly baked corn muffins still in their sheets...mmm. In my party, we had the crispy fried onion strings ($5), a two-meat combo of brisket and ribs ($17), a tri-tip sandwich ($10), and a fried chicken meal, around $12. For sides, we got an assortment of mac 'n' cheese, greens, and beans. I was expecting something special, and unfortunately it was a letdown. The meats were good, solid, but nothing special. The onion strings were delicious and well seasoned, perfectly cooked. That's the only reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 2. The side were a huge letdown. The corn muffins that looked so fresh were hella mushy and spongey. The collard greens were bland but had way too much vinegar, they were sour as hell. The mac and cheese was cold and had a weird, sharp taste to it. The baked beans were ok, but how do you mess those up. IMO, the sides are just as important as the barbecue itself--so I won't be coming back.

This place really isn't worthy of all the hype (I certainly hope this isn't actually the best BBQ in the city..). Their ribs were fatty and nothing special (in fact I left most of them on my plate due to their flabbines). T he macaroni and cheese was room temperature, greasy, and flavorless. The tart 'n tangy slaw was descent but I could definitely live without it. Their bbq sauces were alright but not my thing. Basically everything I had was leagues under what I was expecting and I will not be returning. 2.5 stars - I really hope I just went on a terribly off day..

Wickedly good BBQ, super friendly service and piggily wiggilies everywhere. What more do you need? We had the brisket, smoked pork and rib tips. All were excellent. There were three tasty sauces on the table along with a roll of taper rolls. I highly recommend the pit smoked beans. You order up front and likewise pick up your BBQ there when they call out for you. The guy helping us was hilarious. The music playing was..

The neighborhood is dodgy, the joint divey and some of the customers questionable. ?If you enjoy or can disregard the ambience, it's a reasonable BBQ joint. Order at the counter. I tried: ?the beef ribs, the hot links, the mac & cheese, the corn bread and the baked beans. The beef ribs were smoked and a little dry. ?Nothing to write home about and definitely not drip-off-the-bone tender. ?Perhaps I prefer braising or other cooking methods. ?The hot links were good and spicy. ?The mac & cheese was baked in a small cub and delicious. ?The corn bread and baked beans were fairly standard. In all, I just don't love the area, and the food was rather average.

Why do I still convince myself every so often that "maybe, just maybe this time it will be good" when it's always just dry, bland, and smeared with room-temperature BBQ sauce hours after the meat finished cooking. ?

Reading some of the reviews, I really wasn't sure what to expect when I came here. ?Some love it and some hate it. ?It could be that Memphis is inconsistent??? ? Well, for my group, we all pretty much were highly disappointed. ?Of course 4 out of the 6 in the party went to Kinder's in Reno about a month before our visit here so we had pretty high standards. ?Kinder's was infinitely better than Memphis... ?The texture of the meat, the sauce... ?Just about anything you could think of would be better. ? But even if we did not go to Kinder's, we certainly would have had the same opinion that Memphis, on our visit, was extremely substandard. ?It may be good on some days but I don't think I could ever go back to take a chance that they are having a good day. ?I will just have to visit another place to go "take a chance"... ?Sooner the better... ?Had a craving for BBQ on the day we went and had a STRONGER Craving afterwards because it was so bad...

Eh. Not bad, but not great either. The pulled pork didn't taste smoky - it tasted more like it had been cooked with propane. Ew. The sides were also kinda yucky (the mac and cheese especially!), with the exception of the baked beans which are really great. I've had both Memphis and Carolina-style BBQ and this just didn't do it for me.

If you like perfectly cooked meat that has not been seasoned, then this is your place. The boy and I went there for lunch today and were both extremely disappointed. We tried the brisket, tri-tip, and ribs. The texture of all the meat was very good - obviously slow cooked and smoked. But, the dry rubs left a LOT to be desired, and we didn't like any of the sauces on the table. The sides did not help at all. Mac and cheese was tasteless, greens and slaw were swimming in vinegar, corn muffin was tough and chewy. We didn't get fries, but they did look tasty on other people's plates. Stick to the meat options, and bring your own bbq sauce!

I had really high hopes for this southern BBQ joint. ?A bits in the seedy area of the Haight but nonetheless, the food isn't worth traveling for, or even walking a few blocks for. We ordered a lot of food to share - the pork ribs, beef ribs, and brisket. Each entree comes with 2 sides each so we tried all the sides: chard, sweet potatoes, corn bread, mac and cheese, potato salad, and coleslaw. We also got a huge plate of BBQ seasoned fries and fried corn fritters. The pork ribs were good and at least tender. The beef ribs were charred and totally overcooked. I felt like I had to chew on a piece about 50 times before it was manageable to swallow. The brisket was dry. All the sides were really unimpressive. We all agreed the best thing on the menu was the fried corn fritters and the ranch sauce that came with it. Anchor and Sierra on tap so that was a plus. Due to the meal being so mediocre, we didn't want to waste anything on dessert.

3 1/2 stars, rounded up Ordered take-out for lunch: Memphis smoked pulled pork sandwich, sweet cornbread muffin side, a slice of pecan pie and some sweet tea. Yummy sammich. I can imagine it would have tasted better piping hot. Really good smoky flavor and not dry like I feared. I love love love that mustard BBQ sauce. Really good acidity. I need to buy a bottle of it some time. I should have added some of the Beelzebub's hot sauce before leaving. The meat could have used just a pinch of a spicy kick. The bun itself was cored out to hold more meats but was therefore also more prone to spillage. I wish the bread was a little more substantial. I wasn't wild about the cornbread muffin, but it was decent. I hope it tastes different when it's fresh out of the oven, because mine was dry. Minnie's pecan pie, though, was soooooo delicious. I wish I bought a whole pie. The sweet tea was very sweet, maybe too sweet for most folks. It reminded me of sago at gulaman (palm sugar water drink with tapioca pearls). For my purposes (Lower Haight destination for the rare workday lunch expedition) I think I'd rather make the long lunch trek to Rosamunde's for a Tuesday burger, but I'd be willing to go back and try it again to give a more well-rounded appraisal.

Wow - our new favorite BBQ place! ?We both had the beef brisket - it was tender and slightly smokey. ?It's served dry the way we like it so you can add your own BBQ sauce. ?But while it's served dry it's anything but dry - it's really moist and tasty. ?I ate half of mine without any sauce at all. ?They had a red sauce (medium heat), Beelzebub sauce (label said "Stupid Hot" but I think it was only medium-high hot), and a Vinegar sauce (didn't do much for me). Entrees come with a corn muffin and two sides. ?We both choose Mac & Cheese which was some of the best Mac & Cheese we've ever had. ?Our only complaint is that it was so good we would have loved more. ? I had the smokey beans which we're very good and my partner had the seasoned fries. The corn muffin wasn't good, but it wasn't bad. ?It good have benefited from a slab of butter. ?(Note to Memphis Minnie's - check out the corn bread at Home Restaurant - that's the kind you need!). Prices were very reasonable. ? Your order from the counter and they ask that you don't sit down until after you order. ?The place was crowded but we shared a table with another couple which was fine. All in all it was great and we'll be back! ?Definitely one of the best BBQ places in SF.

Meh. The barbeque was just okay. The experience started off with a hipster cashier's smart ass remark when I asked him.."What are the specialities?" and he said, "Barbeque." The meat on the ribs was fall-off-the-bone only because it was super dried out. The tri-tip was just okay, the pulled pork was just right. However, the sauces just plain sucked. Too Thin. Not one that you can say you like over the other...the Texas sauce had cumin in it so it tasted like it had an Indian food taste to it. ?Really..just okay.

I hadn't been in this place since it was the Spaghetti Western back when the Lower Haight was still relatively cool. I can tell you, I won't return here unless I'm forced. I ordered a combo sandwich (half pork/half brisket). I'd recommend that you stick to the brisket only. The pulled pork was so over done that it looked and tasted like pre-chewed food for senior citizens with no teeth. The brisket was pretty good, but everything was cold--both meats. The greens (a side dish) was cloying--what ever it was they add to it, I hope was just a mistake--tasted like someone dropped a Mr Pibb in to the collards. The service was brusque but ok. I asked for an extra plate, the guy grabbed one, dropped it at the other side of the counter and told me it's over there as he walked past me. For some reason he couldn't hand it directly to me.

This little dog is from the south, the Florida Panhandle to be exact, so I know good barbecue when I see, smell and taste it. Minnie's has the best ?barbecue that I have had in San Francisco--but I have definitely had better. I guess that the all them Clean Air laws you'all have here in the Bay Area keeps them from really smokin' the barbecue as good as we do back home. The main complaint that we have (after eating here twice) is that the french fries have entirely too much seasoning on them. And a nice, sweet type barbecue sauce would be an good addtion to the present sauces that are available. And those buns used for the hamburgers are awful tough; though the hamburgers are really good. You can also get your barbecue "by the pound" on your way home or for a picnic. We prefer the pulled pork.

The meat on the two dishes I shared with a friend was dry. ? They don't have enough sauces on the tables. ?Two - really? ? Only two sauces? The greens weren't half bad - well flavored. The pecan pie - one of the best I've ever had. ? The corn muffins - pretty ok. ? The prices were a bit steep for the quality of food. ? I feel bad saying this, but Famous Dave's (a BBQ chain primarily existent on the east coast) is better than Memphis Minnie's. ?Then again, Famous Dave's is one of the best managed chain's in the country.

We are only rating the Mac and Cheese here.... I heard the mac and cheese was suppose to be awesome. ?So we ordered it togo and took it across the street to noc noc. ?And it was just all night...plain jane mac and cheese, a lil dried out and not as cheesy as i would except a southern place to be...i wanted to have a heart attack....from all the fat and cheese but didn't...i probally would order it again though cause it was still very tasty but just not what i expected.

I've wanted to try out Memphis Minnie's ever since I got hellbent on having ribs one day in January (after a 10 year bbq hiatus, which was broken at Asqew, more on that later...). I had high hopes. I was excited. I was ready gorge on meat. I really wanted to try the Texas beef ribs, but they ran out. The cashier was friendly and made suggestions for other beef related dishes, but I ended up ordering the St.Louis pork ribs instead. The sides are surprisingly small, they put them in those little cups that are sometimes used to hold sauce or dressing. The corn bread was pretty good, I wish it was warm though. As for the ribs, I got a pretty large portion. Unfortunately several of the ribs were really dried out and tough making them inedible. The ribs that weren't dried out were pretty good, but not amazing. I had really high hopes for Memphis Minnie's, but I must say I was let down : [ If you're seeking out good barbecue, Asqew Grill on upper Haight has way better fall-off-the-bone ribs and larger sides.

Beef brisket is gooood. Everything else is ok. I can't believe so many people gave this place a 5 star. This is not a 5 star place and I am not talking about only fancy places deserve 5 stars; 5 stars is about overall experience. Mac and Cheese side dish was better than average yet too soft. Ribs were not that great; Houston's has much better ribs even Outback. Chicken was ok. The place has a cool vibe to it with all the cheesy pig memorabilia, but as a whole the place didn't quite cut it for me.

I love this place. ?The Southern Star, the Brisket, the Pastrami (only on Wednesdays), the Burger (yes that's right, I know it's almost a crime to order a burger at a BBQ joint, but trust me - it's delicious!), the greens, the fries, the slaw, the potata salad... I could go on. ?In 3 years of frequenting this spot, I've never had a bad meal. ? The thing that gets me is that the meat has that authentically smoky taste that BBQ should have. ?BBQ isn't about the sauce. ?(Although their sauces are super yummy and difficult to pass up.) ?The staff is always extremely friendly and personable. ?Let me say it again, I love this place.

5 stars for the beef brisket and beef ribs ONLY!!! -2 stars for the disgusting sides and unimpressive sauces -2 for rude customer service Customer service is so bad here that it's appalling! ?My friend sat down at an open table while I was at the cash register ordering our food and he was actually KICKED OUT of his seat because we hadn't received our food yet!! ?Yes I understand that the seating is somewhat limited and they want to make sure that people with food in their hands have somewhere to sit... HOWEVER.... the owner of this place actually walked up to my friend in front of several other patrons and scolded him for saving a seat! ?This wasn't just rude and poor tact, it was very embarrassing to be singled out and kicked out of our seats in front of a restaurant full of other people. ?NOT COOL The side dishes are simply not good. ?In fact, the mac n' cheese is one of the worst I have ever tried. ?Generic boxed Safeway mac n' cheese is 10x better. ?Off texture, off flavors..just not good! ?The coleslaw is awful. ?Chopped up cabbage and carrots mixed with a weird vinegary, sugary mixture.

I had had real southern BBQ at it's best. ?The type that is slow smoked over mesquite for hours that the mean is so juicy that it falls off the bone, and this is not it. ?The sauce is awful. ?It ruined that smoked taste of the meat. ?Actually I really could not even taste the meat because there was way to much icky sauce poured all over it. ? I wished they would change their sauce to a more smoky sauce with less sweet icky taste. ?After that first time, I won't go back. ?I'll stick to the traditional whole in the wall style Southern Soul Food places over the pretentious Yuppie place on Haight.

Yeah I hated it. Just plain BBQ, dont get the hype. Lived near Santa Maria CA home of the Tri-Tip cut they made good BBQ. This might be okay for city folks who have never had the real deal or who do not have a BBQ pit of their own. Personally I would rather go to Chili's. I also found a bit of bone in my pork sandwich.

I really wanted to love this place since I live two blocks away and I've been searching for a good BBQ place in SF, but I found it extremely disappointing (twice)... The first time I went I was craving a big juicy burger, instead I got an overcooked tasteless burger with nothing else but the meat. ?So the second time I decided to give this place another chance by trying their infamous BBQ ribs: again they were overcooked and the sauce wasn't very tasty. ?They have a catchy logo and a hipster setting but the food is overpriced and not that good.

Walk in here and the smell of BBQ scent is everywhere. A interesting place with lots of piggy memorabilia and hogs perhaps? This was my second stop after coming across the street from a sausage eatery. I got a 2 way combo to go and decided to order the pork ribs and chicken. It came with my choice of season fries and coleslaw. Quickly got home and open the box and it smell great and tasted the seasoned fries and thought it was OK, a little soggy, but was a huge order. The pork ribs consist of 3 average size portion and was good on smokey BBQ flavor, but was too dry from over smoking ? Defiantly not moist at all. The smoked chicken was disappointed because it was 1/2 of a small breast and a small wing portion, not what I was expecting for $16.95. Corn muffin was good and coleslaw was ok. ?I might go back to give them a try again if I'm in the area again.

When we first arrived, I thought it looked and smelled just like a good, no frills BBQ place I would find in Texas. ?When I asked the guy taking my order if the brisket sandwich came sliced or chopped, he asked me if I was from the Lone Star State. ?It turns out he was from Texas as well. ?To my dismay, the sandwich only came sliced, but I ordered it anyway. ?We had a large group and it was crowded, so we had to huddle near the bathroom until a table was available. ?It wasn't a problem since we had a pitcher of beer to help pass the time. ?I give them an A+ for southern hospitality. ?One guy even iced a few pint glasses for us so we wouldn't have to drink our beer from warm glasses straight from the dishwasher. ?Nice job. I have to say I was a little disappointed with the sandwich. ?First of all, it came on a French baguette. ?Also, the sandwich came sans sauce, you had to add the sauce yourself at the table. ?I'm of the persuasion that BBQ sandwiches should come smothered in sauce - you should get dirty eating them. ?But the brisket itself was very good. ?And the fries were great. ?I would probably go back again, I'll be trying the homemade cornbread muffins next.

this place is way over rated. all these yelpers who praise this place must have not had good bbq before. To start off the food here is not even that good. One thing i would say that is good is the bbq sauce. As for the meat its just average and for sure not amazing. The service here i would say sucks hands down. Did i forget to mention that it is crazy overpriced. Man the sandwiches here are tiny. It was my first time trying this place and i was sadly disappointed. The food comes out basically room temperature and its not even hot. I ordered and waited for a my food quite a while and the thing that pissed me off was they forgot my sides. I called back 5 mins after leaving the store and told them and asked them to bring it to me because i did not want to walk back. Then the girl who told me over the phone sorry we dont have anyone who can deliver it to you. Wtf?? im two blocks away and you guys messed up my order the least you can do it fix it by bringing it to me. If you cant deliver take it off your menu because thats just false advertising. The food here is not worth the wait. This is the last time i would ever eat at this place there are plenty of other bbq joints around the city that have much better food and friendlier service. THIS PLACE SUCKS

dry, dry, dry. The beef ribs were chewy and dry and the pork ribs were the same. The sweet pork was the only item that was savory. Not a place to dine in unless you want to fight for a seat. A lot of the patrons ignore the rule of ordering then wait to get a table. If I do go back, I'm going to march right up to an empty seat and save it, then get back in line to order. I'm not a pro at bbq'n but I surely can do it better. There are alot of better bbq places, but unfortunately most are located in the East Bay, if you want to cross the bridge.

I had high hopes for this place, but the food ended up being pretty bland. The side of beans was the only redeeming quality. Also, for the price, I was expecting much bigger portions. I would've liked to try a sandwich but they were out of bread. This place might have earned 3 stars in another city, but in San Francisco when the amazing food choices are plentiful, I can't really see myself going back here.

Been here twice and had both great experiences. IMO, it is some of the best BBQ i can get in SF. Best part is that its across the street from Toronado, one of my favorite pub/tap houses. I seem to always get there brisket sandwich, which is to die for. The smoker and/or sauce they use brings out more of a sweet zesty and slight spice BBQ flavor that I totally dig. I should defiantly try out there specials, seems they got alot to offer on a daily basis. Cheers!

I'm a regular at Minnie's. I normally would have given it four stars but my meal yesterday was very disappointing. I asked for a lean cut of brisket -- the cashier repeated this back to me in order to indicate understanding, at least you'd think, right? So finally our order is called and I can't wait to dig in. I put that first mouthful in to find out that the meat is extremely (1) fatty, and (2) room temperature. I truly hate to send things back, but after a few bits I really couldn't stand it. I told the guy behind the counter (VERY politely) that the meat was really cold and also I had asked for a leaner slice. Then the other woman behind the counter goes "yeah... we were calling your number like 5 times, of course it's cold." She acted like we purposely let it get cold so we could have the privilege of complaining? It was just so obnoxious, really made my meal a lot less enjoyable. They replaced it with another cut of brisket that was much leaner and warmer but still not that warm! How hard is it to keep the meat warm!? Anyone else had any lousy experiences like this?

Where can you go in the city for some really good BBQ? Memphis Minnies on Haight. I always order the St. Louis Style Smoked Pork Ribs plate with my two sides (mac n cheese and pit smoked beans) and a side of cornbread. When ordering, be careful not to get distracted by the tantalizing pecan pie or fried peach pie. You will roll out of this place stuffed by just eating the dinner alone. I highly recommend drenching your ribs in the Texas Red sauce that is so generously placed in a bottle on each table. And if you are vegetarian, no worries. The mac n cheese is good enough on its own. This place is fun to eat in at. Honky Tonk music plays in the background and the staff is funny and super friendly. They know and love their BBQ! Not convinced? There are plenty of awards on the wall that prove that this place is the best BBQ in the city. The only reason why Memphis Minnies doesn't get a full five stars from me is because parking sucks in the Haight. Plan accordingly. Don't wait until you are starved and craving BBQ. Allow yourself a little extra time to cash in on that parking karma. Yee Haw!

Now listen here. I'm a big fan of barbecue. I can smell barbecue anywhere for up to two blocks. For that reason, I'm a wreck whenever I'm in Lower Haight. I gotta say, Memphis Minnies has some good slow-cooked, fall-apart pork. But jeez, bbq'ers, for something as down home and gritty as a good barbecue, why pack in that San Francisco pretense? I guess Memphis Minnies doesn't believe in good old American St. Louis style wet barbecue (is that why Memphis is in the name?). Who cares if I like barbecue sauce on my barbecued food? I like barbecue sauce on my cereal! To their credit, they do offer a few delicious, and unique, condiments for your otherwise dry bbq sandwich. Otherwise, well, they don't call it dry rub barbecue for nothin'. I wish there were more options for barbecue in San Francisco. There's nothing like a good sweet and salty tri-tip sandwich on a hot Saturday. Memphis Minnie's pulls through in a pinch. I'd go so far as to say they are the best barbecue available out of the shallow BBQ pit that is San Francisco.

Memphis Minnie's just may be the best BBQ on the north side of Haight Street between Steiner and Fillmore, but that's about it. All the trappings of a meat friendly dining experience. It's got big rolls of paper towels for slopping up your spills. ?It's smoky, that's good, right? -- I liked the food. I had the brisket; yummy - but hungry for a good sauce. The sides, Mac & Cheese, greens, sweet potatoes - were all good. The flaky crust on the pecan pie alone will bring me back. I think Ms. Minnie may need to make a bigger commitment to her BBQ if she wants a special footprint in the BEST SF BBQ sweepstakes. They can have the fourth star on this review as soon as they take the burgers off the menu, really. (Rule #1 about BBQ: It should be all they do! If you can get a cheeseburger it's not a real BBQ place.)

I drive 50 miles round-trip just to eat here. I have to say this is one of the best barbecue joints I've discovered yet (but of course there's better) . Flavorful meats, endless entrees to choose from, and they sell SAKI. I never thought I'd experience such a thing but yes, they offer a variety of Saki and other alcoholic drinks to go with your meal. I usually order a whole barbecue chicken with a side of sweet yams, macaroni and cheese, and 3 sides of cornbread. Glutinous you say? I've gotta make the drive worthwhile somehow!

A big problem with BBQ in the west is that everyone wants it slathered in sweet ketchup (more or less). This is because they have never experienced the joy of slow-roasted meat. That is, a pork shoulder roasted for 16 hours or a piece of brisket-slow cooked and smoked for ?20. Meat cooked this way doesn't need sauce because it is cooked so that it retains natural juices and fat. Overzealous texans ruined BBQ for everyone with their attitude that more fire == better. This is a culinary fallacy and must be considered when shopping for BBQ. At Minnie's, the staff is saucy but the food is not. The meat comes out without sauce, and it doesn't need any - it is slow cooked, succulent, moist, BBQ heaven. You won't need a knife either - the meat is tender, and pulls apart easily with a fork. I had the brisket and the pork, with a side of collards. All three were amazing. I was born (and raised) in NC, and grew up eating slow-cooked, southern BBQ, and you will be hard-pressed to find better 'cue on this side of the world. Seating is tight, but the staff does a good job of making sure everyone finds their way to a table. My only complaint would be about the indecisive fools ahead of me in line, but there isn't much the restaurant can do about that? Pick a meat and take a seat!

If you're one of the, "I'm from the deep south and this isn't real BBQ" people; honestly, what did you expect? ?Do you know what city you're in or did a tornado carry you here while you were sleeping? ? I was raised mostly on Texas style BBQ, and this is different to be sure, but still very good and not exorbitantly priced in my opinion. This is San Francisco by the way, so just give thanks that you found some familiar cuisine, (on Haight of all places) and try to enjoy your ribs or what have you. ?I don't eat pork, but everything I do eat here (beef ribs, brisket, chicken etc.) is really pretty excellent. ? It's also nice that you can get a pitcher of beer as well as a flight of sake with your meal. ?They have some very tasty varieties and the sake BBQ thing is actually quite delicious. ?Just another unique, very un-southern characteristic of this distinctly Californicated BBQ joint. ? Yes, the sauces are a bit weird. ?So are some of the sides, but the cornbread and sweet potatoes are great. ?I don't care much for fries, but theirs are interesting. ?The banana pudding, which I generally don't care for at all, is incredible there. Oh, and they'll sell you one rib too. ?They won't pour some soda into your hands or break a hundred, but they will sell you just one rib. I have enjoyed several regional variations of "authentic" BBQ, and while this place is definitely non-traditional, I think it still qualifies since the meat is smoked and slow cooked. ?It isn't like they bake their ribs or anything. ? Think about it this way; what would I do if I found a falafel cart in the middle of ?Dixieland? ?Complain because the hummus is too dry and my pita has sesame seeds on it? ? It's a fucking falafel in Dixieland. Tell you what, if you're nice, I'll fry you up a catfish sandwich at my apartment just up the block. ?I'll use an "authentic" southern catfish. It's a Jewish catfish sandwich though, so it comes with swiss on marbled rye with a kosher dill and a pickled tomato. ? Plus you get your choice of egg, potato or macaroni salad as a side.

Who would have thought? Good barbecue in San Francisco. The first place that I have found here that is better than something of the same style back home (Philly). Half of the staff are really nice, the other half are really rude...but the good kind of rude that is endearing and just comical enough to not make me angry. I've gotten the brisket almost every time I have been here because it is really, really good. Also, they have the top 10 best mac & cheese I've ever had. The banana pudding is pretty nice too. I also enjoy the drawings and stuff on the table because it gives you something to look at while you wait. It's kinda expensive ($20+ a person) but it's a ton of food and I've never finished the full meal, it's just too much. I would advise getting the sandwich for half the price, it's more than enough food and makes it way cheaper. I usually get that every Sunday and watch some football and feel manly.

Memphis Minnie's was a bit of a paradox to me. How is it possible for such a dry rib to have meat that falls right off the bone being the biggest one? I'd almost have to dub this the Reggie Jackson of BBQ places. It swings big, and that means when it connects the ball goes a long way. And when it misses, it falls flat on its face. Unfortunately, what it missed most on when my girlfriend and I went was the meat. The ribs were tender, but very dry, and the flavor was okay but not the best. The brisket was a little dry as well. The cornbread was so overcooked that it was nearly inedible, and the Mac and Cheese didn't have any cheese taste to it, and quite frankly the baked beans were just baked beans. There were redeeming factors though--the fries, the banana pudding and the sauces. I made the mistake of ordering a large fries. I say mistake because my girlfriend and I were sad that we couldn't even finish half of them. The seasoning on top was great. And I don't think it would've been possible for me to eat the banana pudding faster. The sauces were the real key, as they almost singlehandedly saved the meat. If they could've covered up the texture and the dryness a little more, this rating may have been higher. All in all, I probably will go back if I'm in the City. In spite of the two stars, there are things I'd like to mange upon again.. My guess is the place is inconsistent, and I'd like to catch them on a good night..

I guess it's good but you got be aware of what you're ordering. I'm not well versed in meat lingo so I'm more a fan of the side dishes but eating a big bowl of beans isn't really substantial for dinner. It's nice that they have sauces on the tables to allow customers to pick and choose what they want. But I don't like having to constantly soak my sandwich in sauce to give it some flavor and texture. Otherwise, the sandwich is very dry. I don't know, I'm not really a big meat eater so this place probably isn't for me. But I am a BIG fan of their banana pudding. Real bananas, whipped cream and nila wafers! So it's not a complete waste to go there.

Yea, this place is good. Very good. Once you walk in, nice atmosphere and first thing I noticed was the bottles of sauce for your food. I am a sauce guy, I love to slather sauce on anything. BBQ, Ketchup, Salsa Verde and pretty much anything liquid. I order my pork/ beef for a reasonable price, around $10 and proceded to douse my meat with sauce. Boy was that good. Finished up my platter and saw "Corn Bread," I'm not a big fan of it, but I decided to try it. It blew my mind, I went back and bought 2 more. Love the bits of corn and the freshness of the bread.

Am I missing something? While the service was great, most of the meats were dry and tough. We ordered brisket, chicken wings, ribs, rib tips, andouille sausage, tri-tip, and some sides. And out of all that, the best were chicken wings, rib tips, and the tri-tip. If this is supposed to be the best BBQ in California/San Francisco, then I won't be eating at any other random BBQ spots any time soon. But to be fair, it could have been an off night where the mood seemed super depressing because of the dry meats and mellow music. With this many great reviews, I can't just write this place off after one try. Especially since their chicken wings were so friggin tasty. I could've had a bucket more of those things. YUM! Regardless of the dry meats, the night still ended with smiles. One of the workers opened the bathroom door to the whole restaurant while a guy was peeing and forgot to lock the door. The end :)

Walk into Memphis Minis BBQ joint and look on the walls before you order and you'll find certificates and degrees from completed BBQ courses. You have to be serious about BBQ to sit through entire courses on the subject, and you can bet your ass that these guys are. Unfortunately, I have never consumed the food sober, they are located across the street from my second home, The Toronado, so I get the food to go most of the time and make everyone inside the Toronado hungry when they smell the goodness. The best thing on the menu is the Brisket, which I always order by the pound. However, you need to ask what part of the brisket your going to get because sometimes you get a lot of the fat cap. The sauces are mouthwatering, the tangy flavor of the Texas sauce is excellent and brings out the smokey flavor of the meat. The best side is the cornbread because the grainy texture is perfect for scooping up sauce. The mac and cheese noodles are too large and the coleslaw is mayo free so I stay away from those sides. Great place, I need to try it sober one time.

I went to Memphis Minnie's for the first time. ?It was nothing special about the BBQ. ? I had better BBQ here in San Francisco. ?The price was too expensive for just a sandwich. ?I will not go back there again . ?Thank you.

I have v. fond memories of brunch at Memphis Minnie's, but it seems that's all they will ever be. ?Brunch is no longer offered and it is a sad, sad testament to the times. ?If anyone reading this has any kind of power there, please, I beg of you, bring breakfast back.

I liked the greens, but couldn't eat a lot of them because they were really sour. The beans were excellent. Cole slaw was good. The cornbread was edible. I didn't like any of the sauces. The meat was good, but kind of dry. I tried the brisket and the pork ribs. I went because of a review in Details magazine.... but Details lied.

I believe the hype... and the brisket chili cheese fries are the best chili fries I've ever had.....and I've had 'em all over the place, gotdammit... tasty chunks of beef brisket in the chili mixed w/ cheese on top of the fries.... the bbq chicken was ok, maybe a little on the dry side but there's a few diff sauces you can throw on that sucka to keep the party going... vinegar, bbq, mustard...they have it covered... mac n cheese is delish... the tangy coleslaw is tasty as well... (apparently we were the first folks to pronounce tangy right all day....the guy at the counter said folks were comin' in saying tan-jee) still have to try other things on the menu... the tri tip sammich is at the top of the list... the 5 stars are pretty much earned by the chili fries alone... thats it...I'm done...

I'm giving Memphis Minnie's a 3 stars in part because they were better than Hard Knox Cafe, which I also tried recently. Hard Knox was about a 2. That said, I still feel Minnie's serves food that could use a little improving. For example the pork ribs had a great flavor, but tasted overdone and dry. The brisket was the texture of sawdust, and had the exact same flavor as the pork. Both need the 3 varieties of sauces that Minnie's provides on each table. The restaurant staff was friendly and efficient and the environment was as satisfying and comforting as the homemade banana pudding. I had the baked beans (wonderful!) and potato salad (also dry, but flavorful), and would like to go back and try the mac and cheese and greens some other time. Now, must find others to try and compare...

THE BEST BBQ IN SF!! Sorry to yell there, but I just sorted the reviews here after seeing that MM didn't have a 4.5 or higher rating. I'm from Chicago and grew up visiting friends and family in Texas and Kentucky. Memphis Minnie's wouldn't be able to hold up in a BBQ contest in those areas, but neither would any Restaurant. BBQ is supposed to be something that you baby for a full day and put your love into. When you come to a BBQ joint you're getting BBQ joint food. Memphis Minnie's knows exactly what that should taste like. I come here at least once per month and I'll continue to do so. 60% of the time I come here I get the smoked andouille sausage. I use the BBQ sauce sparingly like it's supposed to be eaten. BTW - yelp should filter out reviews that rate a restaurant based on the fact that you live near it and hate the smell of BBQ. That's totally your fault dude. I would hate to live above or near any restaurant and that's why I don't...Don't hate the player; hate the game.

Blech, never again! ?Apparently the kind of place Yelpers faun over. ?Browse through the reviews and you can see that this place is a roll of the dice. ?Unfortunately, when my girlfriend and I went, we crapped out. $14 for FIVE pork ribs, two TINY sides and a small piece of cornbread/corn muffin... a good deal this place is not! ?Thank Satan there wasn't a wait, because I'd have been even more upset we paid this much for crappy bbq. Pork Ribs Mine were mushy and tasteless. ?My girlfriend's were so badly burned they were black and tough. Sides SMALL, as in they put them in tiny dipping cups. ?Mac and cheese was overcooked and tasteless. ?Potato salad was OK (mashed potatoes with a hint of sweetness). ?Greens tasted like vinegar and not much else. ?Sweet potatoes were overcooked but sweet and tasty. Corn bread/muffin Overcooked and crumbly. Sauce The red was thin and not at all savory (watch out, because it can just fly out of the top because it's basically the consistency of water). ?The mustard sauce tasted like it didn't belong on bbq. ?Didn't try the vinegar out of fear. If this is the best bbq SF has to offer, I'm going to cry.

Best damn brisket I have ever had. Same goes for the beef ribs. Oh man that brisket....Crusty on the outside, brittle moist flake on the inside. Total melt in your mouth goodness.At the end of the day it'll dry out a bit and that is when the Vinegar BBQ sauce comes in handy, though you'll want to use it sparingly ?cause the meat is FULL of flavor. My kids love the Turkey. I love the turkey because when my kids eat it, they fall asleep exactly 30 minutes later. And sake really, really goes well with BBQ. They havew some great ones here. Easily best BBQ in town if not in all of California.

Let's just get this out of the way, if you know anything about this part of the city, you might as well take the bus. I only say so because parking is scarce. But once you get in, you are automatically hungry (maybe the parking difficulty is intentional). I was able to try a bunch of things. Of note, I really enjoyed the Pork Egg Rolls as a starter. This may be worth the visit itself. The breaded grit sticks are good so long as you use that ranch side often. The real treat is the Brisket and the great sauce choices available at your table. Good lord, I almost walked out with the Texas Red Sauce and The Carolina Mustard Sauce (the hot sauce is also good). The sides were ordinary, so pick any. But out of nowhere, they have the BEST sweet tea ever. I'll be back...

Memphis Minnie's Bar-B-Que Joint & Smoke House bills itself as "The Home of Swine Dining." ?This could be because there's plenty of primo pork barbecued here daily (except Monday). ?Or perhaps it's a fusion of "swell" and "fine." ?The slogan is Truth In Advertising either way. If you dine in, you'll notice a banner requesting that you not take a seat until you've ordered at the register. ?Then you can help yourself to self-service beverages and sit and wait for your name to be called. ?Pick up your order back at the counter. ?Follow the same protocol for take-out ordering, except you'll have to wait standing up. I will echo what others have said about the individual plates being pricey. ?The food is excellent (see caveats below), but it's a better deal to order your meat (you don't want to be here if you're vegetarian) and sides by the pound if there are several of you. ?If it's just you, go for the combination plates which let you taste two or three things. ?Then you can tell your friends how much you liked it and bring them back with you to get the deal. From the barbecue, I like the St. Louis ribs (beef), the beef brisket, and ?the Memphis pork. ?The cole slaw is the kind made with vinegar. ?The beans and the mac & cheese are also very good. ?I haven't tried the greens. If you like burgers, don't miss the Minnie's Maxi Burger with bacon, cheese, and the seasoned fries. Memphis Minnie's barbecues the meat dry over wood coals. ?There is no sauce or rub on it when it is cooked or when it is served. ?A selection of sauces is on your table (or packed with your to-go order). ?Most of the sauces, while tasty, are more vinegary than the tomato-based sauce many are accustomed to. ?That type of sauce is conspicuously missing here. ?If that's what you like best, try the Red Sauce. ?It's the closest in flavor. Caveats: ?"Street Parking in the Lower Haight" could be the title of a horror novel by Stephen King. ?Take the Muni ?or take a cab, but don't take your car if you can possibly help it. ?You may think your friend who said "I'll find parking and catch up with you" has vanished into the fog. ?Seating is insufficient at peak times. ?You may find yourself with a plate of mouthwatering barbecue and nowhere to sit. ?Beware of the earlier closing time on Sunday. ?If you come close to closing, your order will be packed to go. ?Another peril of coming late is that you may wind up with the drier edges of the cuts of meat - this could give you a false impression of what Minnie's food is really like at its best. ?The iced tea is "sweet tea." ?Diabetics and weight watchers beware. Come well before closing and consider getting it by-the-pound to go. ?Then invite your friends over to your place and make them think you cooked it.

Eh... Ribs were all right. I'm a big BBQ fan, but I wasn't feeling this place. The sides were not impressive at all. Way too vinegary for my taste. Sauce was a tad bit watery... The rib meat was tough and scarce. I felt like a dog gnawing on his bone for a tiny morsel of tasteless meat. Honestly, I would come back to try the tri tip sandwiches and give it another chance. There has to be a reason why there was a 20 minute wait and a snake-like line that was out the door.

The meat is smokey yet tender and moist and you get your choice of sauce. ?The prices are solid, sides really good. ?Had the fried grit sticks and mac and cheese. ?

After a difficult day of drinking, my friends and I decided to eschew the usual Saturday night debauchery for some fatty food and trashy television. For the fatty food portion, we hit up Memphis Minnie's and bought the following items (for 3 people): * 1 pound of brisket * 1 pound of sweet pork * 1/2 pound of andouille sausage * 3 cornbread muffins * 1 pint of potlikker greens * 1 pint of mac & cheese * 1 large order of BBQ seasoned fries So, we may have gone out of control in the portions department since we could have fed the Duggar family with our order. ?But, everything - especially the greens and the mac & cheese - was delicious and just what we needed to get through the night.

Wow! So many southern bbq experts in SF ... who knew? Seriously, folks, get over yourselves (food snobs). Even the driest meat in the joint smacks of delicious, albeit sometimes subtle, smoky goodness. The sauce choices are excellent and the sides are sides and treated as such. Though I have to say the vinegar soaked greens are worth going back for (yup, some of us get that vinegar is a GOOD thing). Seriously, I've tried bbq from other Bay Area spots and none have been tastier than Memphis Minnie's. And for what it's worth, we thought the service was helpful as we attempted to navigate the fairly large menu. Will I go back? As soon as possible and I encourage others to give it a try.

To me, Memphis Minnie's is about one thing. ?Brisket. ?Good brisket. ?Smoked brisket. ?Slowly. ?Carefully. ?Charred around the edges. ?Tender meat, with a lovely smokey taste that can stand alone or together with various sauces that are served on the side. ?The sides are nothing to brag about, but when the meat is this good, who cares? The place is in the Lower Haight. ?Unassuming. ?A seemingly shabby place packed with carnivores intent on one thing, protein, fatty protein, meat. ?If you're a vegetarian and enter this place, someone may bite you. ? A fun, down home place with good old time eats. ?The way food used to be in the ice age, in a cave some where.

Went here for my first time recently during a lunch and booze session with work. The guy dishing me up my pulled pork sandwich looked like one of ?the "evil" hill people from that movie cabin fever. Obviously he didn't slice me up, and he was a cool guy. I don't know if it was the four beers I had before getting there or what. But that sandwich was pretty epic. The sauces really made it adventurous, and helped mix up the flavors with every bite. The sides were pretty generous too and helped fill in all the gaps. Two pitchers between the four of us probably didn't hurt either. I wanna go back someday when I'm not toasted, and then re-review. But it's gonna be hard when Rosemonde is right there, grabbing me by my balls, and dragging me in to eat a beer sausage.

I was so pumped to go here when I moved to Lower Haight. We made the mistake of believing some of these Yelp reviews (no offense, fellow Yelpers) and word of mouth. Supposedly, Memphis Minnie's is supposed to be good. And to be honest, it smells great when you walk by. But stop in, and the food doesn't come anywhere near the build up. We had dry brisket, greasy collard greens, watery mac n cheese, and the burger (which we read was great) was burned, over seasoned, and terrible. I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt, and hope that we went on an off night... but I can bring myself to go back inside. So disappointing. All I can say is, if I'm craving BBQ, I'll make it myself.

We came here on Saturday and got a Minnie's sampler. ?We had the brisket, beef ribs, pork ribs, greens, and mac and cheese. The brisket was so fatty and delicious. Super tender and moist (but declines as it cools, so eat it when it's hot!). The beef ribs were also really good. It's hard to find beef ribs that are seasoned and cooked properly. The St. Louis style pork ribs were mediocre and bland (especially when compared to the first two meats); I think it needed some seasoning and a good dose of salt. I would pass on these next time. The greens were super vinegary, and tasted like they were cooked with the Southern Carolina mustard sauce (sidenote: this sauce would make a great salad dressing), and I ate every last bit. The mac and cheese was creamy and serious comfort food, just like God intended. The space itself was awkward (it's definitely tight quarters!) and the kitchen, understandably, takes up the majority of the space. I'll definitely be back here. It doesn't hurt that Toro is right across the street.

Smoked meat proper style. The brisket is solid, but ladies and gentlemen they've done BBQ pork loin some real justice. Sweet pork sandwich, or the platter, or whatever, just grab some. So damn good, reminds me of the pork loin at Rudy's BBQ chain in Texas but twice the price. But u ain't going to fly to Texas to save $4 on BBQ so whatever. I don't know about Memphis Style, so no comment on that. It may just be that they have the mustard sauce. Don't matter; if you walk by on Haight your nose will lead you in the door and you'll try it yourself.

On Height between Filmore and Steiner, I remember there was another BBQ restaurant that went out of business not long ago. They were one of the branches of excellent Korean style grill "Hibachi" (Note: Hibachi is a Japanese word, but the business is run by Koreans. They serve awesome food that isn't available in elsewhere.) When I noticed that "Hibach" was gone, I said to myself "Competition level of eateries in this area must be too high". So when I walked in Memphis Minnie's, my expectation for their BBQ was more than descent. I had a reason to believe there must have been a note-worthy quality and special preparation behind each item they served. Otherwise, how could they knock "Hibachi" out of the block for good? Well, I was in it for a rude awakening. For the first time, I dumped my BBQ into a trash bag without going for a second bite. As repeatedly mentioned here by many viewers, ribs was dry, tasteless, cold, and the smell of disgusting fat, instead of savory smell of properly smoked meat, reminded me of a bad cooking procedures. I will not go back to Memphis Minnie's again until they invite a real pit master from a Southern State to reintroduce to them the way to cook BBQ. Food was very bad and unacceptable, so I did not look into other criteria. I still do not understand what made good place go bankrupt and sub-standard neighbor live on. Perhaps, the hypocritical tendency of Height hippies has been going against natural selectivity throughout generations.

I have always been a fan of Memphis Minnie's. ?The food is always good, my husband usually orders a pound of brisket & rib tips (to go). ?The sides are so-so, but I don't really care for sides with my BBQ. ?

Recommended Dish: None. Despite the fact that the restaurant was packed and extremely busy, I didn't see what everyone was raving about. We ordered at least 4 different meats along with at least 3 different sides. None of their dishes seemed tasty or good in general. If anything, the meat was tough and hard to chew, the sauce was overpowering and at time even overwhelming, and the sides were at best mediocre. For the price (considering the quality of food) combined with the lack of seating (able to seat 30 people best case, if everyone squeezed cheek to cheek), I would give this BBQ joint 1 star. But the sweet and friendly staff behind the counter, at least that's how I remember them in my mind, made me roll the rating up to 2 stars.

Average BBQ in SF with the best part being the Texas beef brisket (smoked 18 hours). ?That brisket (the only thing I would recommend getting) just melted in my mouth and was the best I can remember tasting on the west coast. ?I've been to some better BBQ's in Oklahoma and Texas but I'm not in Texas so I got to remember the environment I'm in. ?The St. Louis style smoked pork ribs and Memphis sweet smoked pork were just average and nothing special. ? It was kind of a cool ambiance with flying pigs all over the place but that doesn't make the BBQ taste any better. ?I also had the fried peach pie (not worth getting) because it sounded interesting but the problem was that it was fried but it didn't really taste like peach and looked more like a hot pocket. ?They should call it a "fried peach imitation hot pocket." ?I've tasted some really good fried pies in Oklahoma so I got to remember, "I'm in California, not Oklahoma."

As other reviewers have pointed out, BBQ is quite a subjective thing. Sauce? Smoked? Rub? Pork? Beef? Hot? Sweet? Tangy? ?Therefore, I base my review on the things all BBQ must do. ?But you can have it any way you want here b/c they St. Louis and Memphis AND THEIR SAUCES ARE AMAZING, if you are into that. Best: The sauces - we got 4 and my boyfriend loved 2 while I LOVED the other 2. Happy family w/ no fighting.: ranch base, mustard based, spicy cajun creamy, BBQ sauce. Best: BBQ pork rolls- minced bbq pork rolled like an eggroll and fried. The Sides: good tangy relish-based slaw (not drenched in mayo), solid cornbread muffins (could use a little more flavor), beans are solid too. The meat: all the meat were perfectly cooked and the you could pull the meat off the ribs WITH YOUR FORK! ?Tender tender tender! ?You don't even need a knife for the steak either. For me, I thought everything was good but MAYBE the meat was too "smokey" (I know I know) but my boyfriend who is from the south and has had MANY BBQs loved it all. We both agree - BBQ pork rolls are the BOMB!

Memphis Minnie's is a fun place to go. I like the decor a lot. The quality of the food is very good, but I'm just NOT in love with the BBQ sauces here. And that really puts a damper on my BBQ experience if I'm not IN LOVE with the sauce, man. I keep meaning to eat brunch here, 'cause I hear it's yummy delicious. The shop owner is a really nice fellow, but generally the other staff is humorless and kinda unpleasant. I will probably keep coming back because it's still a good place. They have great sides and very high quality meats, but sheesh, the sauce doesn't thrill my buds. I keep meaning to get some Memphis Minnie's to go and use Big Nate's BBQ sauce on it instead. That might just put me over the BBQ edge.

Not your traditional BBQ spot - but don't get me wrong, this place is still good. ?I have to agree with other yelpers, the sides are odd (collared greens)- but if you like weird flavors like I do - give it a try!

Yesterday, on a hot & beautiful day in San Francisco my gf and I were in the mood for some great BBQ. We checked out yelp and a lot of my fellow yelpers recommended Memphis Minnie's. THANK YOU!! We went down there and had some wonderful BBQ that whisked us off to the south. We ordered the beef ribs, which were ab fab. Very smokey flavor, not covered in sauce like some other places do and very authentic. I also ordered the southern star sandwich, which is half beef brisket and half smoked pork. Incredible flavors and cooked to perfection. The prices are pretty good and you get a lot of food for your buck at this spot in the lower height. I'm a huge fan and my gf and I are having dinner there this Wednesday and I am very excited!! Great BBQ in sf is hard to find, so trust me when I say this spot is a must go. Update to 1st review: I went this past Saturday, ordered over the phone to avoid long line & when I arrived I was told to wait at the end of the line, which defeats the purpose of ordering over the phone. I digress. It looks like Memphis Minnie's has a problem with consistency b/c in my 1st review I mentioned how wonderful they are. The 2nd experience was absolutely garbage! I ordered Texas Beef ribs and they were terrible!!!!! One large chuck of fat all the way through & very small amount of edible meat, which was a truly disgusting experience! Three ribs came with the order & I ended up tossing the last one b/c there was way too much fat & gristle for my taste. So, as much as I want to love this place I don't!!!!

The colorful signage, cute pig stuff and location in a cool neighborhood drew me into Memphis Minnie's tonight... I was with a friend who often orders the chicken sandwich and really liked it so, we decided to give their other menu items a try too. ? We ordered the brisket sandwich which was dry (good bread though) and the Saint Louis style ribs, which were tasty and tender but, also a lil dry on the ends. ?They are served without sauce, which I prefer, and your chosen sides come in lil bowls on the side. ?We had the beans, which were not cooked enough and a bit hard/chewy, the potato salad, which I actually really liked, and the sweet potatoes, which were tasty though so sweet, they should have been on the dessert menu. ? Now for the sauces... of the 4 offered, a vinegar, mustard, bbq and hot sauce, I only liked the mustard sauce enough to eat with my food. ?Sad, I know. ?Apparently the sauce that's on the chicken sandwich is different and better... I wish they'd have had it out on the table. ? All-in-all, I wouldn't seek-out Memphis Mini's but I'd go back to try other things if friends wanted to meet there. ?My friend still supports his chicken sandwich and the ribs, potato salad and sweet potatoes were good enough to reorder probably. ? On my own however, I'd rather check out a new unknown joint... it's part of my quest for the best BBQ on the west coast. ?:) Might see ya there.

Stopped by Memphis Minnie's today to satisfy my hankering for BBQ. Ordered the two way combo that comes with two meats (smoked chicken and brisket), 2 sides (beans and seasoned fries) and a corn muffin (they left it off my order! Boo! It happens.) for takeout. The food was prepared rather quickly, with the food and the restaurant smelling wonderfully of smoked meat. Once I opened the takeout box, the food was still pretty warm, but some of the fries were soggy from the steam built up in the container and the liquid from the beans. That's okay though, they were still tasty. The chicken is really good. Not only were the thigh and drumstick well cooked, the fat had all but melted off, leaving just a well seasoned, crispy skin. Yum! The brisket was a bit on the salty side, but otherwise very juicy and tender. The order came with a container of the mustard sauce and a container of the Texas BBQ sauce. Both were quite good and would be good on salads, veggies and even a plain broiled chicken breast. The utensils were thrown in the container...is that their thing? I've never really seen that before and am not sure I like having it covered in food before I even have a chance to eat it (the food, that is). Having spent a couple of years in the South and eaten my share of BBQ, I thought the food was okay, but on the pricey side. On my next visit I definitely want to dine in to sample the food hot and fresh out of the pit. Plus, I want my corn muffin! Staff was friendly and efficient. Love the decor with the pig theme. ?Parking was a bit painful, but not impossible.

The atmosphere here is pretty nice. It's not your typical restaurant and you order at the counter then sit and wait for them to call your name. I got the Beef Brisket meal is it didn't look like a lot of food, but I was quite stuffed! Mac & Cheese was good, but i like mine with more cheese. If I happen to be in the area again, I may drop by for another taste. Oh, and make sure to try to supid hot sauce!

Wow. How did I not know this existed? Probably because I don't explore the entire city, but anyways this place is better than Blues BBQ except for the cornbread (Blues cornbread is so moist and just melts in your mouth...and you can totally taste the corn). My bf and I shared the 3 meat plate (which came with two sides and a cornbread) and it was definitely more than enough for the two of us for less than $20. They also serve beer, wine and saki. ?The pulled pork was delicious, and so was the beef brisket, although it was ?a little fatty. ?The pork ribs were good but they didn't have much meat on them. Mac and cheese was good (not the best I've ever had) and the french fries were good (slightly spicy and sweet seasoning). The sweet potato side was okay (I asked how they were made, and the owner told me exactly how they make them, apple juice and all ha- i was just wondering if they were mashed - they're cubed btw). But the owner gets extra points because he said if we didn't like the sweet potatoes that much, we could change our side. While they were cooking it, we decided to switch bc we saw another person's fries, and he gave us an extra side for free. The owner seems pretty awesome and the place just has an awesome vibe. We'll definitely be back. O- not 5 stars because although the meat was awesome for the most part, the sides were not awesome (they will still really good). And because they only had 4 sauces (I know that sounds like a lot), but there wasn't one that was spectacular...maybe I'm being too judgmental...it was great. yummm

Memphis Minnie's was my very first dining experience in San Francisco and I had huge expectations. ?A smattering of tables and big kitschy signs everywhere. ?It was too crowded to dine in, so my friends and I took out (the crowded usually would indicate greatness). I got the special burger on recommendation from the girl at the counter. ?The burger took forever, but was definitely worth it. ?Bacon, cheese, onion strings and some quality beef. ?The fries were lackluster though. ?Seasoned, but soft and limp. ?The BBQ sauces were also just so so. ?The red one I got was thin and missing either sweetness or a kick. ?The spicy honey mustard was a bit better, but still tasted too thin. ?Mixing the two did nothing. If I came back I would go for a different side and try to dine in and taste a few more of their sauces.

I was hankering some Southern comfort food, and was recommended this Haight Street eatery as a place to get it. ?I went to school in the South and drove to every state south of the Mason-Dixon line (and ate something in every single one), so I am a bit particular about my ribs. ?Ribs, like most meats, come in three varieties. ?Bad, Very Good, and Freakin' Incredible. ?There is really no 'mediocre' ribs. Memphis Minnie's had the right interior decor for a good rib place, namely a bunch of artifacts from other ribs places, but the lack of a proper open flame over or cooker was the first sign that this was not proper BBQ. ?I ordered the smoked pork ribs and waited for my meal to come out. When it came out, I was a little disappointed from the get go. ?The ribs were dry and sauceless, which is fine for slow cooked and spice rubbed Southern (Carolina) style ribs, but the meat fell off the bone like saucy and more quickly cooked Northern (Carolina) style ribs. ?The three sauces on offer, a tiny red BBQ sauce of sorts, an uninspiring mustard sauce, and a simple vinegar sauce did their best to add some zing to the affair, but over all I was left unimpressed. If anything, great ribs should leave you looking like a mess, no matter how careful you are. ?Northern style ribs soak you in sauce, Southern style ribs coat you with the spice rub. ?These ribs just left a hint of grease on my fingers. So while the meat was not great, the sides were alright. ?The mac and cheese was good enough, as was the potato salad. ?The sweet potatoes really didn't do much for me though because there really wasn't much that went into their preparation, served neither candied nor with brown sugar. Over all, two stars. ?One for trying, the other for the decor. ?None for the food.

I must have come on a good day, because after reading all of the mediocre reviews, I came with zero expectations. ?We were the first people in the restaurant, so our food was fresh outta the smoker. ?I only get brisket at BBQ places and this brisket did not disappoint. ?This is legit BBQ, unlike Bo's where they put the "east bay twist" on it. ?The brisket had a delicious pink smoke ring and a pretty thick layer of fat that kept the meat moist. ?You have a choice of the three sauces on the side (S. Carolina mustard, N. Carolina vinegar and Texas red) and they're at the table, so you can put as little or as much on as you'd like. ? I also got the two sides of beans and mac n' cheese. ?The beans were to DIE for. ?Baked with pieces of brisket (and I'm sure cooked in fat or drippings), these beans were super tasty. ?The mac n' cheese wasn't mindblowing, but the thick Velveeta-style sauces was pretty good. ?Add a cornbread muffin, and the whole plate was delicious! ?The bf had a side of coleslaw and couldn't eat more than a couple bites since it tasted like cucumber vinegar salad. ?Gross. ?Skip that one for sure. ? The one downfall that took this down to 4 stars was the guy behind the counter. ?He had a chip on his shoulder and acted like we had just stepped into BBQ heaven. ?Everything seemed like a chore to him and he had an attitude that you don't expect to find at any restaurant, let alone a laid-back BBQ joint. ? The place itself was pretty kitschy with pigs and t-shirts and awards all over. ?The only thing this place needs is a cool outdoor area, but I guess you can't have it all. ? Bottom line: If you can catch this place on a good day, you're golden.

So, the mac and cheese is better at the Hard Knox, as is the cornbread... but when you're having soul food, it's all about the side dishes. At a good BBQ ?joint, it's all about the meat. Meat is what they do well here. I personally go for a Southern Star: half a brisket sandwich and half a pulled pork sandwich. With potato salad or slaw, it's a fantastic lunch made better only by a post meal beer across the street at the Toronado. Here's the tip... Wednesday is pastrami day (which they reckon might be the best east of 2nd Ave in New York). While it certainly isn't New York deli pastrami, it's amazingly good and addictive. Beer, BBQ and sake (I know, I still can't figure it out) and pretty decent sides give Minnie's a clear 4 stars.

I have been wanting to go here for quite some time and finally made it in on Sunday for lunch. I have dined at many a good barbecue spots across the country, including the infamous Arthur Bryant's in KC. I was pleasantly surprised by the pork ribs. They were deliciously smoked and the choices of sauce are delicious. This also happens to be the only restaurant I have ever seen to serve pudding with vanilla wafers (ingenious and delicious). I like that it has the hole in the wall vibe and though some find the wall decor tacky, I like knowing I am eating somewhere with a bit of history. Extra stars for the picnic style seating and the unlimited roll of paper towels at each table.

My friends and I were underwhelmed with the food after seeing the collage of awards and even the Yelp sticker on the windows. My roommate is from Texas so we were hoping to find some real BBQ finally, but alas the search continues. In all the BBQ meats tasted all right, but it just wasn't as good as the hype was. The three of us each got the two-way combo for $14.95 or $16.22 after tax (choice of two meats, two sides, and a corn bread muffin.) They had three sauces: a red bbq, a mustard sauce, and a vinegar base. Roll of paper towels supplied for your convenience - nice! + Meat We ended getting a combination of beef ribs, sweet-smoked pulled pork, beef brisket, andouille sausage, and smoked chicken. I tasted everything except the beef ribs. Sweet smoked pulled pork: kinda bland and not as moist as I'd thought it would be. It tasted only a bit sweet, and not really smokey. Beef beef brisket: moist and great beef flavor, but not really a smoke/bbq flavor. Nice thin layer of fat on top for juice. I needed to add sauce to it to make it to my liking. Andouille sausage: good sausage! It had a bit of spice to it so it had good flavor and texture. Smoked chicken: smokiness is there, but I found the meat quite dry. + Sides Fries: Wow these were tasty! They gave us a mountain of them and they were really well-seasoned. Crispy and not swimming in oil either. Macaroni & Cheese: swimming in cheese sauce, and super rich, not exactly appetizing, but more of a guilty pleasure. Baked Beans: pretty standard, tasted how they are supposed to Potato Salad: Good mix of eggs and mayo and other veges to go with the red potatoes. Consistency was there, but it tasted like regular potato salad. Collared Greens: I'm not sure if they were supposed to be this way, but the greens tasted pickled, and were too tangy with vinegar to consume. We didn't eat much of it. Coleslaw: too tangy and too sweet. This isn't coleslaw made with mayo. It's made with vinegar so it was wet, sweet, and sour. Didn't finish this either. + Conclusion They didn't really screw up on anything, but it wasn't really awesome either. The sauces there are too sweet or too tangy for my liking. I'd come back if I was really hungry and in the area, but in terms of BBQ the search continues. *looks into the horizon*

First time I came here I thought the food was already around solid bbq. ?Great for San Francisco, but nothing to really write home about being from the midwest. ?Well the longer I am away from the Midwest, the more I appreciate the bbq here. ?If you want sweet, tangy, sticky BBQ Memphis Minnie's is your spot. I will tell you this... the wings are off the hook yums! Nice sticky bbq lickin' wings and great greens certainly make Memphis Minnies a regular stop on my heart attack bbq circuit. ?The bbq isn't the wipe off on your napkin, lick your finders bbq. ?You need a moist toilette and a faucet with soap to get the stickiness off of your digits. I wouldn't make the Texas Beef Brisket chili a regular of my ordering, but you gotta give this goodness a try.

These are all the things I remember about Minnie's after having been here twice: - the brisket is FANTASTIC. I didn't even know what brisket was before I ordered it, but omfg! Melt in your mouth, flavorful, yum! - side dishes were so-so to me. - do NOT sit down at a table until you have ordered. There's a sign that says so and I watched a bunch of people get yelled at by the staff. - the sauces on the table are good, but I'd probably buy brisket by the pound to go next time.

I was there -- got the st louis pork rib platter. ?It was OK. ?I mean the portions were big enough, the meat was tender, but man I have had WAY better BBQ than this in my life. ?The corn bread muffin was dry and fairly bland. ?The beans weren't tangy at all. ?I mean BAKED BEANS are supposed to be tangy. ? I'd probably rate it higher, but forking over $17 for casual dining fare and a drink is really a bleeding screw. ?But you know, they have a veritable monopoly on this kind of thing in SF. ?Now I want to go back to Milwaukee and go to Pitch's for some real rib action.

I don't get it...everyone says this is "The Best" bbq in town. I've tried it on numerous occasions since it took over Spaghetti Western. (a place dear in my heart still) I just find the meat way too dry, is that what 'good smoked meat' is supposed to be? Then you drown it in a mediocre sauce? No, sorry, I like meat that hasn't been dried to the near point of jerky. The veggies are way overcooked, fries are spiced but also sugared, too weird for my taste. Everything is too sweet, the sauces, the fries, the sweet tea. I keep meaning to try the wings and grits, but have not yet been pleased by anything else on the menu. I like the guys behind the counter though, they are always sweet but snarky, my favorite combo.

still searching for *really* good BBQ here in the city. MM's is the best I've found to date (and a damn bit better than big nate's). I had the tri-tip platter, with baked beans and potato salad for sides and a cornbread muffin. ?the meat was done perfectly -- a nice medium rare with a good crust on the outside, thinly sliced and well-portioned. ?good stuff. the baked beans were *really* good. ?home run there. ?as was the potato salad. the cornbread muffin was, um, like a chunk of partially moistened corn meal. ?it looked good, but ate like a sawdust brick. ?crunch. ?crunch. ?I hate cornbread muffins that taste like a fluffy, sickly-sweet cornbread cake... but would have preferred even that over being served a gritty door-stop. also didn't get the "BBQ" sauces they make available at the tables. ?they have a "south carolina" mustard sauce (which tastes like it would be good on a salad, but eeep -- keep it away from the meat!)... a "north carolina" vinegar sauce (good for fries, perhaps?) and a candy-assed, "texas red sauce." perhaps it's my own regional tastes in BBQ prejudicing me here... but none of these sauces taste good on meat. ?isn't that a BBQ sauce pre-requisite? ?if your idea of a BBQ sauce is limited to one dimension: sweet... you'll do fine. ?I'd like a little smoke and the option of a little heat to mine, thanks. not saying you shouldn't give 'em a try though. ?I'm sure I'll go back to try out some of their other offerings... while continuing my search for a 4 or 5 star BBQ joint here.

This place is overhyped. Ordered a Minnie's Taster place w/ pork ribs, brisket, spicy sausage w/ sides of seasoned fries and sweet potatoes. Also ordered a cup of chili. Meat overload! The meat flavoring was mediocre, the 3 sauces on the table were pretty gross. The chili was sooo heavy, one or two spoonfuls and I was done. Far better meat and sides at Uncle Franks in Mountain View. The bbq at my work is sooooo much more flavorful and delicious. oh well!

I like Memphis Minnie's okay, but I wish I liked them more. ?I also wish it wasn't all the way in the haight where there's no parking and no close BART stop. Anyway, as far as BBQ goes, this is the best I've found so far in SF. ?That's not saying that much (I haven't really found an amazing BBQ place in SF yet) but I have been here a few times and enjoyed the food each time. ?The pulled pork is quite tasty, but the ribs are kind of dry and could be a little bit more tender. ?As far as sides, I thought the mac and cheese was average, and the sweet potatoes and fries were both good. ?Next time, I plan to try their burger. The prices are slightly higher than I'd like and it can be tough to get seating inside if its crowded, so keep that in mind. Overall, I give this place a mild recommendation.

1 star for friendly service. 1 star for cool location in the Haight, complete with cute piggies. 1 star for tasty side dishes. -1 star for watery bbq sauce -1 star for price. I'm sorry, but this place does not cut it for me. My boyfriend and I are on the hunt for the best BBQ in the city, and Memphis Minnie's has been on our list for quite sometime, but after we saw them on Check Please Bay Area, we knew we had to go ASAP. I'm not a fan of their BBQ sauce at ALL. It's super watery!!! ?And, after all, this is a BBQ joint so that is kind of important. Not to mention, it was $42 for 2 entrees and 2 sodas (ok, one dish was a meat sampler, but come on man!). I could spend that much at a semi-upscale eatery in SF, with table service to boot. I have so many BBQ places on my yelp bookmark list that I will not be back. On to the next.

Review of St Louis Ribs 'n sauce; handcut fries: ?Went this afternoon based on yelper comments thought it would be nice to do up some Sunday bbq in the lower haight. ?If you go, also read Rick H's review about the drop in quality of rib meat because I hope the pork ribs were once better than this-- they are big-boned, but the meat is too dry and lacks full smoke. ?Howevah, the superior taste of the sweet Texas Red Sauce (Rick refers to) remains apparent. ?Their sweet texas red sauce has punch, depth, smoothiness and a very subtle heat-- the components of great bbq sauce. ?Not to be mistaken for the orangey (Kansas?) sauce (they supply orange & sweet red sauces for your ribs) that needs to cut back about 1/3 of vinegar-- way too astringent. ? Another miss: though my heart palpitates at the site of the phrase "handcut fries," ?MM's bbq fries were a downer. ?First, I wish I knew they were SHOESTRING fries 'cause unless it's sweet potato shoestrings, McDonald's or "pomme frites"-- I don't believe in shoestring fries. ?Since they were none of the above, it got even sadder when I opened the container to discover a MOUND O' FRIES over-coated in an addictive bbq spice which IS addictive but cannot mask the soggy, starchy, shoestring potato compromise. (I did not have it, but the people beside me looked like they were really enjoying the beef brisket and possibly the tri-tip; those cuts looked ok-- from about 5 feet away!). ? I will go back for brunch because the space is really cute, clean and the staff appears super-friendly, and how can one resist the concept of BARBECUE BRUNCH?? HOWEVER, for authenticity's sake-- IF you want falling off the bone meat succulent specialty sauce ribs, homemade sides and full-on street-cred you go to Brother-n-laws in the Western Additon NOT Memphis-minnie-mouse in the faux lo-haight! ?The IDIOT reviewer who said the MM is better than Brother-n-Laws is obviously typing with one hand and holding a crack pipe with the other!

I want to give this place 3 stars for having some so-so menu items and inconsistencies in quality, but I can't because I love their burgers too much. Ask for yours medium, with grilled onions and pimento cheese. I promise you'll like it. Promise. The second reason, I can't give it three stars is the shrimp and grits that they serve for brunch. Creamy grits, served with a nice portion of grilled shrimp, tomatoes, cheese, and green onions. So terribly rich and awesome that most of the time I pretend it doesn't exist, just so I can fit in my jeans.

This place is soooo good. Its got my vote for the best BBQ in the bay area. All their meat is good. My favorite is the pulled pork (oh sweet & tender pulled pork... how I loveth thow) but the tri tip & brisket is top knotch. I'm sure the other meats are good too but the pork, tri tip, and brisket are all so good I've never even tried anything else. Get a plate, get a sandwich, get a Memphis Minnie's sampler & share it! Whatever you do, you'll walk away happy. Everyone who works there acts like a douche, but its part of the atmosphere and gives the place some motzie. Once you get used to the ordering setup & service and actually get to know the workers a bit, you see its really just a show. You're still reading this? GO GO GO GO GO GO!!!!

YUM!!! Super causal restaurant with a great atmosphere. There are piggies decorations everywhere and the walls are covered with t-shirts and more decorations. You order with the cashier and pick your own table. The table comes with 3 big bottles of sauces: Texas red sauce, north Carolina vinegar sauce and south Carolina mustard sauce, all very tasty. When your name is called, you can pick up your food from the friendly chefs. Our friendly cashier gave us great recommendations and informed us that they have some super big plates if we were hungry. I ordered the southern star - half Texas brisket and half memphis sweet pork sandwich, potlikker greens, corn bread muffin and a sweet tea. It was soooooooo tasty. The brisket just melted in your mouth and the different sauces made the meat super juicy. I also saw bbq seasoned fries and fried cheese grit sticks on the menu and can't wait to come back and try it. They also sell meats by the pound and have a variety of sake - apparently, it's delicious with bbq and I won't disagree. There's also fried peach pie, banana puddn and sweet potato pie on the dessert menu. Plenty of reasons to come back again. :-)

It shocks me that 200+ people give this place an average of 4 stars. I would give this 3, but I'm trying to skew the average so its a little more realistic. This is not a 4-star BBQ restaurant. Although the meat is tender and falls off the bone, you have to add a lot of their sauce in order to get taste out of it. And I'd avoid the chicken altogether since it doesn't have much flavor. As for sides, don't get the cole slaw. Yuck. The mac n' cheese is good, as are the beans. Nothing special though. And I vote for the Sweet Potato pie for dessert. There's always a happy ending with that. Overall, it's a decent place and you get a lot for your money. But it could be better. In fact, I pick Nate's BBQ over this any day.

Update: After a recent visit I've decided to upgrade the rating to 3 stars. Probably spurred on as much by my lack of good BBQ as anything else. The meat was good, it was smoked properly and had a very generous smoke ring, but it still failed to deliver the succulent tenderness that I'm used to. Still, my ratings criteria is a bit stricter than most. If this place was in Kansas City I'd never have given a second thought to coming back. Their sauces are still their weakest link and part of this seems almost intentional given how the owner is diametrically opposed to my own fierce loyalties as a strong proponent of dry BBQ. Even if you take it to go and put your own sauce on it at home it's just not quite up to the standards or really good BBQ. Mediocre, but perhaps given the environment it might top out at average. So add a star if you're West coast born and raised, but if you're from a place that knows how to do BBQ right and have strong opinions about the proper way to do it then, well, this probably isn't for you. Personally the biggest problem for me is that I'm from Kansas City and they just didn't offer an appropriate sauce. All three sauces available are strong vinegar sauces and reflect more of a focus on Carolina style (both mustard and a light tomato sauce are available) bbq than Memphis style. The "Texas style" sauce seemed a bit off , but then I've never been as familiar with Texas sauces. What was totally lacking, though, was a thick, rich molasses-laden sauce of the type that really speaks to me as barbecue and without this, well... it just wasn't right. The meat itself didn't really live up to much of anything with the ribs failing to be fall-apart tender and without a lot of flavor on their own. If you're in the Lower Haight and really need some bbq then maybe stop in and give them a try, but if not... well, it's not worth crossing the city for and it's probably not worth a second trip.

Not a bad place to eat BBQ, although the meats were all more dry and crispy than I had hoped. ?The side dishes of mac and cheese (which tasted like fake cheese and not in a good way) and the french fries. ?THe corn bread was a bit dry, so have your water ready before attempting to eat it. The only highlight worth mentioning was the chili cheese fries, which were drenched in tasty chili and good fries. ?Unfortunately one dish isn't enough for me to raise the rating above 3. ?I may go back to try other items but I'll be in no hurry to do so.

I can't believe some people consider this "good barbecue"... the ribs were so chewy I had a jaw ache after eating here. This is not the end-all to beat-all of California BBQ that some Helper's are making it out to be.The brisket sandwich was okay, but other then that i found the food to be less then desirable. If given a choice between Minnie's ribs or a burnt car tire smothered with with BBQ Sauce, i think i might chose the tire instead! at least I'll know it;s something i can chew through and digest!!!!

I went there once, and I was unimpressed. I read all the reviews again, and realized that I had to give it another shot. Today, I gave it another shot. Not only did they run out of ribs at 11:30am (I know, WTF?), but the sides were overly sweet, the BBQ sauces were strange, and the meat was only so-so. The rib tips - dry but edible. Not too much smokey flavor, but at least the cartilage was tender. Beef Brisket - I tell ya, i never seen meat that looked so funny, but it was juicy and nice. A little smokey flavor, and just the right amount of fat - I'd say this was the best thing we got. Chicken - dry and uninspired. 'nuff said Pork - pretty tasty, slightly on the dry side, but above average Tri-tip - no thoughts whatsoever coleslaw - omg wtf was this shit. it's like sugar water + vinegar + cabbage and red peppers. no good. Mac n Cheese - bland at best Greens - DO NOT GET THESE. Sweet mother of God. It's like someone drowned some green napkins in a jar of high fructose corn syrup. I never tasted something so offensive. Fries - they're pretty good for fries, and the dry rub is tasty. Cornbread muffin - slightly above average. Mustard sauce - the most interesting of the 3 sauces, a little too buttery for my taste Texas sauce - omg who turned on the cinnamon-sugar faucet? somebody's gotta control that. that's almost all you can taste! Vinegar sauce - like...it's black vinegar. with some pepper in it. is that bbq sauce? I'll go back again for the ribs and adjust my review accordingly, but for now, only 3 stars.

I found out about this place from the stellar reviews on Check Please Bay Area and apparently, so has everyone else. The place was packed. I could sense the regulars fuming that their little cozy Lower Haight BBQ joint had been invaded by foodies. The system of ordering was a bit confusing and this tension was in the air. My questions of "So, how does this work, exactly?" were met with hostility and anxiety from other customers. People, relax -- it's BBQ! My girlfriend and I split the three-meat platter, we got Texas Beef Ribs, Brisket and Smoked Chicken. All three were incredible, but I can't believe I didn't order any pork! What the hell is wrong with me?? The meat was flavorful and the BBQ sauce at our table was great, but I honestly didn't even need to coat everything with it. The chicken was incredibly tender. My only complaint was the brisket was a tad dry for my taste. The demand on a Friday night was so intense that they literally SOLD OUT OF FOOD by 8pm, which seems to happen a lot lately according to these reviews. Good food, reasonable prices, friendly staff, fun n' kitschy ambiance. I would definitely go back to try more of the eclectic menu.

My brother 'makes' me go here whenever I'm in town. ?It is the one place where I always make an exception for my vegetarianism for. ?I can't really single anything out, as everything I've ever had here is fanflabbytastic.

If I were able to rate each menu entry separately, it'd be 5, nay 6 stars for the brisket alone. Memphis Minnie's walks away from all the local barbecue competitors just on the basis of the quality of the meat. The best sauce in the world can't compensate for gristly meat chunks. The sides are all tasty--greens, yams, cole slaw. I wish the portions were a little bigger, because it's good and I want more of it. My biggest gripe is the sauces. Memphis Minnie's offers a choice of 3 sauces on the tables. A mustardy sauce, a vinegary sauce, and a more typical bbq sauce. I'm generally skeptical of self-lubricating barbecue situations, but I wish Memphis Minnie's tried harder in the sauce department. The sauces are not only self-serve (which means the meat is not sauced on arrival) but also they're merely adequate. I'd be happier buying a bucket o' brisket and bringing it home to use my own home-made barbecue sauce.

I've been coming here as much as I can for the last five years for lunch. ?Last night for dinner, my husband and I ordered: - The pulled pork was moist and tender. Hint of smoke, but not overwhelming. You can actually taste the meat. Love the pig and the pig will love you. Delicious! - The rib-tips were a little dry, but after trying the ribs at Everett & Jones, these were definitely not ?bad. - Tri-tip had slivers of fats meshed in with chunks of good ol' flesh. It was cooked just right. - The lickin' greens played a tug-of-war of ?sweet and sour vinegar taste in my mouth that was different to greens I've had at other bbq places. I would have loved it more if I had not doused my meats with the wonderful vinegar sauces on the table. ? - Mac and Cheese. I'm a sucker for anything that mixes cheese and pasta. This one was ok, but not the best I've had because it wasn't creamy and could have been warmed up a little so it wasn't congealed. - Cornbread I didn't try because I was so stuffed. In the past I have enjoyed it. Staff has always been friendly. The cashier did a great job controlling the tables during peak dinner time (don't occupy table until you place your order). ?The place was small and it packed last night. The menu has grown since my last visit over a year ago. Not too sure I like the egg rolls and sake on the menu, but oh well. ?As long as the ?the meats are the main attraction and cooked well, then I'll still come back.

Sunday morning, a little hungover, watching the noon run of Check Please when we see Memphis Minnie's being featured. Barbecue? 18-hour Brisket? F*ck yeah! Initial impression is that the place is not even close to authentic. It seems like it's trying too hard, down to the pig figurines and "vintage" signs that looks like they were made yesterday. The whole place feels branded, and I was disappointed that I wasn't overwhelmed with thick barbecue smells or even a hint of smoke. I got the brisket plate, and my buddy Jake R. ordered everything. Damn, the brisket is good. But the sides were a major disappointment: the slaw is vinegar based w/o mayonnaise. The macaroni and cheese was utterly forgettable and the cornbread was inexcusable in its crumbly dryness and lack of corn flavor. They were also very small portions. I ate a rib from my friend's plate, and that was pretty good. In the end I was stoked about the brisket and a few redeeming qualities about the place, but not ultimately satisfied on my search for the best barbecue in San Francisco.

I went with 3 other girls...and we shared three plates.. The Ribs, Rib tips, and Tri Tip Sides-potato salad, coleslaw, fries, mac and cheese, corn bread. Ribs and Tri Tip was ok....didn't really impress me Rib Tips-They were the best and it was more filling and cheaper. Potato Salad was really good...big chunks of potato Coleslaw was not very good. Fries had good seasoning I did not try the Mac and Cheese because im Lactose Intolerant Corn Bread was dry and really grainy (i prefer hard knox corn bread) at the end bill was ~$50 for 3 plates...not bad...next time im just gonna stick with the Rib Tips....

I've now eaten here twice and I'd say both experiences were a plus. However, I will say that the food on my first visit was a bit better than the second. ?Their beef brisket is quite nice but it has a little too much fat on the edges for my taste. Some will argue that the fat is what gives it taste, however I disagree. I'm just a picky eater that way. The staff is great ... playful, friendly, and when it is not packed, they have a wicked sense of humor. ?The pulled pork was great both times I've visited. I would definitely go back.

Memphis Minnie's is a meat lovers paradise. I didn't know it was even possible to bbq meat for 18 hours, until I discovered Memphis Minnies' brisquit. Make sure to get that, along with the andouille sausage and a side of mac and cheese. They also serve sake here. Who would have thought???

I've tried a few of the different menu items and the St Louis style ribs are by far my favorite. They are quite tasty and have a slight apple wood smoke flavor to them and the meat was succulent and tender, practically falling off the bone. I doused them in the Bezzelbub sauce which is not for the faint of heart as it's a habanero based hot sauce made on the premises (as all their sauces are I belive). That sauces kicks and has a great flavor that cuts through the heat. It has a great laid back atmosphere and the staff is always been super friendly! Now it's not as great as the BBQ I've had in Memphis, Texas or even KC but c'mon folks this is San Fran not exactly a BBQ mecca. It's also the first BBQ joint I've ever seen that has a sake tasting menu??? Like I said it's not the best I've ever had but if I'm anywhere near Memphis Minnies you can sure bet I'm stopping in and getting some ribs!

I went to this place because they catered one of my BFF's wedding receptions (yes, they had BBQ, get over it). ?It rocked then, and it rocks now.

It would get more stars if it changed locations (i.e. to HayesValley) and if it were cleaner.

In college I met some friends from Texas while on tour; they were in a band together and when they came through Cali they stayed at my house. ?I had promised them we would BBQ the next day and they all seemed very excited. ? Fast forward to the next afternoon and the look of disappointment on their faces when I pulled out the Weber grill and the hamburger patties. ? "I thought we were gonna BBQ?!?!?!" "That's what I'm doing." "That's not BBQ!" "WTF are you talking about?? ?What do you call this?" "Dude, you're just grilling." I then learned that what I had always known as a BBQ was just grilling and that real BBQ involved slow-cooking meat for several hours with all kinds of fancy sauces. ?This is the kind of BBQ you will find at Memphis Minnie's. ?Warm tender cuts of meat and delicious sides; and you HAVE to try the sauces, they are truly amazing. My only gripe is you don't always get that much food for your money, I dare say it is just slightly overpriced. ?But if you want to get a deal order the rib-tip plate which is the price of a sandwich but eats like a meal.

Now, it isn't the greatest Brisket that I've had, but for it's price, size and more importantly BBQ sauce it's become a favorite. It's pretty small inside and often times hard to find seating during peak times, but I think it's well worth the little wait, plus the staff is pretty entertaining to listen/talk to. The side dishes are quite yummy as well. Definitely a hot spot for some comfort food.

When I first moved to SF, I came here literally every day. ?Those were the days when they had hand pies(imagine a bbq empanada). ?And who can forget their weekend brunches with stuff like beef brisket omelets. ?also gone. My main beef (no pun intended) with Minnie's is: 1. they get rid of their best menu items for no reason (hand pies, armadillo eggs, etc) 2. they stopped brunch 3. ?there is high staff turnover and therefore the food is not consistent because there are always new people working the line. When they introduced their Wednesday Pastrami sandwich, it compared to the 2nd Ave Deli Pastrami in it's own unique way and that is almost impossible to do. ?(FYI, 2nd Ave Deli is what all these fake kosher-style Delis in the Bay area aspire to be) The last 2 times, I have ordered the Pastrami, it has been either dry and/or bland. Don't know if this is attributed to new staff on line Ditto for the Chicken Dinner. Was great 3 years ago, now eh. All bashing aside, It is still one of the best places to eat in the Bay area and the owner is Jewish, so I have to support my peoples. ?Just don't tell the Rabbi about the pork going on over there,

I'm underwhelmed by MM. While I'm not a BBQ aficionado, I have sampled a good amount of the stuff in California, the Carolinas and beyond. The first thing I noticed about MM was the relatively large/diverse menu. I'm accustomed to smaller, more focused selections at BBQ joints, and I'm weary of large menus because they indicate a lack of focus. I decided to split the spicy pulled chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potatoes. ?At over $8 with tax, this is a modestly sized meal. I agree with others that the side dishes are small, considering ala carte purchases are over $3. ?I was disappointed that the sandwich was cold, that the chicken wasn't marinated in BBQ sauce and that there was a mayonnaise like spread on the inside. I couldn't detect any heat in my spicy chicken. It tasted alot like a bland chicken salad sandwich. One star for 3 BBQ sauces on the table... they're the saving grace of an otherwise mediocre meal. One star for the atmosphere- very comfortable, if small. Head to Everett & Jones!!!

I use to go here for lunch when I worked in the city over 3 years. ?I was notorious for food runs and got a lot of people in the office to try this place. ?We would order meat by the pound which is the best way to go for a group. ?We usually get a full pound of the brisket, some ribs, and chicken. ?I've been back on my own to order enough to make some sandwiches with the left over brisket. I perfer this place over Big Nates which covers everything with sauce. ?I like having my sauce on the side and I like dry rub BBQ's over heavily sauce cooked BBQ. I didn't give them 5 stars because it can be a wait to get your food. ?Rule of thumb is that if you're getting take out, order about an hour earlier than when you plan to pick up. ? BTW I found it interesting when I was watching the travel channel a few weeks back on best BBQ across the states. ?Memphis Minnies was named on the show, who'd of thunk I've been going to this place for over 4 years.

Okay checked this place out after watching a review of the place on KQED's Check Please! Bay Area. I must say this place was good!!! I didn't want anything to deter me away from what I went there for, THE MEAT!! Oh my GOODNESS it was amazing!!! We had the brisket, baby back ribs and beef ribs. Brisket was moist and tender. With a great smoke ring around it. Baby Back ribs fell of the bone, but still had a slight bite to the outer layer. YUM Beef Ribs were ok, mainly bone and not much meat. I wouldn't order this again. I took out .5 of a star for the amount of tables. Only about 6 tables in the joint, but I guess that's SF for ya. And i took off another .5 of a star of the BBQ sauce. I know that this place wants to keep it as "Southern" as possible, but I'm a cali rib lover, so I like me thick, rich BBQ sauces. If you're like me and enjoy a wide sauce selection you'll have to check out Famous Dave's down in Gilroy. Otherwise Memphis Minnie's is the place to be!!!!

I admit, I went here because I saw the stellar reviews on "check please bay area". I have gone here at least three times. I feel like I went to a slot machine and on the first pull won a jackpot - so even though I don't always win, I still come back and play this slot machine. The first time I went here I fell in love. I came with a large group and we got to try almost all the entree on the menu - and it was all good. The meat fell off the bones of the ribs, the sausage was smoky and salty delicious, the brisket was soft and had a great sauce, the chicken was also fall of the bone tender and so tasty, everything - good. The sides were a mixed blessing but who cared after those great main dishes. I went back with a different group and it was good, but not as great as the first time. Also, no ribs, they all ran out. Next time, we did have the ribs but it was dry! The brisket was also dry and the sausage...dry (how is this possible?!?)! Now, when the entrees aren't as good, you start to notice the sides. I love mac and cheese and gain much pleasure in trying new mac and cheeses. Minnie's is wet. I'm not sure if this is a southern thing or what, but I don't like it. This was runny almost soupy mac and cheese. Yuck, I want cheesy gooey yummy cheese with cheese flavor on every piece of pasta. Not liquid cheese soup with pasta in it. Potato salad was average. So here are am with dry food and average sides. What was the saving grace for this meal. 1. alcohol. 2. the sauces on the table. With the sauces, even though th meat was dry it was a salvageable with the sauces on the table. Don't expect to sit down. We went on at 3PM on a Sunday and still had to wait. And by the time we left there was a line out the door. The workers are super cool though and won't let anyone sit down with out ordering first. They have crazy eagle eyes that WILL know if you're trying to grab a seat ahead of your turn. If you're against communal seating, I suggest you do take out. I like this since I like to talk to my stranger neighbors (stranger as in someone I have never met, not stranger as is more strange). Break down (break down do-wap do-wap): Food: 3-5 depending on what day you catch it Atmosphere: 2 hard to get a seat but once you do, enjoy it, talk to your neighbor and see what they like. My last neighbor loved her collard greens - I might try it next time Price: 3 It's more than I'd like to pay for BBQ but when it's good it's a bargain. When it's bad, it's not worth it. Regardless always worth the gamble. Final: 2.75 (I weigh food higher than the others) -3.75 So a solid 3.25 stars. But could be as good as a 3.75 stars! OK enough math. Oh! I totally forgot! The cheese grits fries are AWESOME!

I have a poor sense of direction and when I mentioned BBQ to my friend after attending the Chihulay exhibit at the DeYoung in GG park it had kicked into full gear. I thought we could walk to Haight and there it would be in all its porky goodness. Little did I know it would end up being a 2 mile hike. Boy, were we hungry when we arrived. I had the 2 way combo plate, meat # 1 was the St Louis ribs (nice smoke pinkness, very tasty with a combo of their regular Texas BBQ sauce which has a heavy spice content and a healthy dash of their HOT sauce), meat # 2 was the Beef Brisket, this was OMG good and I had plenty but I didn't share this moist and smoky meat. ?There was so much meat I let my ribs get cold and they transformed into dry nubs :(. I have to warn everyone about the greens they have a sweet mustardy flavor oddly interesting but very sweet. The mac and cheese had good flavor but soggy. The corn meal muffins look great but the use of stoneground grits is too hard for this recipe, I suggest a 1 hr soak in milk before baking. My friend had the smoked chicken plate and it was 1/2 a chicken, moist and meaty. She is from North Carolina and found the NC BBQ sauce lacking in heat, no matter how much we shook the sauce. But, the mustardy BBQ sauce was just right for the chicken. Nice folks and fast service.

Ugh. ?I had such high hopes for this place and was very eager to try it after seeing them profile it on "Check Please!" on KQED. ?Not only will I refuse to ever visit this place again, but that show has definitely lost all credibility with me. ? The food was terrible. ?The BBQ tasted like fuel or lighter fluid. ?I'm a big fan of meat and an even bigger fan of good BBQ, so I'd like to think I know my stuff when it comes to good BBQ. ?The meat was somewhat tender, but nothing takes away from the fact that your food tastes like fuel.

When it comes to BBQ, everybody has a different idea about what's good. I've been to Big Nate's and I thought I didn't like BBQ no more. My order: beef brisket+mac&cheese+fries+corn bread and 1/2 pound of Cajun Andouille sausage. Neil's order: combo of brisket, pulled pork, pork ribs+collard greens+mac&cheese+corn bread. "I'd love to see you finish all that" the dude behind the counter said. "You'd be surprised" I said, thinking "you have no idea" "You don't have to worry about this one" Neil said pointing at me. Brisket plate's portion was a little small for me but the 1/2 lb sausage and sides helped fill me up. I even help Neil finish his . . . Brisket was super tender and nicely charred and smoked on the outside. So juicy I almost didn't chew'em. Flavor could use a little bit more marinating . . . This is probably my Chinese side talking since we always marinate meat before BBQ-ing. Sorry to say that I like Chili's baby-back better than the pork ribs here . . . SOWWIE!!!! Mac&cheese was forgettable. Still love the mac&cheese at Home (the restaurant on church and market). I decided that first lining the meat with some of that vinegar and then mixing the South Carolina mustard and North Carolina red sauce was the best way to go =) Or did I get'em all mixed up?

This is a real find for " Q " eaters. ?The place has a down home, get comfy feel, with plenty of signs honoring their beloved pig . It is a very simple matter to both order -- at the counter -- and take a seat , in this clean well tended little restaurant. Despite previous posts about negative service, I discovered the counter staff to be patient, attentive and super courteous. ?Not unlike a visit to a typical Dallas BBQ. While a long way from Texas, the meat here just screams authentic. ?I can't stop ordering their brisket -- which is fraught with an aromatic smoky taste you will not soon forget . The slaw was also tasty , but a little lean in the portion. I suggest their cold pints of beer to complement the experience of some super BBQ. If they gave you a Kosher pickle with their plates, I would have to reward a FIFTH star. ?Great place for BBQ, with friendly service.

I have been wanting to come here for over two years and finally made it there today. I had seen them on Check Please Bay Area and was excited to hear all the great reviews. I'm a BBQ lover and seek out the best BBQ whenever I can. And since this place is only a few blocks from where I live, even better. Unfortunately, I didn't like it. From the start, I was greeted at the register where you place your order by some dreary guy who seemed miserable and talked like a slow robot. That aside, I ordered my BBQ pork sandwich with coleslaw; I like to put the coleslaw on the sandwich itself. When my order was called I picked up my sandwich. The initial appearance looked fine. The bread was probably the best part of the sandwich though. I was quickly disappointed to see that the slaw was vinegar based; I really love the mayo versions better on my sandwich. That aside, the sandwich was served dry so you could choose from 4 sauces that were on the table. I thought that was pretty cool and quickly did a sampling of all four. Unfortunately, I didn't really like them. The vinegar based sauce was too wet and just tasted like vinegar. The mustard sauce tasted just like runny generic yellow mustard. And the weirdest one was their standard red BBQ sauce. It was a bit too sweet but even weirder, it had this odd taste of curry! I couldn't really pin point the spice, but it had very aromatic undertones of curry. It was not good! So how can you enjoy a BBQ pork sandwich without a good sauce! And with the vinegar cole slaw I just did not enjoy it. I was really torn to get the brisket. It may be better, but the sauces will still suck. Maybe I'll order it to go and use my better BBQ sauces at home.

Ok, so full disclosure first: I automatically give 3 stars to any restaurant that I can crawl to from my home. ?In my pajamas. ?And I am not a strong crawler. ? But the sweet tea and brisket at Memphis Minnie's deserves that 4th star. ?And I heart the 4 pack of different sauces on the table (every bite can be a different flavor!). ?Love the texas red sauce, which is not too spicy, a little on the sweet side. The guys who work there are super friendly, and will let you take the pitcher of sweet tea to your table if you show up at the end of the night. ?R loved beer on tap to go with his meat. Bummer about the ribs, though. ?They have been on the dry side the last few times I have been in, and the corn bread muffin consistently tastes like a hockey puck.

Consistently good BBQ As you would expect from a decent BBQ place. The portions are large and the food has a smokey taste. Everything is great quality and the staff has always been nice and helpful. The dining experience is very fast food-ish which in great for lunch or if you are on your way to a show and just want to be in and out.

From the last time I've visited the quality of the food has changed. The cornbread was dry and the meat was burned. It was edible but disappointing since the previous experience was better. Maybe it was an off day.

I think I've tried most of the contents on this menu and my faves are the beef brisket, the BBQ Pork Rolls, Mac n Cheese and the Scratch Pecan Pie. ? All are bursting with flavor with or without their specialty sauces. ?I love the smoky flavors this place has to offer. ? The ribs are just ok, a little dry, cornbread a little dry, collard greens are vinegary, which I didn't like at first but now they've grown on me, so yes me likey. ?Wings are spicy if you like spicy, and the fries are just ok. ? ? It's nice to order take out, but if you eat in, I like how you can show up in sweats and get finger lickin with the fat rolls of paper towels, only for the fat rolls to then transfer onto your belly. ?Don't expect to wear tight jeans after eating here.

Boy howdy! I happened upon this place while visiting my pa' in SF. He mentioned this place and whipped out a menu, proceeding to order the prepared playes. BAH! I yelled...you don't order prepared plates at a place like this...you order BY THE FRIGGIN' POUND! So...$112 later, we had a feast! And I agree with many of the postings here...the brisket was some of the finest I have EVER had. Ribs weren't worthy and the sausage wasn't my kind...but they were good. 2-day post feast report: I am proud to report that we have achieved "Fire in the hole!" after this one! I just may up my rating to a 5 based on this alone! WOOOHOOO!

When I'm gettin' my carnivore on, I head to Memphis Minnie's, order a plate of rib tips with beans and greens, douse them in all three sauces, and dig in. Mmmm. Meat. Everyone seems to love the banana pudding, but I am not a pudding fan. If I have room for dessert -- and that's a BIG "if" given the size of the bbq plates -- I get a slice of sweet potato pie. Mmmm. Pie.

I've only eaten here once, when it was almost closing time. They were out of their supposedly 'famous' brisket, out of fries. I got the smoked pork sandwich (I was in a pulled pork mood, but no pulled pork on the menu) w/ mac n' cheese. I don't know why people rave about the mac n' cheese here so much, i thought it was nasTAY, give me kraft's "the cheesiest" over minnie's slop (and it did resemble actual slop) anytime. Or maybe it was the fact that I sat at the table facing the bathroom which didn't help make eating any more appetizing... So, lesson here: Don't sit at the tables near the bathroom (the 2 in the back). But when I was there (about 9:40p? on a Tuesday) the place was packed and there was no other choice. The smoked pork sandwich itself was ok, but i had to spit out some gristly parts. I was urged by friends not to make up my mind about this place until I try the brisket. But I know of much better bbq's in the bay area & probably will not go back unless i'm in the neighborhood again & everywhere else is closed. On the plus side, I do like how you get a choice of 3 sauces, in bottles at your table - allowed me to try all 3, alternating between different bites.

This place has spoiled me for BBQ anywhere else. Everything is very good. The staff is a little on the surly side- think "no BBQ for you!"- but of course that itself adds a certain charm. As does the miniscule portion of delicious mac and cheese- something like 3 bucks for 2 mouthfulls- but oh, what a mouthfull! The coleslaw redefines coleslaw. Bitchin' brisket. BUT: I'm going to join the chorus here, and ding them a star for how paltry the sides are. 3 bites of Mac and cheese for $2.25? Culinary blue balls. No me gusta. And the snotty staff is less of a charm each time I have to face it, actually, and so I darken their door less than I otherwise might. Joke's on you, jack!

The BBQ is too bland for my taste. It seems like they don't spice it up and marinate it long enough before putting it on the pit. The pork ribs I had last night weren't falling-off-the-bone tender like I like 'em, and I've been disappointed in the brisket in the past. I really, really like the fried catfish, but they're out of it 50% of the time that I try to order it. Sheesh, last night they were out of half the items on the menu. Admittedly, we did waltz in 15 minutes before closing. And the greens. Why oh why do I keep ordering the greens? There's 2 camps when it comes to flavoring greens. One is the vinegar camp, and the other is the pork product camp (bacon, salt pork, ham hock, etc.). I fall solidly into the latter. I keep a big hunk of salt pork in my freezer just for making giant pots of excellent greens. Sadly, Memphis Minnie's is way in the vinegar camp. It's pretty much like eating a cup of vinegar. The beans I had last night were awful. Seems like they hadn't been soaked or cooked long enough, and they were crunchy. At least they threw some pork into the pot for those, though. They have a new sauce, called "It's Stupid Hot Sauce" or something which was really good and REALLY spicy. It salvaged my pork ribs. The service is friendly. And I'll probably keep going back, because when I stumble out of Toronado after several beers, BBQ always seems like such a good idea, and I'm too drunk to remember that disappointment awaits.

This is the only place in town I can get my sake and rib fix at the same time. ? ?Pork ribs, mustard sauce, and cole slaw on the side. ? ?There is rarely a long wait here and it seems to cater mainly to locals. ? Surprisingly the sake menu is pretty good for a rib joint. ? Come to think of it, it is pretty good sake menu even if it was a sushi joint and considering that the nearest sushi place in the lower haight blows you may want to just go here anyway.

Me likey! Brisket was excellent! Ribs are pretty damn good, but a little bit dry. Drench them bukkake style with the signature Memphis Minnie's sauce to fix that right up. Pork pulled sandwich was average in my opinion because that was so dry that no amount of sauce could save it. I tried 4 sides (mac & cheese, sweet potatoes, potato salad, cornbread) and they were all very plain and average like yo mama. The potato salad wasn't very fresh. Corn bread somewhat stale/old. And the mac + cheese needs more cheesiness & kick. Basically, I think I could make better sides than these guys. Staff is super friendly. Decor is pretty cool with all these pig toys, statues, figurines, pictures, etc. Make no mistake about it, the strength of this place lies in it's meat. Forget about everything else.

After seeing "Memphis Minnie's" featured on PBS Check Please Bay Area, my hubby and I decided to pay this place a visit. We got there around 6:30pm and the line to order food was out the door. All the tables were packed so we thought it may be better if we order take outs instead. We stood in line nevertheless and went through the menu. That kept us busy while waiting in line. We ordered the following 2 dishes: (a) Meat Two way combo: St. Louis Pork Ribs and Santa Maria Tri-Tip Steak Plate. It comes with 2 sides and I chose potato salad and potlikker greens (b) Meat Two way combo: Texas Big beef Ribs and Beef Brisket. 2 sides included Fries and Mac N Cheese They ran out of all desserts except for the Banana Pudding so we passed. ?We wanted to order th Pecan Pie. By the time we ordered, the tables emptied so we decided to eat in and got seats right away. Then it was a wait for the food to come out. A couple right in front of us ordered To Go and they waited just as long... so there is really no shorter wait for take out. We got our food after 20 minutes or so. I must say that the food is overrated. The meats are dry and bland. We ended up pouring tons and tons of sauce (they have 3 for you to choose from) on the meats to get some flavors out of it. Quite disappointed. I've had better BBQ... but their business will probably continue to prosper because there is a niche of good ol' Southern soul food in the Bay Area. People tend to always associate old, funky places like these a gem. To me, it's one of those restaurants that I can say, "Been there, Done that." I can now move on.

We ordered the rib plate and the pork plate. ?The ribs were dry and overcooked, when I got home I found that they gave us 3 ribs that looked like they had been hanging around the bottom of the oven for a few days. ? The "sweet slow cooked pork" was not sweet nor did they cook it long ?or slow enough. ?Normally to properly slow cook pork it is cooked in a low oven 12-24 hours (the really good stuff is cooked 24 hours). ?This cooks off the fat (which pork shoulder is full of) and flavors the meat. ?The pork shoulder they serve here is cooked maybe 3 hours. ?It is full of fat, is tough, and has no flavor, (no wait, it tastes like undercooked pork shoulder which tastes like crap unless you drown it in their sauce in which case it will taste like -- surprise -- their sauce). ?Also these plates cost wayyy too much! ?$13.95 for a meager plate of dry ribs, $11.95 for a pork plate. ?The coleslaw was too sweet, vinegar based; the potato salad was ok and the corn bread was ok. I avoided this place for years because it looked like what it is: an overpriced, yuppified, fast-food version of BBQ. ?I guess if I "didn't know what BBQ is supposed to taste like" I would think it was just fine. ?But come on people! ?Get out and be a little adventurous. ?BBQ may be a hard find on the west coast but it is out here... but if you are looking for a nice, sanitized restaurant with a Mickey Mouse mascot I guess this is your place!

I was very disappointed with this place, in looking at some other reviews it just seems like I went on an "off" day. I went to school in the South and am particular about my BBQ, but really don't consider myself a food snob. I had the pulled pork (dry, with the seasoning overpowering the taste of the pork), sweet potatoes (ok), mac & cheese (not very cheesy, with an odd mustardy aftertaste) and the cornbread (very dry). I tried the pork ribs, which were also dry and overwhelmingly spiced (with cumin?) and the greens, which were actually pretty tasty - tangy, sort of like shredded pickles. The mustard sauce was nice, but the bbq sauces were forgettable. At any rate, if you like a modern twist on traditional barbecue then you may want to check out this place. If you're like me though and are more into the artery-clogging Southern style (flavorful yet non greasy meat falling off the bone, moist barely sweet cornbread, mac & cheese swimming in grease, etc) then feel free to skip this joint.

I have to say that although I'm not the hugest of dry rub YET. A lot of my friends tell me the sauce makes you wonder more, and yes for BBQ sauce i did want more. The rub itself did taste good but I wouldn't call it the best in the city. The sides were OK. I would def go back to try more, but I'm still searching for the end all to end all BBQ in the city.

I'd heard a bit about Memphis Minnie's and was chomping at the ?bit to give it a try. I met up with 3 other friends to check it out. I loved the casual "pig" decor and the brightly colored outside. The Haight is a really cool area in general. The outside of Minnie's fits right in with the neighborhood. Minnie's is small inside but that's cool for BBQ. ?The first thing I noticed was how uninviting the guy behind the counter was. I mean the guy was like Joe Friday...no smile, no personality...just the facts. I'm used to walking into restaurants and being greeted with at least a little warmth. But anyway onto the BBQ. My friend's hooked a up a couple of appetizer's:BBQ Seasoned Fries and the Beef Brisket Chili. I've got to give it to them for creativity. And the food was pretty good. ?Not a complaint from anyone. By the time our 4th arrived and we got ready to order the main dishes, a much friendlier guy was working the counter and he recommended the beef brisket. Of course we obliged! We also through in some Smoked Pork RIbs, and Combo plates to get a good tasting of as much as possible. I have to say the meat was seasoned well and cooked practically to perfection(i.e. moist, tender and not dry). They offer 3 different sauces: one was a tangy mustard type sauce, I think a second one was either KC or St. Louis style and I honestly don't remember the third. They weren't bad just nothing memorable. All in all I'd definitely return for another try but I wouldn't go out of my way for a second visit.

Finally! ?Great barbecue food that doesn't involve taking an airplane or even BART. I love love love barbecue so much that I learned to cook it when I moved here from England and I had been serially disappointed with each of the BBQ joints I'd tried here in the city. You can smell Memphis Minnie's as you walk own Haight with the familar odour of mesquite wood and charcoal mixed with meat fumes and every time I've been there there has been a line and a wait for tables. If I were to judge this place on the ambience then I might knock a star off as the place is pretty tired looking but when you sink your teeth into that sweet sweet barbecue any reservations over the decor will disappear. I think I've tried every one of the meats on the menu now and can say that the smoked sausage and the brisket are the stars of the show but there really isn't a bad thing on the menu. ?The corn bread however isn't that great, I make better in my own kitchen, but then of course I'd say that. Barbecue food is so regionally divisive and the best thing about being a fish out of water is that they are able to provide barbecue sauces from all over the south without invoking the ire of the locals. ?Personally the mustardy Carolina sauce is my favourite but you have sweet Texas and one other to choose from. Their Collard Greens almost made me weep with joy as I am a sucker for a good plate of greens and I did chuckle at the customer who, when told that they were out of ribs asked the chef to stick some on for him. ? The chef said he'd oblige but he might have to wait a while for them to cook, the customer undeterred said this was fine and asked how long. ?The reply? ?8 hours. ?Brilliant.

I don't understand how anyone can think this is 4 star barbeque. i guess not everyone has been to the South or experienced authentic bbq. Memphis Minnies would not last a week in Memphis. Dirty tables and decor, dry food, mediocre sides, all in all relatively tasteless unless you drown it in their subpar sauce. And it's not cheap to boot. Oh well, you take what you can get.

They had been cooked so well I accidentally started eating a bone. ?I poop you not. I was chewing on one of my ribs thinking "I should have hit bone by now." ?I actually had but it was so soft I couldn't tell. ?That's a sign of some gooood down home cooking. ?It didn't splinter into pieces, just sort of fell apart in my mouth (mmmm...boooones). ?If I were a dog I'd be lov'n this place. ?I'd probably write some like "Woof! ?Bark,bark,bark woof!" ?Then knock over a lamp with my frisky tail wagging.

So I've only had take out from here brought to me by a friend, which means I may have missed a killer restaurant ambiance and experience. ?I got a pulled pork sandwich and my reviews are a little mixed. ?Not a whole lot of flavor in the meat and a pretty sparse sandwich, but the sides of coleslaw and beans were pretty bomb. ?I liked their variety of sauces, but good meat shouldn't need too much sauce, and their BBQ sauce was actually the worst one! I tried my friends ribs and they were decent but nothing to jump for. ?I think the only reason I wasn't disappointed by this meal was the fact that I had just watched Wall-e a couple times and was glad I wasn't being a fat ass drinking my meals out of a cup...just a fat ass eating a sandwich.

On a typical cold day in July, me and my friend decided that it was time for a little Minnie's to counteract the events of the day. Our reason for going to Memphis was to enjoy comfort food on a day that required more comforting. As always, the staff is friendly and the place is pig-licious and the sweet tea...yummy, however our LAST visit to Memphis was unsatisfactory. I ordered the same thing I always order, rib tips and memphis sweet-smoked pork with greens and BBQ fries. Rib tips a little on the tough side, the sweet smoked pork was decent, the greens were too sweet and sour (and not in a good way) and my fries...what could go wrong with the fries...NOTHING, they were good. My friend decided to have some kind of roasted meat, which was a small portion of meat with gravy over it. Nonetheless, we ate as much as we could before feeling like it was time to unbutton the top button on the jeans. I was feeling a bit barf-ish, but blamed it on the amount of meat we just ate. That night I went home and the feeling was even worst. Cramping in the stomach and a somewhat vomit-ish taste in my mouth....ewwww, i know, gross...right? ?The following day, I called my friend and she said the same thing....cramping and barfy...except, she actually barfed that morning. We ordered different things...and still, we got the same feeling. Either we got food poisoning from this place or...we're on the same barf cycle. We're not going back...sorry Memphis Minnie's...we loved you before, but don't any more.

Pros: - pulled chicken sandwich, coleslaw, mac n' cheese - the sauces are quite good cons: - call ahead 'cause the line and wait can be a bit long - staff can be a bit rude: I see them yelling at chefs sometimes and don't dare sit down before you get your food or face the wrath - the burger is basically just that: meat in between a bun (no condiments). Sure, this might be traditional BBQ (I have no idea) but I love lettuce, tomato, and pickle on my burgers.

Two dudes cookin, one guy orders. ?Took about 20 min for me to wait for the meat to go (at around 4:30pm), and two orders were in front of me and looks like that took a while. ?Now....I had no sandwich assembly, no sides to pack up. ?Just meat in a box. ?And as we know with BBQ.....you're not cooking it for me, you're just cutting it off what's already done....so why the long wait Minnie's??

I called for over $100.00 of food at 11am for pre-super bowl party 2:30pm pickup. ? I arrived at 2:40pm and waited in line. ?When I got to the front, they had not fired my order yet. ? I don't really know what happened next. ?However, forty five minutes later I still did not have my food and I watched at least twenty orders walk out the door. ?Clearly, they just decided to fire my order just like I had waited in line. ? So, there is absolutely nothing to be gained by ordering ahead of time. ? Being late is fine, but putting me at the end of the line is not. ? They did offer me a cookie. ? This place is incompetent. ?Stay away. ?Its the second time this same thing has happened to me. ?I am not going to Memphis anymore!

I'm writing this update because I've been back to this place on more than one occasion since my last review and let me just say... Wow. If you get here on a Wednesday you are OBLIGED to get the Ruben Sandwich. Or at least something with the GODLY pastrami that they only make and serve once a week. It was one of those "holy" experiences that sticks in your brain for weeks... nay, months.... (possibly years?) ?Yes, I will never forget that ridiculous pastrami goodness. And, I must admit, after trying a few other things again (especially the brisket and sides... like the deliciously saucy mac n cheese) I've bumped them up a star and am seriously considering two, based on that pastrami alone. Screw it, they earned it. Yes, go here. Damn, I wish it was Wednesday.

I have to confess, I have been going to Memphis Minnie's about once a week for almost a year now. ?Why? ?Thursday is FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH day! ?I would put this against anybody else's (Even Bakesale Betty's). ? ?The chicken, the slaw, the bread... its the perfect bad-for-you sandwich. ?I'm also a big fan of the brisket.

I really, really wanted to give Memphis Minnie's a better review. ?I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with corn bread and an order of their appetizer ribs. ?My buddy ordered the pulled pork and some seasoned fries. ?Total came out to around $40, so not too bad for a BBQ place in SF. If this review was just based off their pulled pork it would be 4-star worthy. ?The pork was tender and the roll they put it on was great. ?Butttt......the rest of the food was blah. ?It was criminal how bad the ribs were. ?You go to a BBQ place and expect at least passable ribs. ?These were dry, tough and just plain gross. ?It almost looked,felt and tasted like beef jerky. ?I know ribs are hard to make but I would be embarrassed to serve these ribs to anyone I wanted to stay friends with. ?I got delivery and I know the food won't be as good as eating there, but there is just no excuse for how bad these ribs were. ?The cornbread was very dry as well but I'll chalk that up to getting delivery. ?I wasn't the biggest fan of their sauces but I know that is more of a personal thing then anything else, my buddy seemed to really like both the basic BBQ sauce and the more mustardy BBQ sauce. ?We asked for a ton of sauce on the side and they were not skimpy at all, they probably gave us 10-12 small containers of it, which was great. One side note with customer service, I hate to pile on a restaurant when they are trying to do their best but you charge $3 for delivery (the dude rides a bike, I totally get charging money for it) but then I tipped on top of the delivery charge and when I closed the front door I hear the delivery guy say "three bucks???". ?That kind of rubbed me the wrong way. ?You want me to tip you $10 to ride your bike 8 blocks?? ?If the food was awesome I could overlook a little attitude, but when you deliver mediocre( at best) food, then cut the BS. ? I would go back for the pulled pork in a heart beat but skip everything else that has to do with this place. ?Step up your BBQ game Memphis Minnie's. ?As one of the only BBQ places in SF I was hoping/wishing you guys would be my go to for some good BBQ but I guess my search continues.

OK. ?So I was listening to T Bone Walker yesterday afternoon, and had a desire to eat some BBQ, who would have figured that? ?I looked on Yelp for the best BBQ in town, and this is what they gave me. ?It was PACKED. ?They had a sake obsession, so I got some beer. ?The food took a while, but that's only because there were so many people there before us. ?I got the St. Louis style ribs with slaw and sweet potatos. ?The slaw was not very good, I can't even describe why. ?I think this is entirely subjective (obviously), but there was one shread of cabbage in it. ?Weird. ?The sweet potatoes tasted like apple sauce (bonus!), and the rib tips were chewy (sign of too-fast cooking), but the rib parts were delicious. ? I'm not giving it 5 because I had to wait, the cole slaw, and the tips of my ribs. ?I will be returning here whenever I want BBQ, however. ?I was told to try the Pork rolls (like egg rolls) and sake.

Stumbled on this place en route to the Under One Roof sale several weeks ago. We ordered two sandwiches; beef brisket and pulled pork. Both are served dry with their variety of sauces available for self-dressing on the table. The offering included a vinegar sauce, a "Stupid Hot" habanero sauce, a mustard sauce, and a classic sweet BBQ sauce. On the whole, while the meat was decent enough (although slightly dry), I was not Wowed by any of the sauces, finding the classic BBQ almost Oriental for some reason. The sides, on the other hand, were pretty fabulous; collard greens that were hefty and vinegary, chunked yams, and an interesting cole slaw with large slices of bell pepper and more. The restaurant itself is part of the attraction with a long banquet of tables and chairs with red checkered cloths, ample paper towels, fun t-shirts on the walls from competitors, and tons of pig paraphernalia. They also played great music. Doubtful I'll go back based on the sauce alone, but they do seem to have other things going for them including a fried catfish dish and several weekly specials so who knows...

We went there yesterday night and I guess we went at the wrong time because we were doing laps around the neighborhood for half an hour! ?My sister raved about this place and said this was #1 on their BBQ list. ?(I should've yelped it first...oh well.) Take the bus there if you can. ?The parking sucked!!! ?But I guess you can say it was a good way to get the appetite going cuz by the time we got to the place, we were hungry as heck! I like the environment a lot -- all those piggies looking at you. ?=) ?We ordered the taster ($16.95), which included your choice of three meats and 2 side dishes. ?We chose to get 2 pork ribs and the beef brisket for meats, fries and beans as our side dishes. ? Beef brisket was good -- nice and soft, not chewy at all -- kind of like melt in your mouth type. ?The beans were good as well -- not too soggy or blah. ?Now, the ribs were good but too dry. ?We got jipped man! ?We got like burnt pieces or something. ?And the fries were not that great. ?They were too dry and krispy. ?And I didn't really like the spice powder on them -- it was funny tasting to me. ?Oh, we also got the sweet potato pie with whipped cream ($3.95) and it was pretty good! ?And their cornbread was pretty good as well. ?And I didn't really like their sweet potatoes either. ?Soda pop was $1.95. ? Oh, and when you're trying their sauces, don't put too much of the hot sauce. ?On the bottle, it said "it's stupid hot" and man..it was hot! ?I usually like spicy stuff and this did it for me. ?Try their mustard and red sauce. ?They were pretty good! ? Now, would I go back? ?Probably not due to their parking issues! ?I don't think it was worth our 30 minutes of circling around the neighborhood. ?If I was in the neighborhood for something, then MAYBE we'll drop by..but that's about it. ?I wouldn't go to the neighborhood just for this place.

Oh cruel mistress. why do you torment me so. I didn't even break my cardinal rule of no night time Q. But it didn't matter, for the hope of my weekend BBQ fantasy was dashed upon the rocky crags of mediocre meat. There IS something wrong with me if I can't even capitalize m.... me..... Sigh.... Meat. Though normally a great feast... (The Lady and I have devoted almost equal time between here and Nates) this feast was dry and, well... overcooked. The Pork Ribs looked like they had been sliced and left on top of a hot shelf for at least an hour before finding their way into our trough. Though we could tell they had been tender once, they had dried out too far to be the succulent morsels I've grown accustom to. The Big Beef Bones were about the same... maybe not quite as dry, but they cooked too hard I think. (Though the Rub sill tasted great!) Brisket... and Sweet Pork... same story. I've said it before, BBQ can be a fickle lover, and I picked the wrong day to come a'calling without flowers. Please know that I do... really like these guys. Hell, even the music today was great... a bluegrass rendition of Pink Floyd's Lucifer Sam, followed by a bluegrass Under The Bridge.... Regardless, onward and upward. Good sides. Potlicker Greens are great, Mac is average in texture, better in flavor, and even the Cole Slaw doesn't turn me away. Corn Muffins are some of the better I've had in the local Q joints. We like the Pecan Pie (out today). But in its place decided that the Banana Pudding and Sweet Potato Pie would be the answer, and lo... we came out ahead on that call. (Whew!) So the rating... they were on the High side of a 3.5 before today... which brought it crashing down to the low side. Hence 3*** (for the time being). I will go back. Rest assured. I will go back

Almost didn't dine at Memphis Minnie's because of our large group of seven people, but I'm still amazed we all managed to sit together on a busy Saturday night. I think it'd be tough for even a group of 4. The pork was great, especially with the Texas Red sauce. I was really looking forward to my sides of Mac&Cheese and Corn Bread but was disappointed. I'd say skip the sides and save room for one of their delicious pies.

This place is pretty average, even by California standards. I'm not sure what type of wood they use, but if I had to guess, I'd say apple, although I now see from all the press that he uses white oak. Almost everything I ate had a taste of apple, even the meat that didn't have the Texas Red Sauce. That sauce was terrible by the way. It tasted ?like a bad version of Kentucky-style apple cider-based sauce. Brisket was the best of the sandwich meats and moist but lacked any real punch. Maybe I just prefer a more aggressive rub. It looked like it had a nice smoke ring but lacked that deep, smoky flavor. Throw some more hickory logs on the fire, Bob! The pork was dry and flavorless. A real disappointment considering the place has Memphis in its name. The fries were excellent. Probably the only thing I truly enjoyed about the meal. The beans, despite being loaded with meat, lacked much flavor. They need more heat, more ?salt.....something. The mustard sauce was mustard sauce, the vinegar was vinegar sauce. No complaints there. But if you're going to be all over the map, why not get some KC-style sauce. Maybe even put burnt ends on the menu.

Came for early dinner on Saturday (6pm), and the place was starting to get crowded. For the 4 of us, we ordered: 1. Memphis Sweet Smoked Pork Sandwich, side of beans 2. Pulled Spicy Chicken Sandwich, side of fries 3. Minnie's Tasters: tri tip, beef brisket, pork ribs, sides Mac & Cheese, ?beans; came with Cornbread We found the food to be a little on the bland side; the pork ribs a bit dry. Cornbread was good; mac and cheese was ok. The bbq sauces were, hmm just OK.. It was worth a try bec of all the hype and recommendations from my friends. ?I probably won't make a special trip just to come here. ?I'd go to Everett & Jones instead.

This place was good not great. I really wanted to love it. First off - it is TINY inside so you're lucky to get a seat on a busy night. The service I found to be very unfriendly. The spicy pulled chicken sandwich was good - I'd get it again. The thing I do like about this place is the variety of sauces on each table from spicy mustard to vinegar. I was disappointed with the mac and cheese - it was a weird consistency, had a funky taste to it and was luke warm - I'd skip that next time. Oh and they have sake to wash it all down with.

I heart this place. ?I'm serious. ?Memphis Minnie's is the s#*t. ?I've eaten there many, many times and thus far they can do no wrong. Tonight a couple friends got some take-out from MM and brought it over to my apartment. ?From what I remember, we had the brisket, sweet smoked pork, ribs (not sure which ones) and sausage. ?For sides, we had the mac & cheese, slaw & smoked pit beans. ?A great assortment and EVERYTHING was good. ?Especially the, well, all the meats, and the mac & cheese. ?But the other sides were good, too. ?They have 3 different BBQ sauces; a mustard based one, a vinegary sweet one and something called North Carolina that is a little thinner and full of spices. ?All the sauces are great and I tend to have all 3 containers in front of me which I alternate between. ?This place makes me feel like (and sound like) a gluttonous pig, but its really that good. MM claims that sake is the best accompaniment for BBQ and I'm eager to go in and try that out sometime. ?We had a great bottle of Argentinian white that did the trick.

I was so pleasantly surprised at the superb quality of the food I had! I had pulled pork, pit beans and coleslaw. The pulled pork was exactly the way it should be, the pit beans were exactly what you might expect as well. The coleslaw and sauces really set this place apart from the masses. The coleslaw, though sweet, contained some chewy marinated green peppers and was really very good with the BBQ. They had three kinds of sauce on each table. I opted for the traditional Carolina Mustard Sauce, because it is traditional with pork. OUTSTANDING! :-) It was a huge portion and you know? I ate every bit of it. Oooh! I almost forgot. Stella Artoise on tap. Yummy with the BBQ!

I've eaten at Memphis Minnies four or five times now and believe that it's in the Bay Area's top five BBQ places (Bo's in Lafayette is another). ?They utilize a refigerator sized smoker to barbecue their meats and as a result ?the stars of the show are very good, flavorful and tender large meat cuts (i.e. beef brisket, pork shoulder). ?The non-large meats cuts (ribs, chicken, links) are pretty good but not quite as distinctive. Being Memphis style they emphasize the rub rather than the sauce so the meat is served alone and you can add different sauce types (Texas, N Carolina, S Carolina) at your table. ?If you are attached to the "wet" KC style then it may not be the place for you. They also serve pretty goods sides (don't miss the greens) and desserts as well. ?They also have a couple of nice beer taps (Stella, Anchor Steam) to help bring it all down. ?Very nice and highly recommended.

I loved it. I had the brisket plate. It's so tender it just falls apart. I really liked the vinegar sauce they have at the tables. My friend ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and repeatedly declared, "This is so good!". It was a bit expensive and the portions aren't huge like I was expecting. That was fine with me, I'm used to getting more than I can eat at BBQ restaurants. I'm glad it wasn't crowded when I went, I've heard it gets busy and it didn't look like it would be very comfortable when crowded.

This is my new favorite bay area BBQ joint period. I was told about this place from a coworker and when I was working in the city for a couple week i thought id go check it out. We were working up the street on Fillmore and took a walk down the hill past the crazy old guy with turrets who likes to yell look over here and then smile and look away or my favorite OATMEAL!! then he giggles. Oh man love the crazies in the city. Anywhoo back to Memphis. So I ended up liking this place so much I went here for like a week and a half straight. Ive tried damn near everything on the menu. My favorite is the tri-tip sangwich with mac n cheese side.If it wasn't so piggly I would have drank the rest of the mac sauce out of the cup. The beans are magical sweet smokey with a dash of cinnamon. the BBQ sauces are great my fav is the mustard based sauce which you can buy for like 6 bucks there. Smoke chickens are out of control my work partner and i decided to hog out get a couple sandwiches and share a whole chicken. Oh man that was a long walk back up the hill, I need a ski rope tied around me to be pulled back up the hill. ribs are falling off the bone nummalicious. chicken wings should be illegal.maybe if we shot the chef to restore order and balance amongst those who BBQ.. there shoe string onion rings are like crack. maybe they sneak meth or something into there food because it really is addicting. lemme tell you about pastrami Wednesday... this is the only day they have pastrami and a pastrami Reuben. I went deep on the Reuben.. it was so big and glutinous i had to remove most of the cheese and sauerkraut in order to pick it up and eat it.Im mean dont get me wrong i like tasty food but there is a line when you look at it and your just like yeah no i cant eat all that. they also have a sanwich that is in trial right now that isn't on the menu... THANKSGIVING SANGWICH!!!! I like thanksgiving.... Sourdough roll, Smoked Turkey, Stuffing, gravy and cranberry with sweet potato goodness on the side.....you pig!! yes i am. You must try this place i cant believe its only been open under 2 years,its gotta a cool old school southern vibe and they place kick ass old school blues music. I gained 12lbs i think while eating here everyday for a week and a half, but its all good i ate well for the next month and took care of that.

I've had better. That's right. I said it. The food is OKAY; when I went with a group of friends we all tried different types of BBQ and I think that the beef brisket is probably the best out of everything. I had the beef brisket sandwich and I thought there was too much bread to the amount of meat, and actually ended up just leaving a lot of the bread on my plate. The fries were okay, not incredible. The sides were... interesting, not memorable.

I really don't know what all the hype about this place is. I'm a HUGE fan of BBQ, American to Polynesian. This place sure disappoints and the quality of meat used would probably help its cause. From two different occasions, I've tried the ribs, chicken wings and the pulled pork, coleslaw and mac n' cheese. The meat was stringy and chewy, the wings were hairy and low grade. Pulled pork? Generic. I love coleslaw, but the coleslaw is not my style. I would think that should call it vinaigrette salad instead. Don't even get me started to the mac n' cheese - cakey and generic as well.

Not worthy of any kind of hype. The BBQ was served cold, dry and overpriced. If you're into that sort of thing then by all means go to Memphis Minnies, but if you're looking for genuinely good BBQ that you don't have to make excuses for then you should make the trip out ?to Everette and Jones in Oakland. MM was so bad on the day we went that the folks sitting next to us walked away with their food mostly untouched, which I probably would've done myself were it not for the fact that I was very hungry. So, yes, I did eat the cold ribs and bland andouille sausage in the unremarkable bbq sauce (even the "stupid hot" bbq sauce wasn't spicy enough). Yes, I ate the slimy brisket which was half comprised of fat. I ate the shamefully stale corn muffin. Why does this place get such high ratings? Stockholm Syndrome is my guess. San Francisco restaurants are so hit and miss that when people find a restaurant that is merely average we start lining up around the block. How would they know they serve bad BBQ if fools are queuing up for this place everyday? I'll give it two stars because I've encountered far worse and I don't feel that they meant to do me any specific harm.

I've been thinking about BBQ since the YELP- O-GRAM was sent. ?Memphis Minnie's among others are listed. ?So...offI go in search of the goods to quence the ache. Yes it ached. ? Memphi Minnie's it is. Found parking easily, that's a big plus for sure. It smells so good. Almost reminds me of Black's BBQ in TX (which you can order and they will ship and oh baby..it's worth it). ? I decide on the pork rib, beans and potato salad. ?I took it to go...which may have been a mistake, but good bbq lasts. ? I get home, and the ribs are looking really dry and overcooked. So either A. they were getting rid of stuff that didn't sell or B. they really do suck at cookin' the ribs...which I just can't imagine. ?I got through one rib (there were about 5 or 6, my thought was they'd be good for leftovers) and had to stop. The meat was really too dry and no amount of sauce was going to change that. ?VERY DISAPPOINTING. I have to say the Beans were awesome as was the salad. ?So...although I was really bummed that i had to take a drink of water after each bite, I think I will give it a 2nd chance and try the brisket or beef ribs. My fingers are crossed for a better experience.

MEMPHIS MINNIES is a cool stand in for real BBQ for those of you not willing to travel to East or North Bay. Although a tad expensive for BBQ, Memphis Minnies offers a fine selection of dishes that will appease the most stubborn bbq eater. The only downsides to this place (beside the price) is that the portions are a tad small, and parking is non-existent since its located in the lower Haight. The meat, although yummy, could be seasoned a bit better. But when you smother it with your favorite sauce, you will hardly notice. BTW... The Sweet Tea is daaaaaaangerous is you DONT want a sugar high! lol

ehhhhhh.... overrated. I ordered the 2-meat combo, which came with 2 sides and corn bread. My meat choices: brisket and pork ribs. the ribs were dry and didn't fall off the bone too easily. brisket... burnt and super dry. for sides, I chose seasoned fries and mac&cheese. seasoned fries were alright, partially because they were also burnt. mac&cheese, I do a way better job at making it. Babe chose the andouille sausage and smoked pork. now, these two items were decent. pork was quite tender and the smokey flavor made it even better. andouille sausage was a bit over cooked and lacked a kick. all in all I was super disappointed. I'd prefer Everett & Jones or Gorilla BBQ any day.

We have eaten here numerous times and the food is usually great. We have even ordered delivery once before. Tonight we called to order delivery again and the woman who answered the phone said she needed to check the delivery area (which is online and we are inside of it.) She neglected to put us on hold and we could hear her mocking us on the phone to her co-worker and did not even thoroughly check the delivery area. When asked if we would like to pick up the food, we said no thanks. We will gladly take our business to people who are friendly exhibit proper customer service.

Finally I've found something that's almost like Texas bbq! ?If you're hankering for some authentic Texas bbq, Memphis Minnie's is as close as you'll get to the real deal. ?The brisket is DEE-LICIOUS as are the pork ribs, but stay away from the pulled pork. ?It was below-average and much too dry for my taste. ?The collared greens are good as well although it's up to individual tastes as to the other side dishes. Try out the restaurant's sauces. ?The Texas and Carolina sauces go great with any of the meat although the quality of the bbq is good just on its own. This is a comfortable restaurant to chow down at. ?I will definitely be back when I get a craving for meat! ?Yee-haw to that!

I'm from Kansas City, so realize I've been spoiled with some of the country's best sauces and smoked meat for most of my life. ? My meal & what I though: Beef Brisket Sandwich - the brisket was dry and overcooked, this probably could have been ovecome if they would have slathered the meat with some warm sauce - good rub and decent smokiness, but it was dry - it was on a crusty hoagie roll- this is just a bad combination, tough rolls don't go with barbeque- buttery, toasty, soft rolls and wonderbread are better - how 'bout some pickles? French Fries - EXCELLENT, enough said Beans - Not saucy enough, forgettable Sauce - Pretty damn good, I had to use plenty - The mustard sauce is nice This is a pretty good place, don't get me wrong. ?I'm used to a place that smokes meat for days in a hickory pit and makes hickory pit beans. ?(Hickory Pit Beans are beans that are made literally in the same smoke pit as the meat. ?The brisket drips tasty goodness into the bean pit as the meat smokes.) ?I want to leave a BBQ place with sticky fingers, a BBQ sauce stain on my t-shirt, tender meat stuck in my teeth, and the aroma of hickory in my clothes. ?This ain't gonna happen at Memphis Minnies. The real deal for barbeque lovers: http://www.jackstackbbq.¡­ - the best BBQ you've ever had straight from KC. ?Get some hickory pit beans shipped right to your front door. ?You won't be disappointed.

Let me start by saying I'm from the Southern Midwest and I **know** bar-b-q. Minnies is very close to getting it right. The ribs are disturbingly good by themselves and I tend to like them with only a little bit of sauce. The mac-n-cheese is great, the greens are too salty, the cornbread is never warm (blasphemy), the sweet tea is great but a bit too sweet, the desserts are really wonderful. All in all it's a great experince and the food is mostly good. I do hope they start warming their cornbread up though.

On a recent excursion into the Lower Haight for a friends party I meet up with some other friends going to the same party as they dropped into Memphis Minnie's to pick up some food to take to the party. After looking over the menu they chose the cornbread, potatoe salad, and chicken wings. As we left we saw that they had chili and decided we would pick some up after we left the party. The wing, corn bread, and ?potatoes salad were all very good and seemed to disappear very quickly. After leaving the party we returned to MM for the long desired cup of chili. While the chili was okay it was not what I expected. The lack of bean and high concentration of meat turned me off. While it was not how I would make chili myself it was rather cheap. I give MM 4 out of 5 stars. Taking away one star for my disappointment with the chili. The decor and atmosphere of MM is fun and those who work their are very pleasant

I have been a loyal Memphis Minnite for a few years now, eating there once every couple weeks. ?It has always been my go to "i'm stressed and therefore need pork" joint. ?Over the years they have had a few off days but for the most part , especially lately, they have been great. Now I must say - they have been AMAZING. ?On the most important day of my life they came through with the best BBQ I have ever had. MM's catered my wedding. ?I interviewed loads of "wedding" caterers and realized they were overpriced and would be serving half-assed hotel style food. ?We decided to go BBQ. ?It was going to be a stressful day and I would need pork. It was a risky decision. ?Half my guests were coming from Britain and had no idea what Southern BBQ was, not to mention my now husband is a vegetarian! ?What would he eat? Aside from marrying my husband, MM's was the best wedding related decision I made. ?I can not say enough about John and his crew. ?They even wore starched white chef jackets!!! The BBQ was amazing, pulled pork and brisket with loads of sides that were veggie friendly. ?Perfect. ?I wish I had eaten more but my dress was prohibitive. ?Many of my guests said it is the best wedding food they have ever had. ?People are STILL talking about how good it was. Inexpensive, outstanding, professional. ?God, I wish I had eaten more.

With all due respect to Kansas City and (maybe) Texas, when I think BBQ, I think North Carolina pulled pork BBQ with a side order of hush puppies and cole slaw... in NC, you get a heaping portion of each and it runs you about $3.99. ?The meat is tender and the sauce is delicous... this is why it would be my choice for my last meal on earth. And eating at Memphis Minnie's is just like being back in North Carolina! ?Is what I wish I could say, except that the reality is that this place is crap. ?The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because at least they attempted to serve BBQ, which you don't find a lot of out here. ?The meat was dry, the sauce was off, and it was way overpriced (and yes, I have lived in SF for long enough not to expect a $4 meal, but for what you get here, it's overpriced, even for SF).

There were 2 really good things about this place: 1) the brisket - excellent. meat was tender and delicious. i would make the trip out here just for this. 2) the stoopid hot hot sauce - it's spicy and sweet and oh so good. being korean, it doesn't qualify as "hot" to me, but it sure does have a kick. after you finish eating, all of a sudden you start to feel the burn on your lips. my bf and i shared the 3 meat combo. the sausage, ribs and brisket. it was more than enough to feed the both of us. the sausage was pretty tasteless, nothing special. the ribs i have to say were terrible. they tasted like they had been sitting there all day and then served out to us. we figured, since it was 5pm, it was the last of the lunch meat. not good at all. i actually wished we hadnt ordered those 2 meats and just got an ultra huge helping of the brisket. mac and cheese side was pretty good and potato salad was better than most bbq joints. corn bread was nothing special. just some plain bread would have been better. i didnt care for the vinegar sauce. the mustard sauce was ok. the texas ?sauce was just an inferior version of the stupid hot sauce. 3 item combo plate $18.00 with 2 drinks and an extra cornbread came to a total of $25 (including tax).

Apparently Thursday is the (unadvertised) special for the "chicken fried chicken" sandwich. ?(basically pieces of boneless fried chicken on a roll with some vinegar-based coleslaw). I LOVE a chicken sammy (in any and all forms). This one was pretty good, my only complaint would be that there could be a bit more coleslaw (and no green or red peppers in the slaw). ?I tried the sammy with each of their sauces on alternate bites and found that I liked it without the sauce the best. The chicken was nicely spiced (a teeny bit spicy) crisp, moist and a nice ratio of meat to bun. ?I want to come back on a Tuesday which is apparently the unadvertised special for fried chicken. It comes with a choice of side, I went with mac & cheese, which was fine, but not the style I most prefer. This one was a little gummy rather than creamy (sadly without a crunchy topping). Bottom line, to quote our Govenator---"I'll be back"

I was really excited for some great BBQ. This just wasn't it. I had some sort of pulled pork sandwich. It was so dry and probably about 85 degrees when it was served to me. The onion strings or whatever tasted ok at first but as soon as they cooled down they were just sopping with grease and kind of nauseating. I won't be going back here.

Went to Memphis Minnie's once and ordered a 3-way combo. My friend also ordered a 3-way but somehow my bill ended up $4 less than his. Not sure how that happens but maybe if you order it as a "3-way" instead of as a "taster" you earn a street-cred discount? I don't know. They have Shiner Bock beer here which I like. The brisket -- which so frequently disappoints me at other BBQ joints -- is tender and tasty. Tri-tip and ribs are also above average. A good place. BTW, 3-way plate + beer was around $22 I think.

One of my most favorite BBQ restaurants in the sf area. ?Love the tri-tip, ribs and brisket. Melts in ur mouth like butter. ?For real; it melts. U only need the carolina mustard sauce. ?Not that into the other sauces although i wish they had slightly thicker sauces. ?But they are really just good for their smoked meats. ?As my native born and raised Texan friend tells me, the sauce just gets in the way of the smoked flavor. ? For sides I like the beans and mac and cheese. ?Not too into the corn bread. Location is a little small but decent and it is sf. ? Decor is not kid-friendly. A Plus - u can double up ur meats for the 2-way or 3-way without extra cost. Portions are decent. And price is standard for BBQ. Single bathroom - decently clean.

3 stikes you're out!! ?This was the third and LAST time I'm going to this place. ?The food has been terrible every time. ? St. Louis Ribs: WAY too expensive.. $16 for 4 dried burnt ribs. ?There was hardly any meat on the bones because because it was burnt to a crisp. ?I thought I was eating tree bark. ? Rib tips are also really tough like big chunks of ROCK MEAT or something. ? SIDES: greens were way too vinegary for my taste, mac n cheese was plain and bland, beans had a weird flavor to em, corn bread was dry and crumbly. I don't understand the high reviews for this place, maybe it depends on when you go. ?Last 2 times I went was on a Friday night (last night being one of them). ?It was the exact SAME STAFF both times. ?One of the times I went I tried to call in my order ahead of time, first they put me on hold for 10 minutes, then they said it's going to take 35-40 minutes for my order to be ready, when I get there they make me wait in line which took another 15 minutes and then when I said I was there to pick up my order they started making it and i had to wait another 10 minutes to get the food.

As far as bar-b-que places in this city go, Memphis Minnie's is a pretty good choice.

I'm just gonna do it. I've thought pretty hard about this but this is the closest food to my front door but they get 2 stars. Sorry MM but that's what you get. Say they start at 5 stars for selling tasty BBQ. ? They immediately lose 1 star for service. I'm guessing this starts at the top with the guy with the mustache but otherwise they have a high turnover and usually poor management. ?The service has always been poor for the four years I've frequented this place. Its so cathartic to write about it right now! Another lost star for value proposition. ?It just doesn't add up for what you pay for. ?The two way-combo is enough food for one person but one person shouldn't have to drop $20 for BBQ. ? The sandwiches are pretty good, but leave something to be desired. The 3rd lost star is the experience. Whether its a line that moves slow or an inconsistent product, it always seems to be something. Somehow after more than 20 visits this place manages to underwhelm at a rate of more than 2:1. ?I won't remember this place when I don't live down the street. Two big stars for meat, incredible sauce and a nice take at bbq sides. ?The only trouble is the way these positives interact with the negative. ?It leads to a decidedly two-star experience. ?Its kind of squandered potential over at memphis minnies. ?The worst part is that i'll certainly be going back

Brisket and Pulled Pork are B+ Mac and Cheese is pretty tasty, even though serving sizes are pretty laughable, in general. ? Chose wisely in this establishment. ?Some stuff is overpriced and not that thrilling(Rib Dinner). ?Others are big meals for under $10. ?I think I'll stick with sandwhiches at this joint.

I've been doing Memphis Minnie's for years. There are more "authenticate" smoke shacks in the towns and communities that consider bbq core cuisine. White folk, black folk, yellow folk, brown, there's not a cuisine on this planet that doesn't smoke meat as a cooking option. Memphis Minnie's gets it -- bbq is about the rub and the smoke. They are in the food business like many, have great days, have off days. They have proven, over the course of years, that their ribs, brisket and big bones are rubbed and smoked to perfection. Memphis Minnie's has survived in a neighborhood that once had over six smoke shacks - there's two today. Something's got to be right to survive as a restaurant in this city. If you've not been, check it out. If you've not been in awhile. go again. Try something different. They aren't trying to be anything more than a good place to get a good plate of food.

I can't speak for all the people who claim their meat was "dry." My experience with Memphis Minnie's was full of meat that was crispy and moist in the right spots. The brisket was devine and the pork ribs fell off the bone. The sides are basic and done right. One complaint: the cornbread was a little dry. I've lived all over the South and this competes with any backwoods shack in which I've ever dined. So what, they have sake. No one is forcing you to drink it. Shut up and eat your BBQ. ?

I've eaten at all the places in Memphis TN and many in Texas, and most of them are are better than this. But MM is better than most places in SF, though the newer Baby Blues BBQ is giving them a run for their money. Based on the so-called "meal" I had at Da' Pitt, I can't believe MM is rated just a bit better. ? In both cases, it seems to point to inconsistency, I guess, but I've had a lot of good meals at MM so 4 Stars for this SF BBQ (and their tasty porky greens).

Here's how to enjoy Memphis Minnie's. 1) Eat lunch at MM order what appeals to you. 2) Go drink beer at Toronado. 3) Eat sausage at Rosamunde. 4) Go back to Toronado and have another beer. 5) Stop at Suppenkuche for a boot and potato pancake. 6) Cap it off at Magnolia Brew.

This joint is along my running route. ?After a long evening run, I decided to reward myself with a pulled pork sandwich. The people here are really nice and helpful when deciding which sauce I should use with my pulled pork sandwich. ?Unfortunately, the pork was too dry. ?Pulled pork should be tender and juicy not dry and flaky. ?I ordered the slaw as the side, and the slaw was decent. ?I liked the mix of peppers to add color and kick to a typical vinegar cole slaw. ?Otherwise, the pulled pork was quite disappointing. Next time, I'll just order the pulled pork platter, and hopefully the place will redeem itself.

This place is pretty darn good! Ordered take-out and was happy that I didn't eat there. We went to pick up our food and the place was crowded and loud! But lot's of interesting stuff on the walls, and props to the chipper gentleman who took our order for having to deal with all of us. He even gave us a shot of the sake he had to step away to pour for another table. My boyfriend and I got a two-way combo each: He had the tri-tip and the chicken, collard greens, and cole-slaw. I tried his greens and they were good! Especially considering he had gotten them by accident. He tried to order beans and they heard greens( blame it on the noise level in the joint) I had the sweet smoked pork and brisket, mac n cheese, and beans. The smoked pork was delicious! Not a fan of the brisket and unfortunately it never got eaten, the mac-n-cheese was awesome!!! I think that it had crumbled corn bread in it. yuuummm! and the beans were great as well. Top it off with a corn muffin and I'm good to go! This isn't the kind of place I'd be craving all the time, but I'm sure I'll be back.

hmmm sorry Memphis Minnie's.. Although the service was very friendly, got to say the food was bland and a home BBQ would've been better. Had the pork combo and the catfish. ?I mean I just thought it would have more flavor especially for the price. ? Not sure if we'll come back...if we do, maybe to check out the ribs.

The Brisket is by far my favourite thing here. But that sauce on the wings is also to die for! My boyfriend and I just ordered a few different things, not plates or burgers/sandwiches. All the meat was moist and juicy. The onion strings are addicting. We weren't impressed with the sauces at the table. Just not as flavorful as we had hoped. I had to get a corn bread muffin to wash down the meat... was starting to get the meat sweats. All in all it was good. We'll likely be back.

Can't believe I have never reviewed this place as it is (shamefully) probably my favorite restaurant in town. Having grown up on back yard BBQ, spending most of my teen years and early 20's BBQing river-side with a case of beer, and settling down with a southern boy, I have serious love for this genre of food. ? Problem? ?I now live in a glorified closet with no access to a grill or smoker of my own. Solution? Memphis Minnies. ?Everything is good here. ?EVERYTHING! I've tried their brisket, tri tip, ribs, chicken fried chicken sandwich, pork, and every possible side.... ITS ALL SOOOOOO GOOOOD! Favorites here have to be the brisket, which is always the perfect balance of meat and fat, and the mac n cheese, which is topped with crumbles of corn bread. ?All of their sauces are tasty, and the variety helps tailor the barbecue to your exact craving. Remember to wash it all down with a gallon of nummy sweet tea!

First off...the BBQ is alright and a little ovepriced for what I ordered. I had the beef ribs (3 pieces to be exact) and two side. I was lucky to find parking on a Saturday, because if I had to hunt for a parking spot and what I know now about M.M's; it would not be worth the trouble. Head over to "Sam's BBQ" in San Jose, more beef and more bang for the buck. (hell, they even serve prime rib on Fri. and Sat. nights) For the same price, I got 6 beef ribs and 2 sides...go figure.

Really good barbecue food that comes in large portions. I love barbecue and getting a large food/price portion, so this place meets both of my needs. The barbecue sauces on the table come in 3 different flavors and having lived in each of the three areas, i can attest that they are fairly authentic. Very mouthwatering and definitely a place to return when you need that barbecue fix. ?The 5th star is missing because it doesn't quite have the down home cooking feel and taste perfected, but with 4 stars, you should go.

I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich with macaroni & cheese, corn muffin, and banana pudding for dessert. My boyfriend had the brisket with potato salad and macaroni & cheese. We wanted to order the garlic fries but they were all out. All this food plus 2 sodas came up to about $30+ kind of expensive for cafeteria style eating. Very comfortable place though. I liked the fact that you have rolls of paper towels on each table and that you can get your own tap soda. When I looked around, everyone was eating ribs. I wonder if they're any good. Too bad I don't eat pork or beef. I would go there again to get the pulled chicken sandwich and banana pudding. Hopefully they'll have garlic fries the next time I go there. So you get an idea of what I thought of each item, I rated each item individually down below. Pulled chicken sandwich: 5 macaroni & cheese: 3 corn muffin: taste: 5 ; texture:2 (the corn meal was like raspberry seeds) brisket: 3 (not much taste) potato salad: 4.5 banana pudding: 5

They call this Memphis BBQ?!?! I never been to Memphis, but if this is what it tastes like, I sure don't wanna go!!! If you're into traditionally smoked bbq, then this is not the place for you. First of all, I tried the pork sandwich and thought I'd eat well with some sides cause I sure was hungry! I ordered a side of "tangy coleslaw" and bbq beans. The pork sandwich did not come with ANY bbq sauce on it whatsoever. When I asked for some thick bbq to throw on top my sandwich, they referred me to the watery, cold bbq "sauce" (more like liquid) on my table. The sauce was rather bland and watery. The pork was lacking in flavor. But the bread was decent.... Next I tried the beans. They were hot but unfortunately had ZERO flavor and were watery as well. The coleslaw was the worst. It tasted pickled and had bell peppers in them ??? I guess they're trying to be "different." They also had sake to go with it. WTF? But the worst part is this shady bbq meal cost me $12.50! I'm going to Big Nates, thank you.

While I enjoyed the food, I fell in love with "Memphis Minnie's" because of the experience. Memphis Minnie's is, according to WordPress' terms of service, the official restaurant of Automattic. ?http://en.wordpress.com/¡­ ?Based on their glowing endorsement and tempting photo, I stopped by for lunch on my way to the Golden Gate Bridge, assuming any calories I consumed would be burned off by the walk. With its bright red exterior, it's fairly hard to miss Memphis Minnie's. ?Inside, the tables are festooned with amusing caricatures of pigs eating pork. I ordered the "Southern Star" sandwich sampler (which gave me a half texas brisket and a half sweet pork sandwich) along with mac 'n cheese and a piece of cornbread. ?The sandwich was good but not great, made better by the various barbecue sauces lining the table. ?The macaroni and cheese, on the other hand, was amazing. ?The sauce was thick, and every bite was a juicy, aorta-clogging dream.

After watching KQED's Check Please!, Bay Area, my daughters and i drove to SF iso southern style bbq. I met the owner and he explained to me that the name of his place is a bit misleading: his mother's name was Minnie and she was from Memphis, HOWEVER, the bbq he cooks there is TEXAS style, not Tennessee. I shared with him that i am originally from Mississippi, and that my Aunt Minnie lives in Memphis! (We got a kick out of that!) So to the food: we had the chicken (it was done, but couldve been cooked a tad bit longer), tri-tip (great), mac n cheese (mmm, not the best i'ved had. shouldve been cheesier and thicker), sliced sausage (good), brisket (great), greens (great), beans (okay), cornbread (horrible. dry and gritty!), pecan pie (good), sweet potatoe pie (okay), sweet tea (cool). So, overall, it was good. i'd go back, lots on the menu i havent tried. ?i have to say, being from the South and having been there as recent as '07, this is the closest bbq joint to authentic southern style bbq i've had since coming to CA in '87.

Just goes to show you what happens when the owner no longer works at the joint... (come back Bob! and save your place) Used to be the best BBQ in San Francisco. ?I've been going there for years. As of the last two years, it has been getting progressively worse. But today was the last straw. Dirty floors, dirty bathroom, apathetic staff, the sides were tasteless and the once succulent great meats were dried out (again). And don't talk to the manager, he could care less.

Surprisingly good BBQ for a place outside of Texas. Stella was the only thing on tap, which was less than exciting, but they had Shiner bottles and the food made up for it. The mac 'n cheese was superb, as was the slow cooked brisket, and we got a free plate of chili cheese fries (probably because we had a few Texans in our group). ?Definitely will be hitting this place up again. ?And they take credit card - cha ching.

Our company hired Memphis Minnie's to cater a homebrew event ?so we wouldn't be drinking on empty stomachs. We got there early and were lucky enough to sample everything they had: ribs, brisket, pulled pork, chicken, coleslaw, beans, collard greens, and cornbread! On the side they had three different kinds of sauces. I forgot what they were called specifically, but one was a mustard, another was the Texas Red Sauce, and the last one was a hot version of the red sauce. While in line, we could watch them cook up the chicken and ribs. They hacked into those chicken halves right in front of us! I'm sure these guys are pros, but it kind of scared me to see them be so forceful with a giant butcher knife! The brisket was pretty good. I liked the outer crunch and just cut off the fatty layer. The ribs left something to be desired... I felt like it didn't have much flavor and I ended up dipping it into the Texas Red Sauce (which didn't do much for it, either). I also had a little helping of the pulled pork, which was also just okay. The chicken on the other hand was nice and moist! The juices had the right amount of flavor, no sauce needed! The coleslaw was pretty good, as were the beans, and collard greens... Nothing amazing, though. I did enjoy their cornbread. I got a piece with a dollop of their butter on top. It was crunch on the outside, but not too crumbly inside, which is exactly what I like. It was slightly buttery and sweet, but not overpowering. I'm a big fan of cornbread, and this was definitely up to par! My friend tried some of their sweet tea and seemed pretty satisfied with it, but I didn't try any. As the crowd grew larger (who wouldn't show up for free food and free beer?), the line ended up backing up. I'm pretty sure these guys underestimated the number of employees that would show up. However, I peeked over there before I left and even though they were definitely moving quickly to get things cooking and on peoples' plates, they looked like they had things under control. I've passed by their actual restaurant in SF, but never tried it until now. It's a solid BBQ place that I wouldn't mind returning to for their chicken and cornbread! It seems like they have a lot more to offer on their regular menu, so I'd be curious to give it a shot sometime!

Best slow roast and dry rubbed BBQ in the city, hands down. Some people don't get Minnie's because it's not about BBQ sauce here, even though the sauces at the tables are unique and delicious. Minnie's is about the slow roasted, 18 hour smoked, dry rubbed meats. Brisket and Tri Tip. Tri Tip sandwich with premium sake taster and the sweat and sour slaw they have with pickled ginger!

As a New York native, I don't know nuthin' 'bout Southern barbecue, but I know what tastes good, and this tastes terrific. I usually start with an order of fried cheese grit sticks, then dig into a platter of one of my two favorites, beef brisket or sweet smoked pork (with the big beef ribs running a close second), with tart and tangy cole slaw and a creamy macaroni and cheese on the side. The corn bread fluctuates between moist and crumbly dry, maybe depending upon how soon I get it after it leaves the oven. Only once was I disappointed with a meal, when I deviated from the norm and ordered fried catfish, which was dry, with curly fries that were underspiced and overcooked. Definitely take-out food, because my mother taught me never to lick my fingers in public, and at home I can lick not only them but the plate as well.

I don't think I can add anything to the mediocrity of the food that hasn't been summed up by a multitude of reviewers before myself. What I can say is that Sake does not go with BBQ. I should know. I tried 9 different kinds just to be sure. Oh, and the restroom door is very difficult to operate after trying very hard to understand the aforementioned combo, and you should not have pigs staring at you when you are trying to pee.

Everything is bright and colorful at Memphis Minnie's. Tables on the right and people forming in line for food on the left. Collectibles of pigs adorn the restaurant. The menu is on a chalk board and the choices seem to be endless. I decided on the beef brisket sandie and a corn muffin.

While waiting for him, I pull out my macbook and check my email. Each table has a clear plastic table cloth and underneath are pictures drawn of pigs on napkins- very cool. There is free wireless here at Memphis Minnie's, I believe its called 'Free Web." He joins me at our table and I put my laptop away. Not a moment too soon and his name is called. Our order was up quickly and we were eating. The portions are huge! The beef brisket was cooked perfectly- so juicy melt in your mouth goodness. The corn muffin was oh so good! I had a bite of sausage- OMGoodness that was the BEST. The mac n cheese was okay- slightly on the sweet side (not sure why). The potato salad was exceptionally delish! Beef Brisket -------------------A- Sausage------------------------A + Corn Muffin--------------------A + Mac N Cheese---------------B Potato Salad-----------------A + This place was packed, obviously a local's favorite. The staff was super friendly and helpful. They said hello and good bye to most everyone that came through the door. I noticed a sign above the door was we were leaving it read- "Low Fat = Low Flavor," lol, well written! I was stuffed so I didn't try the sweet potato pie- next time! As we were leaving I noticed everyone seemed pretty happy- family, friends, couples eating and laughing. The food was delish- I was feeling food coma coming on.

Once upon a time, I lived in Texas and consider myself a Texas (beef) barbeque fanatic. ?Well, I can't believe this place has evaded me all these years. ?Its some fine ass rib-nibblin' authentic barbeque, right down to the tattooed, snaggle-toothed employees behind the counter. ?Better than Brother in Law's, and you don't even need to strap on your glock or wear a bullet-proof. ?What's also different about this place is that its really a fusion of Southern and Texas barbeques - two totally distinct styles. ?For example, where else could I have ordered a "two-way combo platter" with smoked beef brisket and cowboy beans perched next to pulled pork and collard greens?! ?I pushed the sides aside and headed straight for the smoked meats which eventually melded all together becoming a plate of tender, succulent diced critter swirling in tangy red sauce. ?YEEEEEHAW! ?(credit cards accepted with ID.) Update: I just tried the beef ribs. ?These are the ONLY real Texas beef ribs I have EVER had outside the State of Texas. ?Bravo!!! And the banana pudding is awesome too. Update: I hope I'm just in a bad dream. ?Last night I went to dinner here and got my usual ribs and brisket. ?This is the second time in a row that the ribs seemed of a slightly lower quality meat than when I first came here a few months ago. ?I hope they haven't switched distributors and I just got the rare bad rib. update: hmmmmm. not sure what's going on here. I suspect that they have changed to a different distributor for their ribs. ?The quality seems to have dropped off a bit. The ribs are coming out tough. ?However, the beef brisket is still top notch, so I will continue to go there. ?Also, try the sweet potatoes in an apple sauce broth.

As a Native Texan, I'm very picky about my BBQ, and it's sometimes difficult to give the proper credit to the Southern style BBQ, but I must say Memphis Minnie's always fills my BBQ craving every single time! ?The sauces are off the charts as well. My friend who turned me onto this place also said their reuben and hamburgers were some of the best in town, but I never can myself to pass on the BBQ. The manager, Ben, was very friendly, accommodating, and extremely knowledgeable, not only about the BBQ, but had an answer for every food question I threw at him like catfish (always get the frozen over the fresh as technique on flash frozen on the boats is legit and "fresh" is usually brought in from the catfish farms in the South).

The 5 - 6 times I've gone to Memphis Minnie's in the past have been fine. ?The last visit, however, was such an unpleasant experience that it cancels out any positive feelings the previous visits inspired. ?After ordering, my friend and I sat down at a table with our sodas to wait for our food. ?After 30 minutes or so (and several people who were behind us in line received their orders), I got back in line to inquire about our order. ?When I asked the cashier if our order had been forgotten accidentally, I was told burgers take a longer time to prepare. ?I am not quite sure why that means at least two parties behind us in line should get their food way before we did.

I'm not a meat eater. Some weeks I can be considered a vegetarian, but on those off weeks, it's because of Memphis Minnie's. The service is a little brisk, you better not take a table before you've ordered (what a genius concept!) or else you'll be called out in front of the entire restaurant. The brisket and tri-tip are my absolute favorite. The mac n cheese, fries and sweet potato pie are all divine. The potato salad eh, not so much. The only creepy thing is that there are hand drawn pigs on paper towels adorning the tables. It is a constant reminder that I'm eating an animal, but I can deal with it for BBQ that literally falls apart in my mouth.

i dont have much positive to say about the food at this place. ?im not an expert on these matters, but i happen to have tasted some of the best bbq in the country at the #1 spot in st. louis. ?so, i really have no choice but to compare all bbq to it. ?i know what good bbq tastes like, and it aint this. ?in ca, this place is probably just below average. ?in st. louis, memphis, or north carolina, people would literally spit out the food in disgust. ?that is how good the bbq is in the midwest and south. ?people would tell me this before i tried it for myself and i didnt believe them, just like you probably dont believe me. ?when i finally did try it, i realized that it is a whole other world. ?if you want the details, they are as follows: beef ribs had big bones but not much meat. ?some of the meat was too charred. ?the rest was fairly tender and had average flavor. pork ribs were tender but almost completely flavorless. mac and cheese seemed undercooked and not very cheesy. beans were decent. ?wasnt very smoky even though they are called "smoked beans" or something like that. seasoned fries were fairly good and the highlight of the meal.

Oh BBQ you are so fantastic. Everything we tried was great. I learned from my years of living in the south that almost anything can be made to taste delicious with a stick of butter. ?This may or may not be the case here but It was great. The sides, the meats all very good to great. The star of the show for me though were the sauces. Oh my the sauces were amazing. simply amazing and i am pretty sure they have no butter in them.

Time to get carniverous! This place is so awesome and I can honestly say it is the best BBQ in the Bay Area. (Hey, my daddy used to drive all the way to Flint's in Oakland from Livermore for ribs TO GO--Kristen was raised on good BBQ). They really do slow cook their stuff because we've walked by it at 2 am and could smell the stuff they were making for the next day. (And it smells even better when you're tanked--the teases!) Their sides are also about as awesome as the meat products. I don't know about the sake with BBQ though. I got a flight and it just didn't jive with me. Now I cannot wait until my cross country road trip through the south so that I can sit in a car and get fat on Southern BBQ--I'm a workout-a-holic; imagine how hard it is for me to want something like that. Sorry vegetarians; you're getting left at home on Minnie's night.

Memphis Minnies is one great BBQ place. I recommend hitting it up on Wednesday's and ordering the pastrami reuben. They cook / smoke / steam the meat for ten days before cutting it up. I added the mac and cheese as a side which was awesome. Dallas "Chef" makes some oft the best BBQ on the west coast.

I am giving them 3 stars for the food (ribs & pie only) because the "customer service" if you want to call it that sucks! Ok, here are the high points (see I am nice, I started with what's good about the place instead of my 1st instict...lol): 1. The ribs (pork) were good - the meat was quality and though I like my meat drippin in sauce, they did taste good. 2. The filling (yeah not the crust) of the sweet potato pie was yummy and the cream really did "top" it off! 3. The cornbread was good. Ok so here are the low points for this joint( and there are many): 1. The guy (Steve) who takes orders on the phone put me on hold 5 times (each about 1min+) and then hung up on me before I could give him my dessert order, the call pretty much went like this: (Me) Hi I want to place an order for pick up (Steve) ok can you please hold? (me) Sure....1-2min pass... (Steve) ok what would you like? (Me) I would like the rack of pork ribs, (Steve) can you hold please for 1min I have to check if we have a rack of pork ribs. (Me) Ok.....1min pass (Steve) Ok, I think I got that for you, what else would you like? (Me) What sides do you have? (Steve) Can you hold for a min please? (Me) Sure! 2min pass.....click, click, click (Steve) ok we have (rattles off the sides)... (Me) Ok, potato salad, greens and 1 cornbread and for dessert.... (Steve) Can you hold one more min please? (Me) Yeah ok! 1min+ goes by. (Steve) Ok what desserts would you like? (Me) Sweet potato pie (2)....hello? (At this point he hung up) ?I call back - (Steve) Thank you for calling MM, this is Steve can I help you? (Me) Yeah I think you just hung up on me! (Steve) What desserts would you like (Me) 2 Sweet Potato Pies! (Steve) ok. Anything else? (Me) Nope! Ok, moving on....to the other low points.. 2. 25min later...I go pick up the food. I get home and those ^&(*$#@ shorted me 8 ribs (and I know this because I called before and asked how many they give you for (or call) a rack) WOW! I mean I pay $46 get 3 sides, a piece of cornbread and 2 desserts and get shorted 8 ribs! 3. The crust for the pies were under cooked. Not good. 4. The I guess you would call it BBQ sauce was not even close to what I would call BBQ sauce. I just could not use it and the honey mustard sauce was ok, but NOTHING special. 5. The Mac & Cheese (which I ordered when I walked in to pick up the food - and oh Steve was so very happy to take my money and no way was so busy I had to be put on hold for all of 8min and hung up on) was mediocre - I could have done WAY better myself. 6. The greens - WAY too sweet - almost rancidy sweet. 7. Potato Salad - bland. Nothing special. All in all I have to sum it up with this: Bad service - edible food for the most part - nothing special but the meat on my ribs which gets my desire to give them a 2 - bump to a 3. I don't plan on going there ever again and can't say I could honestly recommend them to anyone. On the other hand my S/O liked the ribs, agreed with me on the greens, potato salad and mac & cheese but liked the sauce & pie (the whole pie) so I guess to each his own.

Ok, so I'm from Texas, grew up in South Carolina and my dad has actually designed and had made his own BBQ pit so I believe it's safe to say I know good BBQ. ?But this place is a sorry excuse for BBQ. ?I ordered sausage which was way too fatty, the chicken was cooked way too long so it was super dry, the potato salad had huge pieces celery which is all you tasted and Mac and Cheese tasted like it was two days old. Not to mention the corn bread was dry and crumbly. I literally left an entire plate of food; it wasn't worth eating. ?Come on people, this is not good BBQ. ?And to make things worse, my dinner was around $20 which is ridiculous. ?In TX you can get a huge plate for around $8-$10. ?I mean, I know that SF knows good food but they need to go back to square one in the BBQ division.

I've not been here in a couple of months, but took my parents who were visiting from Texas here last night and I'm pleased to report that they're as awesome as ever. ?The brisket was tender and moist, the greens are as tasty as ever, and the mac & cheese has gotten better. ?They still offer cold bottles of Shiner, and the habanero sauce still has a great burn to it. ?Let the whiny Californians bitch about this place all they want. ?If you're from Texas and find yourself in San Francisco wanting some BBQ, this is the place for you. ?It's the closest thing to the real deal you'll find out here.

This place has been hit or miss for me. ?Sometimes it is amazing and other times it has fallen short. ?Their bean sides have been lacking and sometimes the BBQ meat doesn't have enough flavor on its own and has to be drenched in BBQ sauce. ?That said, most of the time I leave feeling full and happy. ?The prices seems a little high.

Best BBQ place I've eaten at in the city! The pork (in all styles and dishes) is awesome- juicy, tender, and tasty. The sides are all amazing and the banana cream pie dessert is to-die-for. This place is a BBQ joint, so don't expect a fancy dining experience or frou-frou dishes on the menu. This is the place to go when you just want some damned good, homestyle BBQ cooking. A little on the pricey side, but totally worth it for the portions and taste.

Horrible service! I called a few minutes ago to order some food for a group buddies and me. Steve, the dude who answered the phone, was a total asshole! His attitude was bad from the get go. He had an attitude just to have an attitude. The first time we called, he rudely answered, telling us to hold for a few minutes, not even giving us an option to speak. We called back a few minutes later hoping someone else would answer...no luck. When I attempted to order for us, he interrupted me and told me he had a line out the door. This would have been my first time ordering from this place....so much for that. I don't care how busy he thinks he is, there is no reason to act the way he did. I will never order from this place.

Not a terribly huge fan, and i LOVES BBQ. Though i do think they have a good thing going being one of the only BBQ joints i can think of, i also think they fall a little short. Im not down with the Carolina/Tennessee BBQ style, which is runny, liquidy, vinigary sauce. I like it like Scandanavian Dancing Girls, thicker than thin and full of fury. ?Sides are aplenty. but a little disappointing. The greens and beans needed enrollment in Herbs and Spices 101. The cornbread is one of their shining stars, as is their sweet potato pie. The actual meat seemed ok, but swamped in all that sauce, it was still dry. This is not a replacement for backyard BBQ, but it seems palatable if youre on your way home from Toronado and you need to get your Q on.

The only thing that I didn't mind eating was the cornbread biscuit. It's somewhat gritty but the pure corn taste is pleasurable. The rest of the meal was rubbish. The beef tasted like cardboard. People always refer to cardboard when something tastes bad, but this is really like cardboard: dry, dull, and tasteless. The collard greens and beans is just as unforgivable. Avoid.

Here's the deal... I used to be a big fan when I ate meat...but now I don't even really know why I was a big fan - I'm not just a sorta fan. I went there and ordered some sides - the food was pretty okay...but the wait was wicked long and the guy was really rude. We asked for cornbread and he got really irritated...told us that it would take 30 minutes for any more cornbread to come out....our order took almost nearly as long to prepare & there was only 2 of us...he could have offered to put them in the oven for us anyway and told us we'd be waiting for a while anyway. The people who got their order right after us DID get cornbread. I know it seems silly to take away stars...but his attitude wasn't really that nice. Also. they have a sign asking for us to nominate them for the Diners and Dives show on the Food Network - but why would i nominated the restaurant when the service wasn't friendly and I felt like I was putting the dude out or something. However...if you like Banana Puddin'...they make the delicious Nilla Waffer kind like you'd make at home. Yum.

Another really good Barbeque place that's on my list now. I had the rib tip plate with mac n cheese and the tart and tangy slaw. The rib tips were full of great smokey flavor and I tried each of the sauces with them. The mac n cvhees was pretty good, but the tart and tangy slaw was different and interesting and really good, very fresh with great flavor. Small place but worth the wait.

With it being the 4th of July and all I was really in the mood for some smokey barbecue. I cruised over to Minnie's and waited about 20 minutes in the line that was out the door. Since the place was so crowded I opted to just take my food to go and enjoy it at home. Since the kitchen is up front I spent my entire time in line drooling over the food that was being made. HUGE racks of ribs were getting smoked up and chopped ?and by the time I got to the register I was dying. I ordered the Southern Star which is a beef brisket AND pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac and cheese and an order of their BBQ seasoned fries. The food only took about 10 minutes to be prepared and was reasonably priced. At first bite I was slightly disappointed by the bread used - more of a baguette texture than anything but too chewy, not crisp enough. The meat however was unbelievably tender and flavorful and the two homemade sauces on the side - texas red bbq and mustard sauce were delish. Mac and cheese was also very good, kind of creamy. The fries are hand cut and are very good but they were unbelievably over seasoned to the point where I couldn't even eat them after a few bites. Overall Minnie's is a cool spot to grab some tasty bbq. I'm not sure I'd recommend running over here if you're visiting SF but it's definitely a great local spot. Update: Just wanted to let you guys know I got a harassing message from a newly created Yelp account about this review. He berated me for complaining about over seasoned fries and crispy bread and to be completely honest seems like it's someone that works or runs Minnie's. Not cool at all, I've never had a negative experience with a fellow Yelper. Very lame.

The BBQ here is the best in the City and some of the best I've had anywhere. The brisket was so tender you almost need a spoon to eat it. The sweet pork was amazing as well along with the sides, particularily the collared greens if you want to try something a little different. The owner is a character and he takes a lot of pride in the quality of the food and the art of good BBQ. They smoke the brisket for 18 hours and have a poor guy who spends the night with an alarm clock to stoke the coals (seriously). Great staff, fun atmosphere, incredible food and cold Shiner Bock!! A+

This is the best ?BBQ place in San Francisco...But that's not really saying too much...It would probably not even hit the top 50 in The Deep South...But...The beef brisket is the best thing there with the smoked pork and smoked turkey breast close behind...The other meats,which include pork ribs,beef ribs,smoked chicken and andouille sausage are nothing that special,but a lot better than Big Nate's...The side dishes are really good with a preference for the potlikker greens and the chili cheese fries...and for desert...there's some decent choices...but....Try The Banana Pudding!

Nothing too fancy about this place. Its straight up BBQ which I may not be qualified to review since I am a vegetarian. I can say that the fried cheese grits sticks with tartar sauce are very indulgent and good. Crispy with cornmeal crust on the outside and moist and creamy on the inside. The macaroni and cheese was also pretty good, even if the sauce was reminiscent of a box of Kraft. My friends seemed to enjoy the ribs, pulled chicken, and collard greens as well. Corn bread muffin was moist but a tad flavorless. Like I said, from a vegetarian standpoint, don't go out of your way but then again this place is all about the BBQ meat.

This is officially our new BBQ spot. We tried the Texas Beef Ribs and pork ribs and it was really good. The meat is tender enough that you can actually eat part of the bone. The beef ribs were on point but I felt that the ribs was just a tad dry. That's being picky because the three sauces they had at the table brought the meat to life. We will be back.

I used to get bucket loads of Memphis Minnie's when we had family style day at my last job. ?I LOVE LOVE the Brisket. ?It is fall off the bone tender and I can never stop eating it. ?The sauces are pretty saucy as well. ?I like the mustard looking one and also the more vinegar influenced sauce. ?The place is small, but there are lots of interesting items to check out when you eat in. ?This is the only BBQ place I've tried so far in SF and I'd go back if again!

as a vegetarian there isn't much for me to comment on as far as the meat at memphis minnies goes. ?i wouldn't have ever thought about going here in the first place if it hadn't been for my friend sean luring me there with the tale of good, real, sweet tea. ?so, i went. ?i had some sides. ?they were good but nothing too memorable. ?i was excited about the fried cheese grits sticks but they weren't that great. ?also, no hush puppies. ?how can you serve bbq with no hushpuppies? ?but maybe they only do bbq that way in eastern north carolina (i'm from wilmington). also, just as a side note. memphis minnies does not serve true eastern nc style bbq. for all those who don't know eastern nc bbq does not use a red bbq sauce. instead just a spicy vinegar is used to dress the slow cooked pork. ?western nc style pork bbq does use a red vinegar based sauce. i almost forgot! the sweet tea was actually really good and on point which shocked me. ?if i was ever in the lower haight on a hot sf day i just might consider going in and getting a sweet tea to go.

Jesus, San Franciscans really don't know what BBQ is. I lived 15 years in Kansas City ?and 6 years in Texas so maybe I have lofty expectations. The ribs were dry liked they were cooked in the oven. My friends brisket looked like it was marinated in ketchup. The place was dirty and the service lousy. This place should be embarressed to call itself a BBQ joint. San Fran - stick to what you know: California cuisine and dungeness crab.

This is the best BBQ in the bay area. We have been there a couple times and the food has been more than worth the wait. Seating is limitied and parking is difficult, the service isn't five star, but really it is a BBQ joint... if you want great service so some place else. If you want great food, this is the place! I love their ribs, briskit, mac and cheese, corn bread, etc. I wish they had a location in the south bay.

I can only assume that the 3 and 4 star reviews for this place are from people who have never had great BBQ. ?San Francisco has a sad lack of authentic BBQ joints, so maybe that's a factor, too. The entire purpose of BBQ, cooking meats at low heat in a smoker for a long time, is to produce an extremely tender and JUICY product. ?The meat served here is very dry and "chewy", to be generous. ?Also, there is a difference between sauce and juice. ?The "sauces" offered here are so thin in both consistency and flavor that they cannot compensate for the bland dry meat. ?This, folks is lame Barbeque. At these prices ($4.75 for a mini-slice of pecan pie? ?Get serious) I expect a lot more quality. ?I urge everyone who thinks this place is good to drive or transit a bit to the east bay and Richmond to experience real BBQ. ?I live close to this place, and am a BBQ lover, so I break down every once in a while and go there. ?It's always just "better than nothing". ? I hope and pray that a competitor that knows what good barbeque is opens in the central SF area so BBQ lovers will know how lame this place is.

Like the fabled elephant graveyard , where all elephants go to die . I have found where all pigs have gone to die. A hog heaven as we say. After watching one too many episodes of Diners , Drive-ins and dives , I had a mad craving for BBQ. Luckily I had a cohort who felt the same. We skipped down the haight , following our noses to the smell of sweet BBQ. I really like the sweet potatoes and the assortment of BBQ sauces on our table. The pulled pork sandwich was awwwright. I loved the cheesy ambiance with the crazy assortment of pigs everywhere you turn.

Caveat: I have a fear of ketchup and I love BBQ sauce. I HATE when places put the word "ketchup" in their ingredient for BBQ sauce. I thought this place was extremely overhyped and overpriced. Wasn't disgusting, but c'mon San Francisco, you can do better! And, change the ingredients.

Ever since i moved to the Bay Area from Texas about a year ago i have been on a steady search for a decent BBQ place for when im feeling homesick. The first place i tried, Uncle Frank's in Mountain View, remains my favorite, but this place is definitely seconds (haven't tried Bo's yet). My GF and i were planning on going to Bo's last friday night but she got home late and there was no way we were going to make the hour long drive and get there before they closed. With my heart set on having BBQ i remembered reading about Memphis Minnie's and looked them up. They're open till 10, so we hopped in the car and headed up to the City. The place was much smaller than i was expecting. Its also pretty kitschy. It doesn't feel like the best texas BBQ joints which are usually out in the middle of nowhere and involve a large woman who calls everyone 'baby', large slabs of meat served on butcher paper (no plates), and a roll of paper towels at ever table. This place feels like it would fit in pretty well in Austin though. And the t-shirts and other memorabilia from some of my favorite BBQ joints back home indicate that they know their history. So how was the food? We started with the rib appetizer. The ribs were okay, but certainly not the best i've had. They were a little dry (i like wet ribs) and weren't quite fall-off-the-bone tender. Luckily they have 3 sauces to help the dry ribs problem. Ah yes, the three sauces. They do a vinegar based Carolina sauce that was good, but i can't really compare it because i haven't had authentic Carolina vinegar sauce. Next up is the mustard based Carolina sauce that was definitely the star of this trio. Not quite authentic but delicious in its own way. Last up with the tomato based Texas sauce. It was good but a little bit off. Texas sauce is traditionally sweetened with brown sugar (or sometimes honey), not white sugar. While there was brown sugar in the ingredients listed on the bottle, it was definitely sweetened with mostly white sugar. Also, Texas sauce traditionally has much more heat than this. Throw in some crushed red pepper and you might be on to something. See Uncle Franks for a great tomato based sauce with some heat. Next up we got the pork sandwich with BBQ seasoned fries. The pork was okay but also dry. I loaded it up with the mustard based sauce and it turned out okay, but i feel like i make better BBQ pork sandwiches at home. The fries were pretty incredible though. Last up was the brisket. With mac and cheese (the GF has a thing for mac and cheese), collard greens, and a corn muffin. Holy crap, the brisket was incredible and after everything else being pretty mediocre caught me completely by surprise. Next time i come here im only getting brisket. It really needs no sauce but a touch of the Texas sauce sets things off just right. I'm pretty unusual in that i am a Texan who loves pork BBQ (thats a Tennessee, Georgia, Kansas, Carolina thing), but i agree with most that brisket is really the way to test a bbq place. It starts out as a tough, fatty, truly disgusting cut of meat, and anyone that can turn it into something delicious knows what they're doing. This was good brisket. The mac and cheese was good but not great. The collard greens were fantastic though. I didn't know anyone was cooking collard greens in the Bay Area. Wes was right though that the sides are ridiculously small. The cornbread muffin was also a bit dry and not sweet enough for my taste. Speaking of bread, i know that if there is one place in this glorious country where wheat bread is giving white bread a thrashing, its right here in the Bay Area. You guys (and myself included) love that super dense 9 grain stuff that could kill someone if dropped on their head. I continue to be amazed and you guys' inability to eat white bread with BBQ. Look, i don't think i've had a sandwich on wonder bread since i was in 3rd grade. I love my wheat bread. When it comes to sandwiches for lunch, or toast for breakfast i turn end to a grouch if i get stuck with white bread. But somehow with BBQ it just works. Nothing soaks up that sauce and washing things down like a slice of wonder bread. Why is that so hard? Im not asking you to eat wonderbread all the time, just with BBQ. You can't get cancer from eating like 3 or 4 times a year. Plus you're eating BBQ, are you really going to try and monitor what you're putting into your body? Wheat bread or french baguettes just don't have the right texture. Its got to be white bread. I'm not really sure whats up with the sake and would advise people to stay away. I see how maybe the flavor contrast would work but it just feels wrong. Instead go for the sweet tea, a southern staple. Its not the best sweet tea, but its not bad for being served out here. They make good sauces at Minnie's, but they should get over their fear of putting them on the meat. I'll be coming back, but at the moment Uncle Franks is still the king of Bay Area BBQ

OMG- We went here right after the Haight street fair. We just happened to come across and we thought why not. It looked good and truth be told at the moment BBQ did sound good. So we came in and food there to be a line, we knew we found something good if that many people were waiting. Little did we know. The guy who was taking the orders was very rude. I felt like i was on his time and not like a new customer. We ordered and my friends chicken meal was raw. Seriously the chicken bone on both pieces of meat (leg & thigh) had blood still on it. The chicken wasn't cooked all the way. The corn muffin was dry. Overall it was bad. I will never come and eat at this place again.

This place is fucking amazing. Its probably not the most traditional BBQ joint (like Brothers in Law) but it is so addictive I can't give it enough stars. The brisket is what is most popular here and rightly so. My recommendation for an introduction to this place is to have their brunch, served on the weekends from 10-2. If you have their brisket hash with poached eggs and do not immediately have an orgasm then you must be impotent.

The T.G.I. Friday's of BBQ. There are t-shirts from real, legitimate BBQ cook-offs hanging all over the walls and they have brightly colored displays explaining things like "Grilling VS BBQ", "Kansas City Style VS Texas Style", etc. A seeming accumulation of cute little introductions from all the stupid BBQ-101 books that you scoffed at last time you had to be inside a Barnes & Noble or the like. If Minnie's turned out phenomenal, competition-quality 'cue, the whole decor would still be a bit Red Robin. But given the mediocre meat served there, the decor is reminiscent of a white college kid with nasty dreadlocks who wont stop explaining (in harvard ebonics) the differences between rap and hip hop. You're standing there thinking, "rap and hip hop are great and all, but I'm sure that whatever kind of music is in this douchebag's ipod is crap custard". Same story at this BBQ joint, I'm sorry to report. For all their authentic posturing and detailed explanations of the art, they don't deliver the goods. The pulled-pork sandwich is served on a hard french roll. Without coleslaw. The ribs are BOILED before smoking. Boo.

Memphis Minnie's may not world class bar-b-que, but the BEST in san francisco. A good selection and really edible bar-b-que, unlike the more famous place down by the central freeway. Ribs are good and you can get pulled pork. Great viniger sauce. Meals and meat by the pound for takeout

I haven't eaten here since 1996, but I am damn glad to see it alive and well. This is the best BBQ joint on the entire West Coast. Trust me, I should know, I've eaten at them all.

Love the cornbread, love the coleslaw, love the nana puddin. Oh ya... the meat has been pretty tasty too! Slow cooked, smokey flavor.

I'd been told that I needed to visit this place many times over the years and this past Friday night I finally did. Since the art walk was happening they had a grill set up outside for tri-tip sandwiches. They also had their ribs sitting on the side staying warm. I tried both and fell in love. The rub on the ribs is excellent and the bones are soft so you know they took their time. They have a choice of sauces for the sandwich and Ms. B got the Carolina style which is full of vinegar. Just like home. Can't wait to go back and try everything. I really look forward to the sides.

In a city that is lacking in the BBQ department, Memphis Minnie's is a nice treat!

The restaurant itself was just plain old "OK." I wouldn't quite rate it 3 stars.... but perhaps in the range of 2.50 to 2.75. It's just your regular bbq shack with different "stupid" hot sauces on the table. It's a little on the pricey side for that kind of food. The cashier was pretty friendly and nice and I also liked the fact that they served sweet tea there (even though I can just brew some up myself at home). The sweet tea has this nostalgic taste that brings me back home to Mississippi so I like to drink it every once in a while. Also, there's lots of cool piggie decor to look at while you're smacking away and licking your fingers. ?So feel free to add your personal touch of piggie artwork to the restaurant's collection. Oh and I thought it was weird that this "soul food" joint served Sake too. Now, on to the food -- I got the fried catfish, tartar sauce, corn muffin and bbq seasoned fries. It also comes with coleslaw, which didn't quite appeal to me so I didn't end up touching it. I thought the corn muffin was a little on the dry side with a butter after taste that I'm not used to. I prefer my cornbread to have the right slight crunch on the outside, moist inside and a little sweet and I add the butter myself. The bbq seasoned fries were tasty, but I kept burping up that taste so that wasn't too good. Haha. The catfish was just okay.. I wouldn't get it again like I normally would at other Southern restaurants. The breading tasted like there were some sort of sand crystals in there. I don't know how else to describe it. Like there's speckles of something super hard in the batter and I can hear noises from my teeth grinding into it. Does anybody know what the heck I am talking about?! My other two buddies got some pork ribs, beef brisket & mac cheese. I think if I ever came back to this spot, I would give them ribs a try. They looked pretty moist and you can add those tangy/spicy sauces on it. That's all folks!

I dunno what it is but every time I come in here I try my hardest to eat something delicious and it just doesn't happen. It's like a sick joke or something.

I've been here several times and i WISH that I felt the happiness that the people i come with feel. I have tried several times to like their sauce selection and it just seems...not like the flavors i want to put onto my meat. I want a hardy BBQ sauce or a spicy tang to kick it up a notch. Doesn't happen. I dont know why. I like the place a lot, and I could see how people may be turned off by the owners, but come on its a BBQ joint, they need some kinda attitude. I really like their fried onion strings though, they can be quite delicious.

To start off I have been eating BBQ and soul food for years. My family is from all over the south so I know good BBQ. My friend and I shared the combo dinner with ribs, steak, sausage, mac and cheese and cole slaw. We we're both shocked and disappointed. First off, what is with the price for the portion that you get at this spot?! I was very sad to see that after paying about $20 for a plate of BBQ to find when ?my friend and I sat down to grub we only got a cup of each one of the sides and a small portion of each type of meat we ordered.

Do yourself a favor and get the tri-tip plate. The meat is tender, the crust is crunchy, and the sides are excellent. They had Japanese Sake too, which struck me as off pudding. I guess Sake and BBQ go good together? Skip the Sake and get more corn muffins.

I love barbeque and usually end up spending a small fortune but I was highly impressed with the prices at Memphis Minnie's. It's by no means a fancy place - you are going for BBQ after all! The staff is super friendly, fast and attentive and even stopped by to ask how I was enjoying my food. That's more than I generally expect from a place where you place your order and pay before sitting down. I tried the Beef Brisket based on the recommendations of other yelpers and was very happy with it. I didn't think I could eat a full dinner size plate, and the cashier recommended that I order the lunch sized portion which was perfect! The Mac & Cheese is wonderful, very light and fluffy but not too rich. The cornbread muffin was a little on the dry size. ?I'm also a big fan of their BBQ sauce (sweet with a little kick) and their southern mustard.

I like me some BBQ! ?If you love BBQ, then try this place. ?I'll admit, it's not the BEST BBQ spot I've been to, but it's darn near close. ?The ribs were tender and the BBQ sauces were yummy. ?If you aren't aware, the parking situation is horrible at the Haight area, so you better have some Wheat Thins in the car to munch on while you drive around for about 1 hour to look for parking. ?Check this place out everyone, it's a treat!

i don't know what took me so long, but i'd never tried memphis minnie's until last night, and now i'm planning to work my way... slowly.... through the menu. i had the rib tips, which were tasty enough, with a bit of gristle. the three sauces on the table were good. well, at least the red texas sauce was great, and the most expected for bbq. i loved the vinegar north carolina sauce, too... and mixing those together was just about perfect. i didn't try the mustard sauce, i'm going to save that for my next visit, when i'll try the sausage. for sides, i had the potato salad, which was just like my mom's southern potato salad, and the potlikker greens, which were awesome!! slightly sweet and vinegary. yum. i told my tennesse dad about them and he was jealous. the cornbread was fine. and for dessert, banana pudding. like my grandma used to make, only they use little nilla wafers instead of the big ones. yum yum and yum again. it's not cheap, but it's good, no-nonsense, neighborhood food. i'll be back for sure, for sure.

I didn't earn the nickname BBQ Ben for nothing so you know I love me some BBQ. ?After a pretty long hiatus from BBQing because of school and a lack of space for a grill at my apartment, I got a really really bad craving for some 'que. ?After some research I decided to try out this place and I really wanted to like the food here because the ambiance is cool, but I honestly think the food was lacking. ?I had the pork ribs which were not really falling off the bone and on the dry side with the beef brisket which was really full of fat but pretty tender. ?For the sides I had the mac n cheese which was barely even lukewarm and seasoned fries which was a bit too sweet but was the best part of the meal. ?The cornbread I had was not even warm, come to think of it nothing in my meal was served warm which disappointed me. ?Like I said I wanted to like this place but I just couldn't.

Minnie's is a great place if you are craving slow-smoked, southern BBQ with vinegar-based sauces. Their brisket is the tastiest in town; be sure to get the platter so you can pick 3 of their great side dishes. I recommend the beans, corn bread, and mac n' cheese. For dessert, their pecan pie and banana pudding are as good as any place in town.

I really wanted to like this place. ?My friend was raving about the BBQ here and I liked the atmosphere... it really made you feel like you were going to a southern homemade hole-in-the-wall restaurant that gave it a sense of authenticity. ?Maybe it was just a bad day, but I wasn't really feeling it that night I had it. ?The place is pretty poppin as soon as you step foot in the door, I was introduced to someone's back as there was a long line to the cashier. ?And the place wasn't very large, so the amount of people that can be seated was pretty minimal. ?One thing I did like about the place was how the guy behind the counter will basically yell out to get your queue to a table, and the customers there were pretty nice about following the rules. I ordered the Texas Beef Brisket with side order of mac n cheese and potato salad. ?The sides were very average... I think I've made better mac n cheese and their potato salad, while better than the mac n cheese, was very typical. ?The brisket was pretty good, though very dry eating it straight up. ?They had these bottles of various BBQ sauces that you can add to the meat, and I think that's the only way to eat the meat here. ?I drenched that sucker with the Texas Red Sauce and it made it infinitely better. ?It wasn't very spicy, but it did good. ?I was able to finish off most of everything on the plate, but I don't know why this place didn't leave a better taste in my mouth. ?Perhaps I had really high expectations here due to what I had heard, but I had a hard time deciding whether it deserved at least 3 stars. ?After contemplation, I couldn't give it more, but I am willing to try the place again if I ever get a chance to, so I can open my eyes and tastebuds to what people are talking about.

I went with high expectations, but left feeling a little disappointed. ?I tried the beef brisket. ?It was perfectly tender, but lacked flavor. ?The sauces on the side just didn't give the umph.

I went for the St Louis Ribs - no sides. It was good BBQ. Sauces were weaker than I expected, especially when one of the sauces had a scull and cross bones on it but was not even hot as Tabasco. ?Bring on the heat please! ?Liked the people and comfortable to sit there on my own and eat some ribs. ?Will return again but with my own sauce.

We go here before Niners games to stock up but only if Brother in Laws isn't open. The selection of sauces, three of them in total, is really cool. Everytime I have the brisket I think about my Hindu friends and how much they really all missing out. Everytime I bite into the pork ribs I wonder how silly Islam really is. Where I think this place falls short is in spicyness (I like it HOT!) and the sides. I'm not down for cornbread...I need a buscuit or some bunny bread. Check this place out, it might match better with your palate than it did mine. In the meantime...if Brothers is open, that's where I go.

This is an awesome Tennessee-style BBQ joint. Pros: I always get the St. Louis pork ribs and they are always very tender and full of smokey flavor. The homemade sauces are all great (Note: None of them are typical BBQ sauces Californians are used to. They are purely Tennessee style with lots of vinegar and mustard). Service is pretty friendly. Most of the sides are pretty good, the mac n cheese is the best. Cons: Parking is HELL near Haight Street!!! This is really the main reason why I don't go more often then once every few months. My boyfriend loves eating the food, but he always pays for it later with major stomach problems. I don't seem to have problems but he is not the only one I know who has had these complaints. Not all the sides are good, example the sweet potatoes are usually undercooked.

When we went the line was out the door and service is counter style ordering. If you can snag a seat you are lucky as it is pretty much standing room for all who order and a thin line of tables along one side of this narrow restaurant. ?The food is good for the money and there were a variety of BBQ sauces and condiments. The deep friend peach and pecan pie are pretty decent. The beef brisket is good but a little dry. ?The ribs are not impressive to me. My fries were very well seasoned but a little limp. A ?place for BBQ but not for service or atmosphere. Definitely a good ?choice for take-out in the future.

If you like brisket, then come here quickly to sample theirs because its frickin great, I don't know a place in the Bay thats as good and I've eaten at nearly every 'que place around. I wanted to not like this place when they took over my old fav breakfast spot Spagetti Western, but the decor aside, its all about the meat and this place does it right. Although I can't recommend ribs since I never get that. I usually get the southern star brisket sandwich combo because I like the pork too. The sauces are great, the owner is cool, nice to talk to about bar b que in general and its located across from Toronado, the best beer bar in the U.S., and you can't always eat the great dogs next door...

I was so disappointed with MM that I started a Yelp account to warn others. I'd read so many good things about MM here on Yelp that I was excited to go. The atmosphere was cool, and the people very friendly. The quality of food, however, was really poor. It's been mentioned that the brisket was like beef jerkey, and I couldn't agree more. Slow cooked shouldn't be "dried out and shriveled." Coupled with the tiny side portions the presentantion reminded me of a prison movie. I was quite honestly insulted that anyone with a conscious could have put this stuff in a container for someone to eat... and for what they charged, it was pretty much ridiculous. Granted, this was during a week day and the food might be better at dinner or weekends but I am more than reluctant to give this restaurant another try. It should go without saying that the quality should be the same (hopefully great) whenever that 'open' sign is on the door.

I'm from the South, Atlantic coast, and I'm particular about my bbq. A good tender pulled pork is the highest form of bbq in my opinion, and a good beef brisket is not far behind. I had given up on finding any worth even eating in the bay area, but decided to give this one a try anyways, and was shocked. ?The place is tiny, the decor is too reminiscent of Po Folks, but they do a damn fine job with pulled pork and beef brisket. and they even have a SC mustard sauce! its actually better than most bbq places I've eaten at in the South. so in CA, thats worth 5 stars.

I have been going to Memphis Minnies for years and the cole slaw has vastly improved! ?Love it now, but it will not make up for a somewhat recent change in containers used for sauce when ordering take-out. ?The plastic sauce containers are about half the content of what was once provided. ?I no longer live in the Haight (or San Francisco for that matter) so that meant there was no chance of driving back a few days ago. ?This reflects cheap business practices (in my opinion) as I had to carefully delegate and dabble sauce on my meal and go without the desired amount since the current little tiny sauce cups just don't make it. ?Now I must be preoccupied with asking for two sauces when I go in.....come on now! ?Once four stars now three........

I'm a regular here, which in light of my following review, either makes me very patient or just a glutton for punishment. ?(I'll explain that part at the end.) ?In sum: dining at Memphis Minnies is a very inconsistent, very uneven experience. ?More often than not, it's just not very good. At its best, this place deserves all the superlatives you'll see in the other reviews. ?Seriously. ?Its brisket, when the brisket has just been roasted, is succulent and wonderful. ?The fatty exterior of the cut is charred just right, sealing in the juices. ?Similarly, when the sweet-pulled pork is just ready, it's a moist mound of fine barbecue. ?The ribs--I'm less a fan of the ribs here, and have fewer good things to say about these-- but that said, when they're done right, others seem to like them. The problem is that they're rarely done just right. ?You never do get the barbecue here at the peak of perfection. ?That legendary brisket--purportedly slow roasted for 18 hours--is, at the time you're ordering, roasted for a whole lot longer than that. ?And by the time you get it, it's usually quite dry. ?I won't exaggerate and say that it has the consistency of beef jerkey, but it sure looks like beef jerkey--and that is *not* an exaggeration. ?And dry brisket, by the way, is not very appetizing (and annoyingly flaky). ? And the same goes for their pork, and their ribs, and their tri-tip. ? And forget about trying to get a truthful heads-up from the college-aged help behind the counter. ?Ask them how their barbecue is that day, and they've got an answer that'll make Ol' Memphis Minnie herself proud: "it's great." ?The help is, well, no help at all. Anyway, I'm a regular at this restaurant because I live around the corner from the place. ?This is, for me, one of few neighborhood joints that I go to when I don't feel like cooking, which is often. ?So, I've been to this place many, many times (easily more than 20x, probably less than 50x), and I have a strong basis for my opinion. ?So take my word for whatever you think it's worth. The Bay Area's got a decent amount of barbecue places (mostly in Oakland, but one or two in the city as well), many of which are quite good and very consistent. ?If you're looking for good barbecue, go elsewhere. (One thing: If you must go, and I know it's not cool to do this, but I really do recommend asking to see the cut of meat that you're ordering. ?You can tell right away if something's been in the smoker too long. ?Also, if the guys behind the counter pull out your ribs and they're wrapped in aluminum foil--which I've seen more often than I can count--just cancel your order and run to Rosamunde's across the street.) Rosamunde's is good all the time.

Been here a few times. Disclaimer: I grew up in Kansas City and am a bit of a BBQ snob. This place actually smokes the meat-not crazy about any of their sauces, but I wouldn't want to spoil the meat anyway. I've the the tri tip, pork and beef and all were very good. Cool place to grab a sandwich or a huge meal and hang out with some friends. Community seating usually provides some interesting conversation. Love the deserts but the sides were not overly impressive. Parking is a bitch, but the 22 is close by.

After having a disastrous BBQ experience in Milpitas I was hurting to ?have some good BBQ. Luckily we were going to San Francisco. I had remembered watching "check please" and seeing this place. It looked so good on the show that I have been wanting to try it for months now. I was not disappointed. The place is nice enough inside. Not seedy at all. I had to get it to go since I had just eaten a few hours earlier. We tried the beef and pork ribs as well as the brisket. All were solid. I personally liked the regular BBQ versus the mustard but it was nice to have a couple choices. I really want to go back and try some of the other side dishes like the mac and cheese and fried grits. The banana pudding looked good too! Next time for sure. Good job Memphis Minnies for restoring my faith in BBQ. now if I could just quit burping up liquid smoke.

My standard order includes the brisket sandwich with a side of collard greens, rib tips, and a slice of pecan pie. ?The brisket has a crunchy bark with just the right amount of spice while the meat has a medium smoky flavor that does not need any sauce. ?The collard greens are salty good, and the pecan pie has enough sugar to induce a diabetic coma.

You absolutely cannot find better BBQ in the city! That's it - you just can't. WHY did it take me so long to go here? Oh yeah - all the pigs were a little intimidating for a semi-kosher Jew like me!

But what's with the Sake menu? Huh? Am I missing something? When did BBQ pair with Sake? Seriously - their Sake list rivals Skipjacks. Who cares. I SMOTHERED my brisket sandwich and fries with their house made BBQ sauce and mustard. EVERYTHING is made in house from scratch. As it should be! I swear, I damn near drank the stuff. Just go.

I lived right by Memphis Minnie's and had the chance to try a few of their options. ?I ordered the Texas brisket meal one time (supposedly smoked for 18 hours). ?They offer 3 different sauces (a Texas one, a NC mustard one, and a NC vinegar one). ?Corn muffin tends to be dry (a la has been sitting out for a while). ?The brisket was quite nice but overpriced. ?The sides (beans and mac & cheese) were very small in portion and not memorable. ?I never got around to trying their ribs because they're on the pricier side. ?My best advice: try a sandwich, half the price of a meal, and you still get a nice portion.

lunch for two: ?$34 this is more of a carolina style bbq....hence, everything here is based with vinegar...the beans tasted like vinegar, the greens tasted like vinegar...every sauce was vinegar-based...everything just fell short of our tastebuds-o-meter the greatest disappointment were the ribs...they don't use the high-quality baby backs...they use short/spare ribs...i've NEVER seen this done at a bbq joint before...i don't usually use sauce because the meat should be flavorful and smoky alone....these ribs were very bland and a touch dry...almost zero taste of the smoky flavor you crave from a bbq joint sorry, but we won't be back...boo!

I really wanted to like this place. ?The divey atmosphere, the grande texan workers flipping the meat, the excessive pig paraphernalia apparently wasn't enough to sway my opinion of the food. ?We had the meat sampler w/ ribs, brisket, and sausage w/ mac n cheese and cornbread. ?I didn't like any of the meats. ?The sides were ok. ?I won't be coming back. ?SF seriously is in dire need of decent bbq places.

I could make this reeelly funnneee but then the review would be seen as pure comedy. So on with the serious review. This place did not suit my taste. I had the pulled pork and beef brisket combo. they both had the standard smoked flavor that you could find at nates,everett jones or carmens. Nothing special really. It was dry too. I was expecting something exciting and special that i could proudly gush with oohs and ahhhs but alas it was nothing to even write about with exception of this review....oh, i almost forgot...the coleslaw was good!!!

This place is O.K. I am totally from S.F. and so I'm just not into all that vinaegar in my sauces. Sides are pretty good but I never crave them. The meat is great sometimes and sometimes too dry. For the price I prefer more consistancy. Staff was nice but who cares if the food isn't what I want. I can see someone else digging on this place but I just don't think it is for me. That's all.

Memphis Minnie's was featured on "Check Please" on KQED. ?Three everyday, off the street type of people who apply to be on the program are invited to share their view about their favorite restaurant. ?Each of the other two also patronize the restaurant and give their critiques. ?The program is quite informative as the restaurants range from greasy spoons to some pretty upscale places. ?Another feature of the show I like is they tell you what to expect to spend per person without drinks. ? Memphis Minnie's received rave reviews so I was disappointed when the food didn't blow me away. ?I ordered the St. Louis rib plate which included a sweet corn bread muffin and two sides. ?I chose the potlicker greens and the southern sweet potatoes. ?The greens were good and the sweet potatoes were ok. ?The skimpiness of the portions bothered me somewhat. ?The sides amounted to about two tablespoons worth and there were about 4 or 5 ribs on the plate without the tips. ?The tips are offered as a separate cut. ?The ribs were fairly tasty but a little too dry for my taste. ?The meat would just about fall off the bone before you could get it into your mouth. ?Minnie's does make excellent sauces which are abundantly available on each table. ?My wife had the tri-tip sandwhich. ?Interestingly enough, the only thing on her plate was a tri-tip sandwhich, no fries, no cole slaw, nothing. ?You would think at $8.95 they would at least put some fries and an ice cream scoop of slaw on the plate. Ever since this place was featured on "Check Please" the place has been jammed. ?One of the people in our group said he's never seen it like that. ?There is only seating for about 20 people total so if you have a group as large as 6, it is a challenge to get seated together. I honestly don't think I would go again considering the fact that Armadillo Willy's does a better job on it's meats and is a much better value.

If they had good sauce, a definite 5 stars, but today i couldn't figure out which sauce i hated the least. Luckily for them, their meats are just as good without sauce. Also, their staff is wonderful. Everyone is always so friendly. I should start going here more often.

I saw the review of this restaurant on Check Please Bay Area and tried it due to the favorable review of all three panelists. ?Like any good restaurant reviewers, we tried an assortment of entrees and side dishes and were disappointed with everything. ?The only dish that was marginally acceptable was the brisket. ?The portions were small, the ribs were overcooked and the flavor was bland unless you added more sauce to the meat. ?All the side dishes were bad especially the the corn bread which was very rough and contained hard pieces of corn. I would go to Big Nate's or Everett and Jones for good bbq.

Either there are two Memphis Minnie's or the place has some some serious consistency problems. The meat is traditionally barbecued: cooked over wood or charcoal "long and slow," but that's about it. ?I've tried the place a few times and have always found their meat overcooked to the point of mushiness. ?I agree that it's probably perfect for a two-year old, but I prefer more consistency to my meat than Gerber's. Additionally, I have not had a good side dish there yet. ?The macaroni and cheese is mediocre, the "southern" sweet potatoes laughably bad, and the cole slaw only acceptable. Oh, yes, Memphis Minnie's does offer a small variety of barbecue sauces. ?I believe a trio: Memphis, Texas, and Mustard. ?None of them are great. ?For really good barbecue, I suggest barbecue fans travel farther south in the state to Central Texan Barbecue in Castroville or Pecos Bill's in Glendale. ?Those two bring true meaning to the word barbecue.

Minnie's is still the barbecue king of San Francisco, though its place at the top is slipping (see my last paragraph). ?I just reviewed B's and wrote plenty about the good and bad points about Minnie's, so I'll make this a little quicker. I saw Bob Kantor's name on the guest signbook at Snow's in Lexington, TX the very same day I went--it's too bad I didn't get the chance to shake his hand. ? The brisket at Minnie's is the best in San Francisco. ?The meat and the dry rub are excellent. ?It's as good as a commercial smoker can produce. ?Sometimes the brisket can be a hair dry, but it's usually fantastic: flavorful and moist. The sausage at Minnie's is also the best in San Francisco. ?I can't stand links, and the andouille is actually reasonably similar to the sausage cooked in Texas. ?No complaints: it's the best around. The ribs are also good, though I prefer B's. ?B's have the perfect rub and the meat just tastes better. ?Minnie's ribs can be a little dry. ?Baby Blues also has good ribs, but B's wins in this category. ? The sides at Minnie's are excellent--the mac & cheese, fries, and cornbread are all very good. ?Big win for Minnie's. ?The sauce is also very good, especially the yellow mustard stuff. ?Very distinctive and goes well with the meats and sides. Now to the major downside at Minnie's: the intangibles. ?More specifically, it's very difficult to get a meal there. ?They have no takeout register--which means that if you call in in advance, you still might stand in an absurdly long line to get your food, which is just unacceptable. ?It's even more unacceptable considering there's no parking at all in the Lower Haight, which inevitably means you have to park illegally to pick up your food (and then risk geting towed for a half hour while you wait in line). ?There's no delivery option either, so these problems can be especially troublesome. ?The cashiers can also be annoyingly dismissive, the space is pretty cramped and the service just stinks. ?A word to the wise at Minnie's: the difference between you and the #2 in the city (the just-opened B's) is now very small. ?This is when service becomes a higher priority. ?Yesterday I had a decision to make between Minnie's and B's and I chose B's because the food is excellent, it's easier to park/pick up and the owner cares about his customers.

This place stays true to the spirit of "real" bbq. Real BBQ--it's cooked ("smoked") for a long ass time over a fire usually with oak, mesquite or some other substance that adds its own rich flavor to the meat. What most of us (on the West Coast at least) consider BBQ at home is in fact called grilling which is a different concept (unless you are getting into Santa Maria style than that's a whole other deal). So yeah I take my BBQ seriously.... I hadn't been to this place in forever but after feeling a certain grumbling in my gut followed by a sign (ok I was thumbing through Details and I saw huge pornographic pics of meat--the dead coming from animal kind, not the other kind of meat that Details would be prone to show) I realized I had to go out my quest. After a nice stroll I found myself here with partner in crime John H. I remembered the brisket being quite good and that it was! Rich smoky flavor in every soft yummy bite and I was fortunate enough to have gotten it at just the right level of dryness sans sauce. The Memphis style pork that John H got was equally good in terms of richness but not as lean as my brisket (but pork fat tastes so fricken good! Hey I'm a Yelper, it's kind of assumed if you eat meat and you Yelp, you eat bacon. Think about it.) The mac and cheese was surprisingly just as hefty on my belly as my sandwich. If I had had ANY room in my pooch left I would have filled it with their banana pudding concoction. ? Key notes though: This is tough to eat after a night of hard drinking. After all the food is consumed, for the rest of the day, when you burp you will be tasting your meal here. Rich meaty smoky burps=not cool. They only have two beers on draft here: Anchor Steam and Sierra Nevada. And that's just fine by me

I may or may not be giving Memphis Minnie's a four star review merely for their absolutely delicious sweet tea. ?Their Pastrami Wednesday pastrami sandwiches may also be contributing to their four stars. ?The mac and cheese is probably also related. ?The brisket is probably not part of it - I found it a little dry. ?The ribs are definitely a piece of the puzzle. ?And the really remarkably nice people that work there are certainly helping to round it out.

They get 4 Stars on the yellow BBQ sauce alone, not to mention the banana pudding. I've recently noticed that the meat is a tad inconsistent- one day the brisket is dry and lean, the next day it's fatty and juicy and same with the pork. I love the ribs, and the bread that they use for their sando's is really good, hollowed out to make room for the meat. The owner is really nice and I believe that this place has the best BBQ in SF.....

*drool* this is the best bbq in town, and possibly the universe. the meats are smoked so well that you don't need to slather them in sauces to make them tasty - in fact, i rarely dip my pork ribs or beef brisket (my personal faves) in any of the sauces at all. i highly recommend this place, delicious!!!!! plus, the owner is a highly personable guy who's around a lot, which, as Alexis said in her post, is always a good sign. ? expect to pay a little more than you expect to for bbq, but i think it's worth it.

Bitch Bitch moan complain. 1) No, this isn't North Carolina. Thank God. 2) yes, the guy who owns it is Jewish...so what, are you an anti-semite? You think Jews Can't Que? All I know is that you can get, sometimes for as low as $8, an ungodly amount of delicious rib tips long smoked until they nearly melt. You can help yourself to as much sauce you like from three different handcrafted versions (I like the Texas best myself, what with the hint of star anise flavor), but purists say you should just eat the meat. Then you also get two generous sides of large calorie items...the mac and cheese is great, if not exactly healthy.....the greens are a bit sweet, but also sour and delish. I'm not such a fan of the beans, but they are different than other places. The cornbread is pretty good and you get a piece of that too...so for $8-10 you can feed one extremely person or two smaller appetited folks....so what the heck are you all complaining about?

Not to beat the proverbial (vegetable protein) dead horse, but I don't eat meat. ?That said, Memphis Minnie's is not a natural go-to restaurant for me, but nonetheless, I've been a time or two. I am able to speak to the tastiness of the corn bread muffins, the sweet potatoes, and the potato salad: Memphis Minnie's really knows how to whip up a damn fine starch. ?Plus, they've got sake, and everyone knows that herbivores love sake. My fondest memory of exemplary service at Minnie's is when one of the employees overheard my table debating the ingredients of mincemeat pie. ?He sort of got himself in to the conversation, but couldn't offer any answers; ten minutes later, he walked back over with the Joy of Cooking and elucidated his findings. ?(Turns out we were all both right and wrong.)

Awesome place with some kickass smokey flavored ribs. Pity that when we got there that night, they were out of most of the items so we did not get to try those Pork Ribs but we will make another visit for that next time. We did manage to get our hands on the pulled pork and also the big beef ribs. The meats tasted succulent on their own but if you needed more flavor, just slather on those sauces they provide on the tables. My favourite is the vinegar one which pairs perfectly with that juicy meaty flavor! I was soo looking forward to the banana pudding since everyone was raving about it but guess we will have to be back for that once again! So the meal was well worth the hunt for the parking spot and well worth that long wait outta the door

My first taste of SF barbecue, and the immediate inspiration I had was to open up an Arkansas outpost in the city. The coleslaw wasn't even a good vinaigrette, not nearly enough to make up for omitting mayonnaise. Potato salad was similarly disappointing. I've had the brisket and the pork, which were both fine, but not exactly stones from the foundation of genuine bbq -- which leads me to the sauces, all of which failed the simple test of being spicy, flavorful, and tangy. Three stars because I was full afterward.

You don't find too many ribs joints in SF, let alone quality rib joints. ?So, to my surprise, here stands a restaurant that not only satisfies my desire to pork out on fried foods (mmm...sweet potato fries...drool), but also offers up an eclectic pairing of sake and briskets. ?I've been there a few times, and each time, the food tasted great. ?My only beef (pardon the pun) is how was tough it is to find a table during peak dinner hours, when 40 diners fight over 4 tables (actually..more like benches). ?Oh, the bonus for me is, Memphis Minnie's is one of a select few restaurants in SF that is part of the AAdvantage Elite Dining service...meaning I get triple (or was it quadruple) points on every dollar spent. ?No, I'm not a American Airlines marketing rep...I'm just someone who likes to collect miles and fly for free.

This place has decent barbecue. I have to say that I really like the fact that their meat is done well, and you have the option of choosing your own sauce.(self-service from bottles placed on each table) If you prefer a sauce with a "bite", they have one that has a balanced mix of vinegar, mustard, and brown sugar. This is the variety of sauce I am accustomed to, and prefer it over any other. The other two sauces seemed less sharp, and one bordered on downright sweet. ?Barbecue is quite literally ?a matter of taste, and in large part depends on whether you are a 1) meat person, or a 2) sauce person. ?Memphis Minnies seems to deliver on either count. The meat was good, but the sauce made it (as we say in Texas) "gooder than gum" !! The restaurant itself reminds me of a hole in the wall. The clientele was an eclectic mix of folks and the place can get crowded, as seating is limited . Give this place a whirl. I don't think you will be disappointed.

Authentic? ?No. ?Great barbeque? ?Not really. ?Pork can be dry, depending on the day, cornbread also can be dry. ?Mac and cheese is a oozy mess of goodness, ?Great place to go when you're hungry and want to overeat and feel sick but satisfied. ?I'll go back.

Yay! Another spot with real deal bbq. Such a rare find now a days. Had the brisket and ribs, wow melt in your mouth brisket. The ribs however, were really dried out, a bad day maybe? Hence the 4 stars. The catfish and fries were amazing and the sauces all made from scratch goodness! Buttery flakey fish, yummy get in my belly goodness. The potato salad and beans uber goodness.

What can I say, this is as good as it gets here in San Francisco. ?The meat was decent but what is the deal with the sauces? ?The vinegar and mustard sauce should be removed quietly out the back door leaving only a mediocre BBQ sauce that leaves a lot to be said for. ?The staff is helpful and the crowed is pretty much your urban trendy skinny jeans and t-shirts with vests. ?Then again this is the lower Height. ?If you're looking for decent BBQ, I'd suggest heading over to Oakland. ?It's not bad, but I'm sure you've all had better...I know I have.

I'm from TX. I know BBQ. ?This ain't it. ?Sorry, guys. I came here last week under the promise that this was the best barbeque in the city. ?That may be true, but I guess that means the city falls way short in terms of BBQ standards. I got the brisket, mac n cheese, and sweet potatoes. ?I also had a small taste of my friend's beans which were good. My brisket was okay, but was on the dry side. ?They had a couple of side sauces which were flavorful and used to drench the meat. ?The mac n cheese was so-so, but could have been a bit tastier. ?The best part of my meal were the sweet potatoes. Oh, and don't even bother with the cornbread. ?It's not worth it.

Oh the pulled pork! ?I've been here about 20 times, and the pork is their drawing card. ?Tender, sweet, flavorful meat with a smoky bark on it. ?No other place in the bay area comes close to their pulled pork. ?Their brisket is good, and he smokes it for 18 hours. ?The ribs are great one day and ok the next. ?The skinny fries are seasoned and are another highlight here. The pecan pie was sweet and crunchy. ?They serve saki? ?One of my favorites is the Southern Star, ?a french roll with pork on one side and brisket on the other. They also have deep fried egg rolls.

mmmmmmm, i was craving BBQ so badly when i walked in here. i ordered just the plain and simple half rack of ribs. it was delishhhh.. only complaint is that the tables were filthy and it took the busser a long ass time to clean them off. and also there bbq wings were a tad too dry for my taste. and they were coated in some weird candy hard bbq sauce. but the FRIES and MAC n CHEESE there are off the chain good. mmmmm i could sit here all day clogging my arteries. first time u go ORDER THE REAL RIBS, none of this sandwich sh*t... ;)

I have to agree that the pork ribs are excellent, however the side dishes are pretty mediocre. ?After grabbing drinks across the street at Noc Noc my friend and got a light dinner- shared the pork ribs that comes with 2 small side dishes and corn bread muffin. ?We tried the coleslaw and sweet potatoes,.. nothing special and even though i LOVE corn bread.. it was too dry for me to have more than a few nibbles. ?Stick with the pork ribs and don't have high expectations for the side dishes.

As close to Memphis BBQ as you are going to get here in SF. I'll start from the least impressive to the most. The rib tips, overcooked and not very good. Might as well not even bother with the sides, but since we got the three meat platter, they came with it. The cole slaw was barely edible and the mac n cheese was boring. Now to the good stuff. The Pork ribs were good. The Pulled pork was even better, nice and tender. The beef brisket was the best, perfectly cooked. The SC/NC/Texas sauces options were odd, but I guess they want to let the customer choose the sauce flavor for themselves...

Let me say first that I generally despise BBQ with its otherwise bland meats covered with sickly sweet sauce. ?Luckily, a foodie friend educated me in the ways of BBQ and sent me over to Memphis Minnie's. ?Their flavorful dry rub means that I can go without the sauces and still be satisfied. ?Granted I'm no expert on Memphis style BBQ (I've been to Memphis only once), but what I can say is that Memphis Minnie's serves up some excellent comfort food.

bff said that they were just having a bad night...but sadly, i must review the place for what it was...and well, it wasn't horrible but it wasn't good either. there were 4 of us and we decided to get 2 of the two way combos...which comes with 2 meats and 2 sides each. ?we chose brisket, tri tip, chicken, and sausage. ?each meat was pretty dry...the chicken was still raw...the best out of the 4 was the sausage..which shouldn't be the meat that shines at an all bbq place. ?the sides we had were also less than mediocre. ?the greens were SUPER sour. ?we got the butt end of the mac n cheese...while a new fresh pan came out for all of the guests after us. ?the cornbread was also pretty dry...it was just a sad meal. the bbq sauces were ok..the best out of the 4 was the carolina mustard sauce. ?but, i have to say that the chili cheese fries were pretty good. ?it was really salty...but the idea was awesome. ?they put their 18 hour brisket into this chili...not bad at all. ? i'm still searching for the best bbq in the city...memphis minnie's was a disappointment. ?but bff said we've gotta give them another try...so an update will be coming soon!

BBQ!!! ?Most of what I've tried here is excellent! ?The chicken has been a little on the dry side both times I tried it, but the ribs, sausages, and brisket were delicious! ?Sides are good but they could be a little bigger. ?I love the 3 different sauces - vinegar, mustard, and red, and I think now they have a hot sauce too . . . ?I came here for my bachelor party and the brisket was so damn good it inspired me to get my own smoker (wife got it for me for xmas!) but I'm not sure I can match the majesty and splendor of that hunk of meat they served us! why the 4 then? ?chicken could be improved (it was still good, just not as good as their other meats) and the sides are kinda small. ?If I could I'd give it a 4.5.

First bbq I've ever tried in the city...I had the sweet pork, and tasted the brisket (kinda dry) with some beef bones. Personally I like the sides better than the actual bbq. Good comfort food, tasty seasoned fries, macncheese and tangy slaw. No waiters, but they asked us how the meal was at the end. They've got Sierra and Anchor on tap, and the prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. 3 sauces-red bbq my fave, then the mustard, followed by the vinegar. I sat in the corner at a small table by the john, which was a little annoying at times. I'd go back to try the brunch.

Good for lunch, dinner, take-out and weekend brunch. ?Sure hits - brisket (smoked 18+ hours) plate or sandwich, smoked pork plate or sandwich, smoked pork or brisket hash (weekends only), tart n' tangy slaw (vinegary crispy goodness, excellent when put on the sandwich). ?The fries are decent, but often cold and limp. ?Tasy and tangy collards if you go for that sort of thing. ?(I do.) I seem to like the cornmuffins more than most. ?I've only been a handful of times, but look forward to going back and trying different items.

Tasty Barbequed food. I had the pork spring rolls, which were very tasty (especially the sauce that goes on the top). In fact, I ate the second one the next day for breakfast (go figure). The prices were fairly low, and you get your food almost immediately. Can't really beat it.

i decided to swing in here on my way home from work. i liked the feel of the inside of the joint. it's got a homey feel, fun bbq shirts filling up the walls, and tons of pig statues around. my order: smoke pork ribs with slaw, mac & cheese, and a side order of grit stix. upon opening my package, i first noticed i had potato salad instead of slaw (i did over hear them mention they were out, but no one ever told me). the potato salad was ok, but i would have loved to try the slaw. i really enjoyed the mac & cheese, maybe a lil less pepper, tad more salt, but creamy delicious. cornbread was good, not as good as Cajun Pacific's, but good. the ribs were falling off the bone. sauce on the side (not liking either sauce very much, one had a overly taste of cinnamon), but i didn't really enjoy the thick rub on the meat. i didn't enjoy the flavor, but i loved how tender it was. grit stix were fun and different, didn't love them, but enjoyed them. i definitely will come back to try some other stuff out.

I guess don't go there later at night. I was sorely disappointed by my food. I can only hope the reason was that it was late at night and they were close to closing? (but seriously if you're open that late at night, the food should be good all day long no?) Anyway, I had the rib tips. They were hella dry. I can kind of see where the flavor was coming from but they were just so dry. It was not enjoyable to eat. For a place that specializes in cooking meats, perfection should be moist, juicy ribs. I'm pretty happy as long as the ribs are you know, some what juicy. Totally dry at Memphis Minnie's. The corn bread was also gritty which was strange. Anyway, that's why I had to pull it down to 2 stars. I thought about giving it 3 stars, but really those ribs do not deserve 3 stars. I'm willing to try it again, maybe earlier in the day. On the plus side, a friend's fried chicken sandwich was pretty good. And the people are nice. But c'moooon, you gotta kill it on the ribs. No deal for me.

Although I rated this place a 3, I really gave it a 3.45, but couldn't find the heart to round it up to a 4. ?I tried the beef brisket and smoked sausage and the beef was for the most part tender, although the ends of the slices were very dried out. ?The sausage was a bit spicy for me but had a good flavor. ?The fries were pretty good...freshly cut and "barbecue" seasoned with a sugary tint. ?The macaroni was an interesting combination of cheese and cornbread. ?You get a choice of three barbecue sauces at your table (North Carolina vinegar, red hot sauce and mustard something) and i tried the red sauce. ?I felt it was lacking a bit in flavor and it was a bit on the watery side and cold (a bit cooler than room temp), which didn't work well with my hot meat. ?I was a little annoyed that the water dispenser that kept giving me pink water and I was also a little disturbed by the alternating honky tonk and zydeco music playing overhead. ?Sorry the zydeco just didn't fit with the barbecue to me. ?Where are they supposed to be hailing from? ?Memphis, Texas, or Louisiana? The servers were nice enough and my food came up in 2 minutes literally. ?The meat was good, but I've had a lot better, but this is San Francisco, so ok, I may have to lower my expectations a bit. ?(I'm originally from Texas and went to college for 5 years in Memphis if you're wondering). ?Like I said a strong 3 rating, but I'm open to changing my rating for better or worse when I go back and try the fried catfish and ribs and try some more sides. 11/5 Update: ?Gonna have to knock this one down to a 2. ?I've visited 7 times now since I live in the neighborhood and my experiences have been going downhill in quality ever since. ?I still think the catfish is tasty, but I ordered a barbecue sandwich this past time and the bread was wrong for the sandwich, the meat was cold, and the barbecue sauces on the side were cold. ?Why oh why would you ever serve someone cold meat and cold barbecue sauce, or hot meat and cold barbecue sauce?

Best BBQ I've had in SF. Nice kitschy atmosphere and friendly, helpful staff. The meats are delicious, as is the chicken. They don't overdo it on the sauce so you can actually taste the meat, but a variety of sauces are provided to kick it up a notch if one desires. They take their time slow-cooking the meat here and it shows- the brisket is absolutely melt-in your mouth delicious. Haven't had a bad meal here and I will definitely keep going back.

I've been wanting to try this place for a long time. Reading all the great reviews I couldn't wait to eat here. I tried the half and half sandwich (half brisket half smoked pork) with the BBQ seasoned fries. Either I went on an off day or my taste buds are not working very well! The only reason this place got two stars is because the brisket was very tender but aside from that...forget about it! Everything tasted like charcoal fuel...so bad that you couldn't even hide it with BBQ sauce. And the fries...lets just say that they looked like they needed some Viagra...I'm just not into limp fries! I should probably try it again, just to give it another chance but for right now it barely gets two stars.

I love ribs and pulled pork sandwiches so I had high hopes for Memphis Minnie's. ?Alas, this place just doesn't do it for me. ?Its pretty average. The brisket usually looks pretty good, but alot of times the other meat is too dry. ?To compensate, you'll need to use alot of their bbq sauce which is just ok. ?The little corn bread muffins are a pretty good side. ?The greens on the other hand are a pretty disgusting side. ?They're so overwhelmingly drenched in their mustard sauce that its almost inedible. ?Stick to the brisket and you'll probably be fan. ?The rest is a bit of a crapshoot.

After moving to SF from the South, I thought I had sadly kissed my BBQ-eating days good bye. I was gladly mistaken! Living so close to Memphis Minnie's has made my life make sense again. Sweat Tea will make any real human's life worth living, and this does a pretty good job at living up to my syrupy standards.

No one wants to leave their slice of glory unattended to refill their sauce chalices! Brisket = amazing. Pulled pork = amazing. All sides = '!!!' (anything to do with) Grits = amazing. Haters be stopped! Please do your psyche a favor and eat some soul food (Monday's excluded).

not mad memphis. not bad. came here for a protein heavy easter sunday feast, dressed in my church bests. after shielding myself with the table paper towels from head to foot, i was ready to begin. the food came out quick. like too quick. i ordered and before i literally had the chance to walk the 10 feet to sit down, my food was ready. clearly pre-made. i'm okay with that, as long as its served hot. it was kind of warm, but not hot. sad times. got the st louis ribs, beef brisket, and pulled pork. i thought the beef brisket was definitely the best. the ribs were decent, but were kind of weird. they werent dry rub, and they werent wet either. something in between that were decent in its own right. the pulled pork was a little dry in my opinion. it's funny that memphis minnies doesnt have memphis style ribs. you'd think they would, no? sweet tea was great, cole-slaw was made with some sort of pickled mild jalapenos and without mayo (for better or worse), macaroni and cheese was okay. 25 for 2 people make this pretty reasonable. the food was tasty enough, but i don't think a bbq critic would have been impressed. worth a visit, but i won't be running back.

The food is ridiculous here. This is how you flirt with danger, and don't dine alone because you need someone to call 911 just in case. The cheese grits sticks are irresistible, and the mac 'n' cheese and greens are excellent. And those are just the sides. The ribs, pulled pork, and chicken are pretty nice too. Oh, and that sauce...

Went there for the first time with my girlfriend last week. I had the pulled pork and brisket and it was awesome! They even had North Carolina style vinegar barbeque sauce, which I LOVE, being from NC. Both cuts of meat were moist, tender and delicious! I had the cole slaw and mac and cheese, both of which were very good. We also had the brisket covered cheese fries which was good but a little too salty for my taste. The bacon pecan brittle was amazing! Definitely recommend them, definitely going back!

This place was pretty good but some of the meats were dry and the beans were hard. Table was dirty and I had to clean it myself before sitting down. I ordered the mixed meat combination which included pork ribs and brisket and something else. Two of the three meats were dry and not so good but one of them was incredible and tender and juicy. I don't know for sure but I assume that was the brisket. They serve sake which was a nice suprise. A good solid place and I enjoyed some of the meal but can't give more than 3 stars.

Now that Brother-in-Laws is gone (or morphed for the worse), i think this is the best BBQ in SF. that's somewhat faint praise, but still, it's pretty tasty. we were there this weekend at a very busy moment and the guy working the floor was working his ass off --- it was still a little crazy, but no fault of his. i like the brisket and the pulled pork. tie between 3 and 4 stars goes up because of the hard-working kid who got us extra beers.

So app-on much recommendation from friends and seeing as this place is in my neighborhood I finally decided to take a walk and find out what all the hype was about. I love bbq and soul food and am always looking for a new place to call comfort town. This place however did not live up to the hype. Sides were unbelievably small and not that tasty. There was no fried chicken. I had the spicy pulled chicken sandwich and it was less than ?desirable. Dry and not at all seasoned. There was absolutely nothing on the sandwich which would've been fine had the meat been all that it was cracked up to be but in this case not so much. The sauces were alright at best watery and not really all that interesting when it came to taste. I found myself drenching the damn sandwich in the mustard sauce to choke it down. Its a bit pricey for what you get and I suggest ordering the tri-tip or pork ribs with like ten sides if your going to check this place out. The one cool thing is that they do have brunch, the atmosphere is delightful...with brightly colored tablecloths and lots of chatchki on the walls to look at. Unfortunately it doesn't distract you from the fact that their BBQ was less than I expected. But hey thats what I get for expecting the best!

this review will probably sound a little skewed seeing as how ive been to minnies once and it was right before closing but... so the bex and i walk in probably less then an hour before this joint closed (10pm on a friday!? why the f* does everywhere close early in this F*ing city?). she got some sort of bbq plate with two sides and i got a beef brisket sandwich. the meat in my sandwich was ok... pretty tender and good texture but pretty bland. i mean, if it werent for the mustard/hot/vinegar-y sauces, my tongue would have died of boredom. bex's bbq wasnt any better and actually was pretty worse! it was cold, and dry and the flavors were negligible. i dont even think the sauces helped. the worst part of the whole memphis minnies experience was that after we stared at the menu for a solid 10 minutes and had our hearts set on our respective sides, they told us they were out of the garlic fries and mac and cheese. what they did have, however, was the audacity to brag about how good their mac and cheese was even though they didnt have any. come to think of it, i dont think beef brisket sandwich was my first choice either, but they didnt have what i originally wanted. maybe we came in at a bad time? maybe next time ill come in when there's some food left. then again, i dont see that next time anywhere in the near future.

Ordered the St.Louis ribs and the brisket-both were considerably dry and tasteless. ?You really needed to pour on the sauce so the meat wouldn't stick to the roof of your mouth! ?The greens and slaw were heavily laced with vinegar-a bit too acidic for my taste. ?Prices are on the high side-spent over $34 for lunch for two and that's without a drink! ?The staff gets a star for their friendly attitude but I won't be back.

give me an f'ing break. (can i swear on here?) this place sucks. the only reason i gave it one star is 'cuz it beats eating out of a garbage can (actually, i know some good garbage cans that serve better food). i've eaten there twice and was severely underwhelmed both times. the owner's "no extra sauce 'cuz i want people to taste the rub & smoke in the meat" policy is a load of crap as far as i'm concerned. also, you'd think with 3 or 4 "various styles" of "regional sauces" at least one would be good, as opposed to all of them toeing the line between bland & unpalatable. the sides are decent, but what's the point if the main course is so dry and bland. i hate to be so negative, but considering how hyped up this place is, it NEEDS to be taken down a notch. ugh. i've been to chain restaurants with better bbq.

You in the need of BBQ but do not know anybody that is throwing a party or just too lazy to fire up the grill? No problem, ?Memphis Minnie's is the place for you. ?When you first go in here, you probably notice the awards this place has for best BBQ in the city and to me, their is no lying about that. ?We started out with the pork egg rolls and it was pretty damn good. ?For the main dish, I had the beef brisket and the pork ribs dipped it with some Carolina Mustard and Texas Red Sauce and you have yourself one good old BBQ. ?Parking in the lower haight area is kinda tough so you may have to be patient to get your hands on some good BBQ when you go here.

Come in and do not sit down yet. Not even to get dibs on a table was what we were told by the big guy at the cash register. Other than that odd intro the food was amazing. I ordered the sweet pork sandwich with a side of sweet potatoes. They've got these huge bottles of bbq sauces- a tangy mustard, Texas red sauce and one called STUPID HOT (very Bay area!) It'll make you truly stupid so drink lots o water. I personally like the red sauce more. Sweet potatoes was good but too sweet. Decent prices, just scout tables like a hawk.

Memphis Minnie's has delicious barbecue. Chicken, beef brisket, pulled pork - it's all good. If you are trying to watch what you eat, steer well clear of the sweet smoked pulled pork as it is about 30% fat. ?Their sides are pretty solid too--I recommend the greens, delicious! 3 sauces at every table - red sauce, vinegar sauce, mustard sauce. If you want real spicy sauce grab it from the counter before you sit down. They have a small beer selection and a surprisingly large sake selection - try it, sake goes real well with BBQ! Sandwiches at around $8, platters at around $12.

I was extremely disappointed of my visit to this place. My gf told me she remembered going there and it was good and her brother in law loved it. Since I love Rosamunde and Toronado so much I thought why not try this place out. So we split a 3 entree (St. Louis Ribs, Pork and Brisket). All the meats were extremely dry. I was expecting at least the Pork to be moist but I do have to understand that we are in San Francisco and not Texas so maybe that why that was the case. THe BBQ sauces they had on the tables I wasn't too impressed with. THe Mac. And cheese looked like something that was packaged along with the Potatoes. I tried to finish the meal as fast as possible so I can get a drink at Toronado and forget about this place. This definitely goes on my Ban list.

At this point I've had almost every meat o the menu and I've never been disappointed. The meat has great smoky flavor and is juicy and tender. The sauce is also top notch.

The food isn't bad here but the service is a complete joke. ?I've gone here on three occasions for takeout and every time, it's the same story. ?There's a single guy on cash who refuses to let you pick up your takeout until it's your turn in line -- and the line usually takes 25-30 minutes to clear up because it's all first-time diners who need to be walked through the whole menu. ?Note that it is ALL first time diners. ?I think I may be the only person who went here more than once. The food isn't bad, but as far as BBQ goes, I'd check out some other places on Yelp. ?This place is pricey for what they offer, the ambiance is Chuck-E-Cheese mixed with Denny's and the service can induce a heart attack more than the cholesterol-laden food they serve. That said - if they had a sign saying "takeout orders - please come to front of line" and adhered to that policy, I'd give this place an extra one or two stars. ?Still pretty overpriced, though.

memphis minnies was the first bbq joint i hit up when i moved out to the city years ago. i remember having the brisket sandwich... i remember it being super delicious and i was a little mad at myself for not ordering more! this time i knew i was going to do it right. it was a good thing that i had my girlfriend with me this time to help me out. we got the 2 meat combo (brisket and pork ribs) with 2 sides (mac and cheese and collard greens) and brisket chili cheese fries. The meat was tender and tasty, mac and cheese was solid but i think the collard greens were a little too "tangy" for my taste, and the brisket chili cheese fries were mind blowing. I mean, those fries could feed a small village or in our case... can send two people into a 30 min "i ate too much" nap. Memphis Minnie's... it's been a long time but i'm glad we got we got to reunite.

Who knew Lower Haight would have such a great BBQ place? I ended up here after the recommendation of my partner who had been before with a friend. Having been spoiled by Armadillo Willy's in the south bay for so long, I had no idea I'd ever be able to find something even close to what they delivered but Memphis Minnie's fit the bill! I had the tri-tip plate with potato salad and mac & cheese for the sides. After I orderded I was shocked to find they even have frito pie (a reason to come back for sure). I easily could have eaten an entire plate of their mac & cheese; it was that good. The place isn't huge however it can accomodate a large group (say 12 people). The atmosphere is pig kitsch with every pig figurine, pig t-shirt, or pig memoribilia available plastered all over the place.

Being one of the very few dedicated BBQ joints already earns it some stars, but the food does fall short. No service to speak up, but some funny guys behind the counter. The pork is not bad, but not tasty enough on its own, yet I wasn't into their BBQ sauces, so overall didn't provide for the best meal. There are a couple of the standard BBQ sides, but they also are not that great. The cornbread was a little too sweet with out the balancing salt for my taste. Their breakfast menu seems promising, gotta try it sometime. It's not inexpensive, but BBQ rarely is. I just order the meat in pounds and get sides to make my own plate of food. It is a good place if your craving southern BBQ and don't have hours/days to grill your meats.

4.5 stars Every meal I've had here has been enjoyable and well executed. ?Today I had an andouille sausage sandwich and Liz had the Memphis style pork (pulled pork) and both were excellent, as were the sides of cole slaw and potato salad. ?There really isn't better BBQ to be had in the Bay Area - at least not that I've found. ?Having spent 10 years in Texas and 4+ in Tennessee, I've had my fair share of BBQ. ?Though I'm fond of a few places in these far away states, my meals at Memphis Minnie's have been pretty close in comparison. ?I've sat with the owner for a while discussing BBQ, and can really appreciate his method for learning the technique of the different styles on offer. ?He's travelled to all of these areas on several occasions to understand and emmulate them, and I think he does a hell of a job. ?My only complaint on this visit was the consistency of the pork - there wasn't quite enough texture. ?I like to have some slightly chewy or at least stringy bits in my pulled pork, and this was fairly soft and pillowy. ?Perhaps that's what he was going for. ?The flavor is pretty spot on, but the smoky intensity of the pulled pork I've had a hunudred times in Nashville and Memphis was also sort of missing. ? Ok, I guess that's two things. The andouille was also very good, the only drawback being that it was overly salty. ?It was certainly still edible, and enjoyable, but if the salt were turned down a bit it would have been heavenly (and the heat turned up a tad). I have to add that this is the first time I've tried the sambos there, and I was very impressed. ?They arrive as just meat and bread, which looks a bit sparse, but with your three choices of BBQ sauce on the table (Texas style (cumin and tomato driven), South Carolina style (mustard base) and North Carolina style (vinegar base)) you're all set. ?The bread is a sweet french roll, and very moist and complimentary to the meat. ?I was expecting these to be dry, but the whole combo is very enjoyable. ? Try it!

I must admit that they know my name here. It's not that it's the best BBQ in San Francisco, but it is really damn good comfort food. The sauces are all stand outs in their own right. I usually go for a chicken sandwich with coleslaw (think vinegar and tang, not mayonnaise) and macaroni cheese (topped with yummy cornbread crumbs). The iced tea is a must. And if you have a sweet tooth, I whole heartedly suggest the pecan pie.

I heard one patron say that he'd traveled all the way from the east bay to check this place out, man would I be pissed if I'd made that trip. One thing that made no sense to me, it's called Memphis Minnie's, but doesn't have a sweet sauce option, just Texas, North and South Carolina styles, that seems odd. Anyway, the meat lacked any smoky flavor, the brisket barely had a pink ring. In general the meat was as dry as a bone. 18 hours my ass, it must of spent another 18 sitting in a warming tray. I might give this place 1 more try in case i caught it on a bad day, Sunday afternoon, but otherwise I won't bother going back.

I came home one night, late from work and the gym, starving for nourishment. ?I walk in and smell burnt animal. ?Was there an accident with her dog perhaps. ?Nope, My girlfriend had Ribs from M.M. for dinner, (defeat) and saved a few for me (success). ?She's great, and I owe her or kharma a lot for those things. ?I had only 2 ribs, but they were by far the best I've had in the bay, and the sauces were succulent. ? It immediately reminded me of a David Cross bit about a service for Jewish people. ?"I have a few business ideas (that I'm going to advertise in High Times, amongst other places), and one of them is for a nominal fee, I provide a service where I will eat and describe pork to Kosher people. ?And it goes something like this... ?MMMmmmmmmmM, ?dude ooooooohhh, ?MmmmMmm. dude. ?Falling off the bone... succulent, juicy meat. ?ooooh, so good. ?Why doesn't your God let you eat this? ?Oh, really, no idea. ?Sucks for you!" ?-(David Cross) And thats how good memphis minnies bbq is. ?It makes me laugh, food doesn't normally do that.

macaroni and cheese is not exactly the hardest thing to make and make well, but MM seemed to miss the obvious. the mac was liquidy and lacking in cheesiness, and was utterly bland. the cornbread had an odd texture and was dry and grainy. i also had the sweet pork and the pork ribs. the sweet pork was kind of dry and probably could have been cooked in a sauce to make it better--like they do in the south. the ribs were overcooked. i really wanted my fix of bbq, but i guess i'll have to ask my dad to make me some ribs for the fourth of july. his beat MM by about a thousand times.

First, I really wish there were more choices for ratings... This is definitely only 3 1/2* BUT, as far as the bay area so far, and BBQ, it IS 4... First.... had pretty low hopes, on the basis of YELP ratings (learning to not always trust that!) and the location (super-hip, not generally a good sign for BBQ) But, the menu looked good, and overall it did not disappoint. This was carryout, and the hubby picked it up, so can'ts says anything about the place, though he said it looked nice.... Start with the ribs, always the ribs... GOOD to very good... if anything, a bit overcooked (but better than undercooked imho). Flavor, good. Asked for the sauce on the side (finally realized that here in the bay they DROWN bbq in sauce - what are they hiding?!) Sauce was good, but a bit too sweet, fruity and oddly spiced... but not bad. Can't say the same for the other sauce, the mustardy one.... we didn't like it. Too much like honey mustard dressing. Next: brisket. Very good, but a bit fatty ( I can't believe I just said that! Fat is SO my friend! But it's true!) tender and good flavor. Wings - good, but definitely overcooked. Dry, dry, dry... not easy do that to wings, either! So, the sides: Potato salad was 3* easily. Coleslaw was NOT what I wanted (like it creamy) but it was GREAT, if a bit on the sweet side (like everything). Well, 3 1/2* for sure. Fries...Surprisingly good! 3 1/2*. corn muffins: too sweet, but actually very corny! 3 1/2*.... I sense a trend with this 3 1/2* thing! So, all in all, Memphis Minnie would warrant a return! For sure... And I could easily be persuaded to LOVE this place, if it were a little less sweet! :)

Actually 3.5 stars. I had the 2-way platter which lets you choose two bbq meats and two sides. I remember I had a lot of meat (which can sure be a plus for some people), but I think half the fun of comfort food is the delicious sides. At Memphis Minnie's the sides were good but not necessarily stellar, and a bit unbalanced (on the small side) for the amount of meat. However, I'll admit that the bbq is good - I especially enjoyed the brisket and then you top off with more bbq sauce and a touch of mustard at the table. YUM. But if I were to eat this much meat, I'd rather have a good cut of rib eye or prime rib. Just personal preference.

I think I've never had a bad meal here...except I've learned that the mac n cheese is not as good as it used to be...so I've moved on to the potato salad and sweet potatoes, which are both good, as well as their tasty cornbread. I like their sandwiches, you can get a couple of the bbq sauces to dip them in. The NC bbq sauce has grown on me and I do believe is the best one with chicken or turkey. The pork and beef items are a bit lost on me, but I hear the beef brisket is pretty good. You can also pair your bbq with sake and it actually suits it quite nicely.

This is really a 3.5 star place. I think they are the exact opposite of Nates in that all the things surrounding the meat are superior (price, sides, atmosphere, sauces) but the meat can sometimes fail to deliver due to dryness. I've eaten there 3 times and it just didn't pull me in enough to want to go back. Especially with Rosemundes Sausages right across the street.

Memphis Minnie's is DISGUSTING. Don't eat here. Ever. I went with my boyfriend last night and we both got the ribs, which were not tender and devoid of any flavor, and abundant with chewy (yet gelatinous) fat. We each got two sides, I had the greens and slaw. Both were completely DRENCHED in vinegar. I ate most of my greens, only to satisfy my hunger, as I wasn't eating anything else. Luckily I had a nice pint of beer to wash all that vinegary flavor down. My boyfriend got beans and potato salad as his sides. Much better choices, but absolutely nothing to write home about. As for the sauces, there are 3 choices. They might as well call these Vinegar #1, Vinegar #2, and Vinegar #3. Blech. Heed my warning. Eat somewhere else. ANYWHERE.

Meh. ?People rave and I had high expectations. ?The mac and cheese is fantastic, the brisket is really good. ?But it's a BBQ joint, so the coleslaw shouldn't be swimming in vinegar, the sauces should be thicker, tangier and spicier, and the ribs should have some flava. ?And I wish there were more than 2 beers on tap. ?Stella + Anchor don't cut it when you've come from Tornado.

You can't help but to notice the little red building with its windows ablaze and the cartoon like sign featuring a jolly chef toque adorned porker. We actually came across it as if by mistake. After being smacked in the nose by the aroma of wood smoked meat we frantically looked around wondering where the intoxicating BBQ smells were coming from. When you enter you find yourself transported instantly to the Deep South. The smell of barbecue is heavy in the air and there is row of tables occupied by a wide variety of patrons clearly enjoying their meals. There is a small pie case that displays some of the regional desserts, the sauces that they make, and some piggy influenced chachkis, which can be found all around the restaurant. At first I found the menu board to be a bit complicated. I don't mean to say I didn't understand what the items on it were; I wasn't sure why some of the items were on it. I guess when I really think about it one item kept distracting me; Premium Sake. As it turns out I am not the first to point out that Sake and barbecue are an odd combination. Their official position on the sake is that there are similarities in the long standing traditions and artisanal approach to both, and besides, the Sake tastes great and so does the barbecue so together they are doubly good. Ok, I'll buy that. Some people drink red wine with fish and white wine with beef, and some people will drink Sake with barbecue. Since we just happened to end up at Memphis Minnie's and this was not a planned review I was a bit unprepared to order the variety of foods that I would for a typical menu sampling. Since I was with a couple of other people I just let them know that I would be eating off their plates for the sake of the review. They hesitantly agreed. I ordered the Minnie's Taster; three meats with a choice of two sides. On my plate will be the Texas Big Bones, the 18hour Smoked Texas Brisket, and the Memphis Sweet Smoked Pork. Accompanying those meats will be the Potlikker Greens and the Tart 'n Tangy Slaw. In addition to those I will also be sampling the St. Louis Smoked Pork Ribs. I really had my mind set on the Andouille sausage, alas there was none. In all fairness it does say "Not All Items Are Available All The Time" right on the menu board. I prefer to start with the sides, let's get the supporting cast out of the way so that we can get to the main event. The slaw is crispy and tangy. There are slivers of red onion and bell pepper which compliment the shredded salad. This is not your typical California creamy mayo slaw. The dressing is on this is vinegar based and has a distinct twang to it. There is a sweetness that follows as your taste buds snap back, but it is well balanced and not sugary. The Potlikker Greens are prepared in a classic down south manner, with onion and vinegar and slow cooked tender greens. I found these to be quite delicious but a little sweeter than I like. I did put about half of them down before the sweetness got to me. Center stage was a battle for the best and quite honestly I find it almost impossible to pick the best of these incredible smoked delicacies. The beef ribs are rich and dark with a zesty bark. The meat comes away from the bones cleanly and they are the most tender beef ribs I have ever experienced. Next, the pork shoulder, buttery soft and smoky with just the right amount of spices. The outside pieces are sweet and sticky from the slow cooking process. No knives are needed here. The beef brisket was juicy and tender. The flavors were mesmerizing and the texture was perfect. There was a quarter inch smoke ring on the tender beef slices. The St. Louis Ribs also came away from the bone cleanly. The outside was crusted with spices and slightly charred meat while inside; the tender pork, pink from smoke was juicy and sweet. I struggled with the idea of putting sauce on this perfectly cooked meat but the variety of sauces on the table was intriguing. On the table were three sauces Red, Vinegar, and Mustard sauce. First the Texas Red; Bold, tangy, and sweet, the flavor of ginger and clove stood out. The North Carolina Vinegar Sauce is tangy but not sour. I think the word vinegar in the name of this sauce is a bit misleading. It is fresh and herbal and really wakes up the meat you sprinkle it on. South Carolina mustard sauce is a just little sweet and has a delicate nature. It is a perfect accompaniment for the any of the pork dishes. All of the sauces were balanced and enhanced the meats. They were delicate enough to let the meats natural flavors come through, yet bold enough to stand up to the rich smoky meats that they adorn. In Northern California where you find barbecue restaurants with no pits, and heavily sauced meats cooked in ovens, Memphis Minnie's is a whole new world; like walking through a portal to a land where barbecue matters. The meats are perfectly prepared and the sauce is optional if needed at all.

i loved this place and i would like to think that i have very good taste in bbq considering i'm a so-cal lass and my husband is from texas (who is super picky about bbq and also a fan of MM). ?the two-item plate is the best and the brisket was just exploding with tastiness while the pulled pork was so soft and flavorful. ?the banana pudding was smooth, light and just darling. the joint is on the small side, the staff was nice and the food came along quickly considering the place was jumping the night we went (we had a LARGE group of people dining and they all loved the food as well). ?i didn't venture into the sauces as i felt it would be blasphemy to cover up the perfection that was the meat. ?as far as the negative reviews below, maybe y'all just had a bad chef because my experience was outta sight.

As someone who recently gave up meat, I feel that I must pay homage and say proper goodbyes to one of the things that used to make me happy in my heart: bbq chicken, especially from MMs. I used to wake up dreaming of this place, especially after a long night of drinking, and no matter where I lived in the city, would make a trip for a fix. Fortunately, I can (and do, and will often) still put bbq sauce on non-animal food items. Five stars in my heart, but only four because there is now nothing for me to order there!

This place is good for restaurant BBQ. I think people have this fantasy that restaurant BBQ spots are going to be as good as it would be if you do it at the house. I can honestly cook up the best ribs if you've ever had, but that takes a shit load of time. So I go here on a Wednesday night. I get the Minnie sampler. It comes with 3 meats of your choice and 2 sides. I get the brisket, ribs, and sausage. Those 3 have been good every time except the ribs are a little tough at times. I also get the potato salad and mac and cheese. Its all descent for a Wednesday night BBQ spot.

For years, I thought this was a chain and never patronized the joint. It may not have the authentic and dingy feel of Brother-In-Law's but it's twice as good. For true bbq conoisseurs, it probably won't measure up to local joints in Houston, Memphis, or the Carolinas. But even so, they are still purists although offering a great variety of bbq options. I love the Southern Star sandwich (1/2 memphis pork 1/2 texas brisket). They don't like you to use bbq sauce (so you can experience the flavor of the meat) but their sauces are too good not to use. I could seriously drink a pint of their S. Carolina mustard sauce. The sides and desserts are awesome especially the beans, mac & cheese, banana pudding, and pies. I even had their burger today for lunch and it was great. Pretty cheap too. Love having this in the neighborhood.

I'm originally from Tennessee, so I've sampled a good amount of bbq in my years. So far, I've been here 3 or 4 times in the past year. To me, it's just ok. I've had the brisket, pork, ribs, chicken, sides, etc, pretty much anything you would order. It doesn't compare to bbq back home. The meats were nothing special and the sides were actually kinda bad (mac n chz, cole slaw). The prices are alright and you get a lot of food. I'm crossing this place off my list and moving on to find another BBQ place.

I like the flavors of the sauces, but that's pretty much what kept this place afloat for me. The brisket came out completely delicious - until I realized it was half fat, half overcooked. The turkey, unfortunately, was all overcooked, and dry. The pork was delicious and was hands down the winner of the three, and the sweet potatoes and mac n cheese weren't bad at all, either. For legit BBQ, I'm going to keep looking.

I took my boyfriend here for one of our date nights because we love us some good southern BBQ! I thought it was pretty good! What I enjoyed most was the fries and the various sauces that you can try. It is really heavy food so plan on making it a major meal and make sure you have some tums or something with you when you go because the heartburn will kill you. I will go again if am wanting some BBQ and others are up for it but I am not sure if it would be my 1st choice.

I had a hard time giving in to the superiority of memphies minnies because I grew up in tennessee. ?Memphis Minnies is a postmodern bbq experience. ?It's quite a bit different than traditional southern places, and in the end, is more of a combination from many styles of bbq, as well as other styles of cuisine period (like their bbq pork egg rolls). ? Memphis minnies has taken the things I typically don't like at a bbq joint and made them good again. ?I am a huge fan of their greens, bbq turkey, macaroni, and of course, sweet tea. ?I think the price is pretty reasonable for the portions. ?My only complaint is that they don't have a tennessee sauce.

I've been spoiled by living in Austin and falling in love with Texas brisket, so my expectations run a bit high. ?Minnie's was pretty good-- nice crust, tender, if a little on the fatty side. ?Their sides were just alright. ?Mac n cheese was tasty if a bit too gooey for my liking, and the sweet potatoes were nothing at all. ?They literally took a sweet potato, chopped it up, and blanched it for not-long-enough. ?The BBQ sauces, both the red TX style and the mustard (Memphis? ?Carolina?) style were very good. ?I would definitely go back for some brisket, but I'd run w/different sides.

Not sure why BBQ becomes so unexceptional once you are west of Texas, but there you have it.

After traveling through Memphis on a food tour, I have to say that Memphis Minnie's is a far cry from real, authentic Southern bbq. Not to mention that the prices are probably double what you would pay if you were actually in the deep South. That being said, the food is fairly decent for the city, although if you are craving something a tad more authentic, just venture out a little farther and go to Everett & Jones (the original one) in Berkeley.

I ordered the brisket chili cheese fries and a side of beans. Big chunks of meat in the beans, pimento style (not my favorite), but good nonetheless. The chili cheese fries were enormous. Amazingly seasoned fries that on their own were enough to come back for. The brisket was a little dry, still tasty though. On the table were four sauces, I didn't bother trying the Beelzebub as it had a skull and crossbones, but the rest were exceptional. The staff were very sweet, the cook calling me across the counter by name, he remembered from my order, to see how my food was. The owner, he sure seemed like the owner, taking orders, then checking in with tables as he moved around tending to details. I'll be back.

Not very much to look at while walking Haight street, the que here is more than worth the trip through the doors. First you are hit with the delicious smells that fill the smallish dining/kitchen area. Then comes the tough part deciding what to get, recommend trying the sake also, yes it is still weird to me that a BBQ restaurant with Memphis in the name serves sake, it was quite delicious, try one of the samplers if you can't decide. ?Now comes my favorite part the actual food, the ribs are cooked to perfection and fall apart in your mouth. Don't be afraid of the bottles of sauce on the table not sure if these are different around the restaurant we had SC, NC and TX but TX was the hands down favorite with my squad. If you are lucky you ordered some rib tips, spicky pulled chicken, or pulled pork to go along with your ribs, that is if you still have room after hammering a mini-rack of baby back ribs. Taking a back seat to the meat are the sides, I would only get at these if you can't take any more or in my case finish all your que, they were pretty solid, can't really go wrong with southern style mac and cheese. Go here, eat, and you decide it hasn't won best BBQ in SF numerous times for nothing... how often will you have ribs, mac&cheese, and sake on purpose.

I've been there twice, and often they are sold out of popular items. The restaurant could use a good cleaning. ?Everything is within view, and most surfaces in the kitchen were coated in an inch of burned on grease and grime.The dust and grime clinging to the t-shirts on the walls don't help much either. The food must be inconsistent, since I read all the reviews I could,before going there, and most people stated that the meat was moist. My brisket was dried out completely. Nearly inedible. I imagine after 18 hours of smoke, it got 18 hours of fridge time. I laugh when I see the reviews that state that this BBQ is better than the big boys in the midwest ( Gates, Arthur Bryants etc.) I don't think this place is consistent enough to be considered in the same league. The pork ribs were very good. And the pecan pie is probably the best anyone will ever have. But the pork butt was so bland, flavorless, it was necessary to drown it in bbq sauce just to eat it. I honestly thought it was accidently switched with turkey, cause it had the same mealy texture, and no pork flavor what so ever. It actually had little flavor at all. Places that take pride in their BBQ usually have a pit man checking on the final product going out. Alot of the brisket that doesn't get sold, either because its too dry or whatever, usually goes into the chili pot. My brisket I had was bone dry. There wasn't anyone doing much for quality control here, and I imagine you only get lucky if you are there when someone pulls some fresh meat out of the smoker. Otherwise the quality goes down from there. The worst thing there was their corn muffins. They had an odd smokiness, not like smoke from the bbq, but smoke from the burned on grease that hasn't been cleaned from the pans in a long time. It actually permeated thrughout the muffin, The thick crunchy bits of corn meal are ?odd to chew, but likely up to the individual if they like that sort of thing. The mac n cheese was not all that memorable. It had the taste of artificial cheese sauce, with a scoop of that odd corn meal mixed in just to irritate me again Overall, it was nice to try their ribs. And their pecan pie was worth it, but I dont plan on going back. The parking is horible.

Awesome awesome awesome! Good spot for some quick food. I used to work down by the Hall of Justice and Big Nate's is right around the corner. Now Nate's is legitimate barbecue and well known but God is it overpriced and unsatisfying. So we would call down to Memphis Minnie's and order a bunch of sandwiches etc. My favorite by far is the southern star, the brisket is a close second . The pork and chicken is always flavorful and never dry. Fries on the side were never soggy. If you do drop by this place ask for extra red sauce! It's soooo good!

I was torn whether to give MM four or five stars, because their barbecue IS delicious AND they have South Carolina mustard sauce--nothing makes me happier.

I have overlooked the swings chalking it up to staff differences, but what will keep me away is the recent chicken sandwich I was served. ?It was full of gristle with hints of rotten meat. ?Bad meat - unforgivable. Bob - you need to get back into this kitchen. ? A SF great is very sick.

I'm not a bbq master in any way but I know good brisket when I taste it. Along with the turkey on the weekends with mac and cheese and baked beans make a perfect meaty meal after a hard day at work. If you can take it to go I recommend that over eating there. While it's a fun experience eating shoulder to shoulder to your neighbor I prefer to stretch out and enjoy food like this. Aside form that, the atmosphere is entertaining while you wait for your food and the music is always spot on. Also, I've had a few of those extra dry corn muffins but that hardly sours the experience just use it to sop up the extra red sauce.

I ordered the beef and pork bbq dinners with greens and mac n' cheese. ?Everything was good enough, but nothing amazed me. ?Parking in this neighborhood is difficult and it would be great if they had a curbside take-out service

First impressions; the guy running the register was very friendly, and didn't rush my boyfriend and I while we asked him for recommendations, even though the line was long. ?I also noticed that he made a point of making sure all of his customers had a place to sit as quickly as possible, since the place was packed... that was really nice. ?My only complaint is that I was given a Tri Tip sandwich instead of the Minnie's Pastrami (their Wednesday special), and I didn't know until I got home with our to-go order. ?The food was nonetheless delicious! My man got a half pound of pork ribs, we shared a large order of seasoned fries, and the tart-n-tangy slaw was particularly impressive. ?I would definitely recommend this joint for some good BBQ, just make sure you get what you ordered!

A couple of years ago I would have put 5+ stars but in the past year the quality and consistency of the food at Memphis Minnie's has gone way down hill. Some of the great regulars have left and been replaced by less than stellar new workers who don't seem to have a passion for excellent BBQ like the old crew. Bob is still a talent though I think his long absence has taken a toll on the over-all quality of his restaurant. This use to be a favorite place of our family's and we recommended it to all our friends. Now we've nearly stopped going due to bad service and spotty food. If you do go, try the pulled pork sandwich, the spicy chicken is great when it's done right and the beef is so tasty. Avoid the turkey - it's never been good and has always been that dry. Our favorite sides: potato salad, mac n cheese, spicy french fries and the beans. Hopefully with a bit of a hiring shift the food will once again be the best BBQ in the city.

Their Brisket is their best dish. I recommend this place just for that dish. AND you have to try the beezlebob's hot sauce, it is muy caliente. Sides are ok. Everything else is ok. Tough to find great bbq in SF. Every place in SF that does BBQ has a specialty....one place for ribs, one place for fried chicken, one place for brisket....Memphis Minnie's for brisket. But don't get me wrong, their food is quality.

I know SF in general has nothing on the South when it comes to BBQ, but if you want a fix, and a fun atmosphere with very little 'tude to chow with your friends and drink a cold one before/after you hit the Lower Haight hood, then this place fits the bill! ? Pros: * Nice, messy, large portions, that taste satisfyingly unhealthy * Fun ambiance (pig curio collection, friendly staff when I was there) * Really really cold beer in chilled pint glasses * Wide selection of side dishes * Awesome sauce selection including a hot hot sauce at the counter Cons: * Lighting is pretty harshly bright if you've just come from a dark bar * A tad on the expensive side for a walk-up counter place (but you can split a plate if you wanna save a bit)

I enjoyed the Memphis Minnie's experience on Haight Street. It felt straight out of the southeast USA. However, I am dropping a star because they charge people for a serving of fries, and that makes no sense to me. I had a BBQ chicken sandwich. The interior is raw and old school, but fun. They have an extensive menu, but I might not go there again in San Francisco.

I really hate to take stars off on a business because I know it's hard to make a living running a restaurant, but I just can't really give them a great review. ?I grew up in North Carolina and can tell you that ribs are not supposed to be this dry. ?Nor is cornbread. ?I could barely choke them down with a drink. ?I found the mac & cheese unpalatable, and the fries and beans were unmemorable. ?I tried to like this place because everyone is so ga-ga over it and it's in my hood, but after countless tries, it just makes me miss North Carolina. ?And I never thought that would be possible. ?I always order it to-go, so maybe I will try eating it in-house next. ?For some reason, I want to like it ...

Too expensive, and greens are NOT supposed to be sweet people! They are a vegetable?? I don't know about u but I don't like sugar sweet sauces on my sauteed green veggies. I like them to taste smokey and savory like they should to contrast with the corn muffin. Southerners know what I mean. This place made me feel bad for Peninsula peeps if you think this was good bbq.....you have been deprived.

After all the reviews from my friends, I was expecting some AMAZING bbq. I've recently returned from several business trips to the South (South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia). Their sauces stay true to the vinegar based bbq of the Carolina's. As for the actual bbq, I may have come on an off day, but all the different meats were charred. The brisket and chicken were especially blackened. I know this is BBQ and there should be some smokiness, but this was inedible. I may give them another chance.

Not sure what the food is like, but if you like heaping piles of bad attitude and shitty service, I am sure you will love this place. ? I went in there Friday with two friends. ?While we were waiting in line, a table opened up. ?A sign on the table indicated that it was reserved for parties of three or more. ?The few people in front of us were not in groups of three or more. ?So, while my friends placed our order, I sat down. ?A few seconds later, a hipper-than-thou dude-meister sporting a knife tattoo on his forearm testily asked me if I was ordering. ?After explaining that my friends were ordering he puffed up his chest and claimed that others had been waiting for the seat. ?When I politely pointed out that my friends were nearly at the head of the line and that there were no other groups of three or more he puffed up even more, made some sarcastic comment and angrily ordered me to get out of the seat. ?I left. ? I am rarely surprised anymore by the I-am-too-cool- for-my job attitude that passes for "service" in this town, but for f____s sake! ?Does it really have to be this bad? ?And does this guy really think he is so special that he has some license to treat his customers like shit? ?He's not. ?Sadly, jackasses like him are a dime a dozen.

I love some down home cooking. ?My idea of a dream world is to eat breakfast at Lois the Pie Queen and then start eating BBQ, and not stop until my life ends. ?So searching for tasty BBQ is a lifelong avocation, one with massive ups and crushing lows, kind of like being drunk at a dubstep house party. ?Looney's in Oakland was my favorite when I lived in the East Bay. ?I've moved to San Francsico and I rarely see anything down home or Southern or anything so I figured my craving for BBQ treats might have to go on hold. ?I tried Memphis Minnies, not expecting much. ?Wow! ?It was the best. ?The employees were way pumped, and how could you not be? ?It's nice to walk into a place and have tons of meat everywhere, and people be nice to you. ?It's like the opposite vibe of being in the pit at a hardcore show. ?The guy at the counter had a real homestyle personality. ?I ordered a brisket sandwich and mac and cheese. ?Both were great. ?I tried the sauces and while they weren't the best thing ever (not as good as Looney's), I didn't care, because I'd just spent less money for more food than I had earlier at Zazie and was way more full when I left. ?Epic win.

This place didn't really blow my mind like E&J in Oakland did years ago, but I will say this... 6 out of the 7 of us had the "Hot Sauce" that was supposed to be "stupid hot", and when we got back to the house, 6 out of 7 of us waited patiently for our turn on the bathroom rotation. ?I don't think I've ever seen a bathroom occupied for 2 hours straight like that before.

Well this seems to be really a you-mileage-may-very kind of place, so put me in the fan camp. I found the ribs to be tender and flavorful, and the brisket cuts with a fork and melts in my mouth, my fav is the tri-tips. Don't really like their regular barbque sauce, but the other two flavors are great. I like the corn muffins i have gotten were good but they cook them in bulk and I can see them getting dry sometimes. The mac and cheese is great, the greens are good, as is the potato salad.

Heard about all of the raves about Memphis Minnie's from various sources, so decided to go there after work and bring some barbeque home. I ordered the 3 way - pork ribs, chicken and cajun andouille sausage with mac & cheese and bbq beans; 2 way - pork ribs and chicken with mac & cheese and cole slaw; small side order of cajun fries. The pork ribs and white meat chicken were dry. ?Mac & cheese was okay. ?I liked the cole slaw and beans. ?I watched the guy make the cajun fries. ?Its just thin cut fries and after they were fried, the guy pour a generous amount of seasoning over them and tossed which I would think was probably cajun seasoning. ?The fries were overcooked unless you like crunchy fries and had no real flavor. ?I told my hubby dip them in the bbq sauce. What's up with the corn muffin. ?Is this a southern thing? ?The corn meal wasn't grounded very fine, so there are hard grains in the muffin. The guy who took my order was very nice and friendly and there was a line of people when I left. ?Anyways, tried it, been there... no rush to go back!

I saw Memphis Minnie's on Check Please Bay Area (KQED) and thought I'd give it a try. After reading some good and some not so good reviews, we headed down to the Haight. Sorry to say that this is a not so good one. I went there with my wife and ordered a smoked pork rib plate and a Texas rib plate. The sides were mac n' cheese, greens, baked beans and sweet potatoes. Both plates come with cornbread. The sides were at best mediocre. What you would say "nothing special". The cornbreads were hard and coarse. Now for the really bad news, both the pork ribs and the beef ribs were DRY and TOUGH. Maybe it was because it was 7pm, but they close at 10pm! I don't know, but that was ranked near the bottom of my BBQ list! I just can back from a business trip to Athens, Georgia and I had some ribs to die for there! Tender, juicy and succulent! Sorry, but I won't be back to Memphis Minnie's.

I think this is the best bbq in the city....now, if you're talking the bay area, Minnie's will have some serious competition with Everett/Jones...but if you're just talking SF, this is the place to go for authentic bbq. The food here has been consistent and bonus points for the "special" hot bbq sauces and for having Shiner Bock. It isn't the best beer in the world but it goes very well with southern style bbq. The meats are all tasty(tried them all except for the sausage and chicken)..same for the sides. I haven't tried any of their desserts although I hear they're good as well. I hear the burgers are worth trying too. One thing I believe everyone overlooks @ Memphis Minnie's is the Smokey Mountain Wings. Son-of-a-gun are they good! They're infused with smokey flavor and are some of the tenderest wings I've ever eaten. Almost fall of the bone...not sure how they accomplish this...I know they spend quite some time in the smoker. Just pure sticky smokey goodness. If you're craving buffalo style wings, these might not cut it for you but as far as flavor goes, these are rockin'. Last time I was in Minnie's all we ordered was 3 batches of Smokey Mountain Wings and some beers....and left extremely happy. Haight Street and BBQ! What a combo!

My stars are for service, corn bread, and the sweet tea. There were several people that spoke to us and asked how everything was. The guy at the register called me by my first name when I gave him my debit card and when we left! I'm a southern girl and love BBQ. Personally, I like the "wet rubbed" style. They offer "dry rubbed" at Memphis Minnie's. But it was still pretty good. There were 4 different sauces on the table to choose from. They give you a cornbread muffin with your meal. It is the sweet kind, just the way I like it. My favorite part was the sweet tea! It was prepared perfectly and they offered me one to-go. Yay!

If you love your barbeque smothered in a thick traditional barbeque sauce...GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! This place sells barbeque the way it is supposed to be, smoked a long time with no sauce on it. There is no hiding of flavor behind a plateful of sauce, if your looking for that try Big Nates or the other place on Grove and Divisadero. THE BEEF IS BY FAR THE BEST IN SF., smoked to perfection, very tender and usually cut correctly which is against the grain. However I have had it there once cut incorrectly and probably because the meat cutters are from south of the border (that's how they cut meat down there). The pork ribs seem to be hit and miss, but the last time I had them they were off-the-hook (great). Sometimes they don't have that burnt flesh on them and are also a little tough. The pulled pork is done to perfection and the chicken is just so so. The links are andouille which are really not traditional barbeque and tough. I don't eat beef ribs, but my friends say they are great here. With both good and bad here the only reason I cannot give them more than 3 stars is the sides and the sauce. The mac n cheese is okay, but the rest are just BLAH and needs to be overhauled. The last time I tried the greens (about 8 yrs ago) they actually put barbeque sauce in them...YUK!...and the sauce sucks...YUK x 2. As most barbeque joints go the service is slow, even if you have phoned in, but overall its good eats if you appreciate smoked meats and are not looking for a sauce drenched dinner. If you are a sugarholic, try the sweet tea, it's sweeeeeeeet! And they have an eclectic selection of throwback sodas made with PURE CANE SUGAR! But I guess you can only appreciate cane sugar drinks if you're over 40yrs old. So just so you newborns understand the deal, don't get excited because it's NOT cocaine, it's white granulated sugar that soda was made with when it was called soda pop. You have probably heard about it in those old movies granny watches and have seen bags of it in the grocery store, oh Im sorry, what's that?...Wall Mart in bags that say C & H.

The brisket at this place is to die for. All of the meat I have had here is fantastic (I've never tried the chicken). The fries are great. I am not crazy about the rest of the sides and I am not crazy about the sauces. But the meat is smoked with real wood, it is smoked for the right amount of time and the smoke flavor is present in every bite. It's definitely the best bbq in the bay area, followed by Big Nate's.

for everything else this place serves, I'd say 3 or 2 1/2 stars is more then enough, but holy moley, that Saturday special: SOUTHERN SMOKED FRIED CHICKEN, it deserves to be in all caps, it is literally the BEST DANG FRIED CHICKEN I have ever had in my life, I seriously consider moving to SF, because that chicken blew colonel right out of the water, and Popeye's can suck it, it is the BEST FRIED CHICKEN I will ever put in my mouth, I guarantee it.

i'm glad i finally made it to memphis minnie's. i had the brisket sandwich, my wife and our friend the pork sandwich, and a rib tip appetizer. i liked them all. i probably wouldn't order the brisket again as it is fatty. but the non fatty pieces were good with a good smokey taste. the pork was excellent and the rib tip appetizer smoked to well done with crispy edges. the rolls they use are carved out a bit so you aren't eating a lot of bread and taste good. loved it. also all three sauces at the tables were tasty and they have a hot sauce bottle at the counter to add to the others or have alone that was pretty hot. loved the sauces. i'll be back. the smell alone makes me want more.

I love this place! ?First off, I grew up with sweet tea in my veins. ?Moving out to Cali was prolly good for prolonging when I get diabetes b/c I no longer have to specify if I want it regular or unsweetened. ?The first through maybe 7th times I came here I got the 18 hours smoked Beef Brisket. ?Holy smokes is it smokey. ?I swear I thought I could see smoke coming up in burps for like half a day after eating it. ?Really, all the meats are done amazingly well. ?The sliced pork shoulder and baby backs are moist and tasty. ?All the sides are killer too. ?Bread-crumbed mac-n-cheese, pot-likker greens, corn bread and french fries. ?My only complaint is that their "baked beans" are more like chili than the molasses and bacon fatty ones I grew up with in the South. ?About a year ago they started doing a Southern brunch on weekends too. ?This is a meal not to be missed. ?Low-country shrimp and grits and beef brisket chili hash just to name the ones I can't manage to go beyond b/c they rock so hard. ?Wash it all down with some sweet tea and you are in heaven!

Tasty BBQ (not the best I've had, but still the best I've tried in these parts), GREAT service, AND they have Stella on tap!

I think Yelp reviews should be based on in-city comparisons, hence the four-star rating. I don't think it's quite fair to compare BBQ in a health-conscious state like CA and an even healthier city like San Francisco to (no offense) TX/the South. But Memphis Minnie's is good, for SF. I was a little wary because I'm not a fan of pork and was worried that MM, with a pig as its mascot and Memphis in its name, would only serve pork BBQ. But boy, was I wrong! The menu is diverse, from Andouille sausage (BBQ isn't BBQ without sausage, folks) to chicken to beef brisket to meat by the pound. You aren't allowed to sit before you order but turnover is pretty fast. I would recommend the sweet iced tea - it wasn't too watery or too sweet. I sneaked peeks and what others ordered and the amount of food you get is pretty big for the price. The Boyfriend and I shared the Taster (two or three choices of meat with two sides and a cornbread muffin) and there was no way one person, unless very large or starving, can finish all of that. We had beef brisket, St. Louis cut ribs, Andouille sausage, sweet potatoes and BBQ fries. My favorite was the sausage. The brisket wasn't the best I've had but quite decent. The ribs were tender but a little bland. That's where the sauces come in - ?you have your choice of four sauces: Texas red sauce, mustard sauce, vinegar sauce and hot sauce. The hot sauce is located on the counter directly to the right of the register (from your perspective, not the cashier's). There are little cups in which to pour some in and take back to your seat. I liked mixing the Texas red mixed with the hot sauce. Don't be deceived! The first taste of the sauce is very bland with no kick but give it a bit and it'll hit your mouth. I very much wanted to try the pecan pie but was just too full at the end of the meal. I'll update this review next time with the pie.

This is a 3.5 star place! I will keep it short as first, there is really little if anything ?to say in the negative column. As most who know me, I am a stickler for this being as objective ?as possible. This is one of the few times that I can say that the majority of the good to terrific reviews are accurate and maybe underrated! Everything they have, and I think I have had half the menu at some point, as my other half eats here weekly, and its all superb. I rarely give three stars or ?in this case three and half. I have taken people from out of town and every one of them have revved about the food. As far as my negative reports, ....umm, well still can't think of any. ?i Think they are very ?very good at what they do, and don't know why they have not grown as I would think other locales would gladly welcome a Memphis Minnies. The sides are good and my one tinny criticism if I have to have one is that the fries are ever-so slightly a tiny bit on heavy side of salty. The flavor of fries with garlic and crispiness are great. I don't like boring ?McDonalds=type fries. So I will keep this small. This is one of THE BEST PLACES for barbecue. Price is very reasonable considering what quality of food is, and portions are on the larger side as well.

Since I decided that my yelp moniker would be "estranged southern belle", I thought it only appropriate to write my first review on a TRUE Southern BBQ joint. ?Hailing from Alabama (if you're ever there : Dreamland. You'll never have better ribs.), I'm highly suspect of BBQ places north of the Mason-Dixon line or West of the Mississippi...especially in San Francisco. That said... Memphis Minnie's is amazing. ?Its enitre menu is a refreshing taste of home for any Southerner. ?And it's an honest sample for anyone who isn't willing to travel 3000 miles for the original. ?The first time I wandered in (skeptically), I chatted with the owner. ?*Good sign of hospitality--and boding well for a good meal to come--he is always around the restaurant, checking to make sure his diners are satisfied. ? ? I highly recommend the "melt-in-your-mouth" pulled pork and the tangy cole slaw (vinegar-based, not mayo). ?And if you're not familiar with the 3 different kinds of sauce provided at the table : MIX 'EM! ?All 3 tastes go really well together and you can never have too much sauce! ?Go with banana pudding to finish off the meal. ?The cornbread does tend to be a little dry, but overall I love it, and drop in fairly regularly to remedy both hunger and homesickness.

I do not understand the mixed reviews on this incredible place. It is as good as it gets. My son and I came over from O town on a Sunday afternoon, craving some good Q. We even sat in traffic in the heat for half an hour. It was all worth the trip. We quickly found a parking space on the corner and scooted inside. Our order was immediately taken and we grabbed our seats. We had barely sat down when ?whoosh! Our names were called and I was greeted by 2 chock-full ?combo plates of brisket, ribs, sausage, corn muffin and 2 sets of sides. Yummy! This is what I was born for! The meat was moist, succulent, and smoke flavored. The way meat is meant to be. Unlike some bogus barbecue joynts, the meat it is not hidden under some too sweet sauce. This is the real deal. Each side was something to shout about. I loved the cole slaw, sweet potatoes. As a treat I picked up some deep fried grit sticks, which came with their own special dipping sauce. That could have been a meal itself. They were crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. Wow! ?I was amazed a how great the service was, something a place this size doesn't always emphasize, ?Some other rib place make you wait a half hour just to order, add another half to wait for food, then a further wait for your check. Not so at Minnies. ?Just thinking about this place makes me want to return right now. Drool, drool! Make sure to save room for desert !!

Grabbed lunch here for the first time and was immediately captured by the smell of ?BBQ walking from a block away. ?The place was packed full of people, and was unsure if we were going to nab a table. ?I ordered their Southern Star with a side of Mac and Cheese. ?Standing in line, my friends and I thought we'd have enough time to find an open table. ?If you're eating in, it turns out they won't serve you your food until you've secured a seat. ?Well... something happened where we got our food quickly, to find no available seats. ?Not only were they politely apologetic, they proactively offered us some free food for their error. ?I would've been fine with eating on the curb outside, but the gesture was greatly appreciated. ?Ultimately, they were able to open up some tables for us. ?The food was great, even better when you throw in the additional sauces they have readily available on the tables. ?I definitely plan on revisiting this place!

People who think BBQ needs to be drenched in sauce are amateurs who don't know a damn thing about real barbecue. ?Real barbecue is all about how you cook and dry-season the meat. ?This place has amazing dry-rub barbecue. ?I always get the pulled pork or the ribs, although the brisket is super tender. ?The sauces are awesome and distinctive, although the meat is delicious enough to be eaten by itself (as it should be.) ?The mac and cheese with bread crumbs in it is tasty enough to be its own meal. ?Best tasting BBQ in the city, but 4 stars because it's slightly overpriced. ?(But not enough to stop me from eating there when I'm in the neighborhood.)

"BBQ is like sex, the worst is GOOD" ?That's what one sign says at Memphis Minnies...I thought so too until I came to this craptacular joint! ?I think this place is over rated just because of the lack of southern BBQ foods in San Francisco. ?Let's start with the seating, it sucks. ?The place is small and you may have to share a table with strangers. ?Now for the crappy "BBQ" food. ?My beef rib came over burnt yet the inside was still red. ?A good BBQ rib would have slightly red inside with a nice glazed outside. ? I'm pretty sure they cook the foods after you order it. ?Good BBQ food is always slowly cooked for hour+. ?This give it a nice tender juicy texture that falls off the bone when you bite into it. ?Maybe I'm wrong...maybe they do cook their foods for hours? ?If they do, they sure aren't doing it right. ?My memphis sweet pork cuts were DRY DRY DRY. ?BBQ Chicken was also DRY. ?So now you think...ok it's dry, let's make the most of it by using BBQ sauce. ?WAIT?? ?What BBQ sauce?? ?That's right...Memphis has none. ?They have three other non BBQ sauces which I disliked. ?Good BBQ places that I've gone to have at least 3 different BBQ sauces at the table to choose from. ?Corn muffin is hard to mess up. ?But they messed that up too. ?It was hard and dry. ?Hardly any moisture in it. ?Yup. ?I definately wouldn't go back.

the sides are horrible. yams - negative mac n cheese - negative -- pasty texture, and definitely some kind of seasoning in it that is just a No for mac n cheese greens-- I don't even want to relive the moment I spit it out at the dinner table. mind you I wasn't the only one who did that. I sure hope not all bbq from Memphis taste like this cuz damn, I'm ?never going to eat there ever, but thankfully as far as I know it's just this place. No, this isn't our first time back. We gave it rather a few more tries but it just isn't getting any stars from me or my party. My work does order some of the chicken and beef bbq since they're only a few blocks from us, but I usually skip these lunch days. I'd rather go to the old brother in laws even though it isn't the same, it's way better than this. By the way, the greens at Memphis taste like you're eating them out of a vinegar bottle. Ughh. I asked if they used turkey or pork to make them because I don't eat pork. The guy was like,"Why?" Why are you even selling the greens you do? Horrible. Nice people even though he tried to sell me the biggest sides when I specifically said the smallest size. Nice people but yucky food. FAIL

while the meat was tender enough, the "smoked pork sandwich" wasn't very smoky at all (nor was it even salty enough). ?in fact, the sandwich was so unsmoky that i think it actually sucked any existing smoke OUT OF MY LUNGS to fill in the vacuum where there was supposed to be smoke. ?but perhaps i judge too quickly based on a poor sandwich. ?next time (if there is a next time), i will try some proper barbeque menu items like the brisket or ribs.

I'm very disappointed. This place has a lot of hype, and I just wasn't impressed. I guess I was expecting something like TJ Robinson's Gingerbread House-quality eating experience and it just was a major fail. I split a Memphis Sweet-Smoked Pork, which was adequate, but dry. Sauce helped, but none of the sauces stood out. The Red sauce had a Thai-Vietnamese-Teriyaki taste that was more strange than delicious, the yellow mustard sauce was also underwhelming. Those two were the most tolerable of the four sauces offered, and every time I tried one, I was convinced that the other sauce might redeem itself. And it didn't. So the meat was dry and the sauces were weird/untasty (and thin/runny). We ordered beans and potato salad for the sides, and our plate came with corn bread. The corn bread was good, if not spectacular. The pieces of meat in the beans were a lovely surprise, and the beans were actually pretty good. I'm not a beans person, and I don't generally appreciate beans, but I have to admit they were very flavorful. The potato salad was fine. I had a sweet tea with my meal-- which tasted strangely fermented in a weird way. Nothing I ate here was amazing, and everything was quite pricey. The portion size of the sides are small. I plan on giving this place another try in the future. Maybe their fried chicken sandwich or beef brisket will blow my mind. I hope so. I lied to my bf about how I felt about the place because I didn't want to hurt his feelings. He seemed to enjoy the food very much. The cooks were very friendly, and the waitresses are very young, loud, and flirtatious. Maybe I should come back to this place when I'm not PMS-ing.

I can't say that I ever really tried beef brisket...but when I saw this was #14 on the sf list of 100 things to try before you die, I had to try it. ?Being that my other 1/2 is from the south I figured he'd be a good judge anyhow. ?It was pretty crowded for a weeknight @ 8pm. ?In fact, there was only 1 table left and the line to order was 4 deep but it went quickly. ?I ordered a 2 way plate w/ beef brisket ?& sweet pork. ?With a plate you get ?a cornbread muffin-soo good, and a choice of 2 sides. ?I chose the mac & cheese and southern fries or something like that. ?They call your order for pick up within mins of ordering. ?Everything was REALLY good. ?And the boy thought it was pretty close to the real, authentic thing. ?Next time I'd probably try something else or just order the beef brisket plate. ?I did feel it was a bit pricey - for 2 plates although I ordered a 2 way, and 2 beers = $48. ?

This place is decent and does not live up to the heavy hype. I had the BBQ chicken plate and it wasn't as smokey and juicy as I had hoped. Without the sauces (which I thought were watery), the chicken was dry and tasteless. The corn muffin was also dry and a little hard and the greens were nothing to write home about. I'm not that picky of a BBQ eater and I honestly found it to be just an ok joint.

I ordered a pulled pork sandwich, a staple at BBQ places. Where I'm from in Georgia, this means pork cooked for probably 12-18 hours which is then saturated in barbecue sauce - one should question where pork ends and sauce begins. ?Anyway, I received my sandwich, and it was pork, alright. ? It was served on a deli roll instead of the traditional hamburger bun which I supposed was questionable, but ultimately okay, as I wasn't really there for bread anyway. But it was completely devoid of sauce. ?At first I thought there must have been some sort of mix up in the kitchen, or this was someone's cruel idea of a joke. ?I had to sauce my own sandwich with cold, flavorless, runny BBQ sauce that was sitting in a squeeze bottle on my table. ?And there was a disgusting amount of fat in the sandwich. ?As someone else mentioned, ?properly cooking the pork (slowly and for great duration) will eliminate most of the fat. ?I shouldn't see huge globs of white gunk, nor should there be burnt bits on the meat. ?Let's not even talk about the off-color macaroni and cheese. ? I definitely did not trust this place to cook greens properly. ? Another 'Southern' place in the Bay fails to impress, what else is new.

After hearing and reading such good reviews I was expecting a lot better. My friend and I drove all the way over from Oakland for, what we thought was going to be a special treat. I had the pulled spicy chicken sandwich which had good flavor but it was not warmed all the way through. The mac & cheese was halfway decent. The greens sucked! The corn muffin was too coarse! The sweet potatoes were tasteless. The fried peach pie wasn't very tasty and wasn't heated throughout. My friend had the rib tips and brisket. Some of the rib tips were overcooked and dry. The bbq sauce selection was just strange....I'm not even sure what to say about it. I'm glad they have the Haight street inhabitants fooled into thinking that they know anything about bbq and soulfood. I've traveled all over the country and had all types of bbq. This definitely isn't anyplace I would go back to. I'll stick with the bbq and soulfood that I can find in Oakland and save myself a $4 toll.

Went here after reading my old friend Alexis B.'s review. The cab ride ($25) may have cost as much as the food ($23), but it was well worth the trip. Probably the best BBQ I've had in the city (definitely better than Nate's although I hear great things about the Houston's ribs). Had the tri-tip and ribs, both excellent. Sauces were all good and the mac n cheese was legit. Cornbread was mediocre (as noted elsewhere) but the banana pudding is worth getting if you have room (and maybe even if you don't). Will definitely head back next time I find someone with a car

my husband is from georgia so he comes from a long line of bbq lovers. ?these guys can pull it off. ?we love the brisket and the combo plates. ?the sides are excellent, especially the mac 'n cheese....mmmmm. ? and we love the bbq pork rolls and fried cheese grit sticks. ? the fried peach pie is awesome too. ?oh and they have the real deal: sweet tea! ? had brunch here recently...pain perdue was tasty. ?chicken hash was so-so. ?and yeah, i know. ?it's all soooo not good for you but it's really yummy and they're super friendly there too! ?try the sake! ?and ask about the "bluegrass metal" cd they like to play.

Hole in the Wall BBQ at its finest. Its reputation definitely proceeds itself in most City circles. This is going to be the closest thing to true BBQ that the City has to offer, just expect to pay City prices. The food is good in my opinion but there are better BBQ places throughout the Bay Area (See Big Nates or E&J in Oakland). The cornbread muffins are a little dry if you don't get them fresh from the oven (which is rare). One perks of this place is the variety of sauces you can use to spice up our choices (This is really a true sign of ?a good BBQ joint in more historically significnt BBQ areas of this country). Beware of the Super Hot Sauce though, it will put a hole in the side of your mouth (among creating other problems) if you don't use it sparingly. The biggest problem here is the seating. There really is no room for a large party or any party of more than four people (I really recommend parties of two max). Parking is a problem as well which is why its best to send someone in with the order, circle the block for a few minutes and then take it home. They take credit cards too which always makes things easier.

So far, I've only had an andouille sausage sandwich and the brisket as main dishes on two different occasions and personally I have to say that both were excellent. I actually liked the fact that the brisket was served dry because often barbecue joints dump way too much sauce on the plate to the point were it drowns out the natural smoked meat flavour and/or disguises the inferiority of the meat. Plus, they had a half dozen different styles of homemade sauce (including mustard, vinegar, and a sauce that was is supposed to be insanely hot but didn't really make me tear up until after about 6 tablespoons) on the table that I had fun mixing up different combinations of them on my plate. The brisket was so tender that I had a hard time keeping it on my fork. The mac and cheese and potato salad side dishes are seasoned and prepared with the same dedication as these their succulent, slow cooked barbecue. ?The cornbread was moist and tasty without tasting too sugary like cake. ?My only caveats would be their prices and the small portions of the side dishes; barbecue is historically inexpensive food and after spending about $18 on an entree, two side dishes, and a soft drink, I would at least expect the sides to come in breakfast cereal-size bowls instead of small cups that are more suitable for holding condiments. However, with the love that I've tasted in this food, I am intrigued enough to go back and sample the rest of the menu.

Let me start by saying that the meat is awesome!! ?It's perfectly seasoned and smoked and cooked beautifully - yum!! ?My problem is with the service end of this establishment. ?When you walk in, there is usually some tough guy working the register and he intimidates you into placing your order as quickly as possible (there are about 50 things on the menu, so hold your horses, pal!) ?Once you place your order, time stands still because you want to taste the juicy food you ordered . . . ?and then you wait . . . and you wait some more . . . and then you start thinking that maybe, just maybe, they are slaughtering a cow back there and that's why your order is taking so long. ?Seriously, there are at least a half dozen people working back there, but oh no, don't expect your food right away. ?Even if you are the only person in the restaurant, your food will still take a while. ?This is unacceptable when you are paying $20 for a piece of meat.

My boyfriend and I have been craving BBQ all week and were sorely disappointed with this place. ?They were out of chicken and tri-tip?? ?Maybe it's more of a rib joint so I may be willing to try it for that but it was kinda gross. ?The greens were overly sweet and tart, not my type. ?SO BUMMED. ?The girl taking our order was really nice....that's about it. ?I had the spicy pulled chicken (since that was the only kind of chicken they had) and it wasn't even "pulled" chicken and had some strange creamy sauce--not what I was expecting at all but not terrible. ?Mac n Cheese was not good either. ?My bf had the sausage and was disappointed in the watery BBQ sauces. ?Not sure how this place has earned a name but probably wont return. ?We paid way too much to be this disappointed.

I am so glad that not everyone has been duped into thinking MM is the best BBQ west of the Mississippi. For some reason, all of my friends love this place.

Best BBQ I've had this side of the Midwest. ?Usually get the pulled pork or brisket sandwich, occasionally the ribs. ?The meat is tender and has lots of flavor but I can't help pouring on the red sauce anyway. ?The other sauces go with the meat also, but it seems like they are meant for other dishes, like extra vinegar sauce for your greens. ?The side dishes are alright, more there to round out the meal. ?The prices are a bit high to eat there all the time, otherwise I'd never bother with burgers or burritos again.

I went there for the first time yesterday. I always Yelp food places because, well hell, we eat 3 times a day. Thinking of that place right now makes me hungry. The briscuit was lean(you never see that) the sauces were thin and spicey, mustardy. They have their own style, which is good. Not a copycat, kc masterpiece using place. The guy messed up on my side though, I asked for beans and I got greens. But, still trying to figure what they were about, like a pickled spinich thing, pretty damn good too. The guy behind the counter gave me the full 411 before i ordered, and I would surely return.

All the people who have been giving this place high marks must be smoking crack. I will admit that the brisket is pretty good, but the St. Louis ribs are okay at best and the chicken was bland and dry. The sides were nothing to write home about and the corn bread was chewy (and not in a good way, in an old, stale way.) The worst is the sauce. Thank goodness I had some bottled bbq sauce at home to mask the dryness of the chicken and add a little kick.

Alright, since moving to San Francisco, one of my main food goals has been to find a bbq restaurant that could hold up to what I know as good (half my family is from the south, so I'm pretty damn picky). And, for a while, Memphis Minnies did this for me. The meats are always cooked just right, the sides are excellent, the sauce options let you have some fun, the fries are seasoned well, and even sweet tea!! The first night I attempted this dining establishment, this was my experience: the food was good, the person at the register was kind and answered our questions and even joked around with us (I think he was the owner). I thought I had found my place. But. I went in a couple weeks later, on a Sunday, and had an experience to just knock the good one over. The food was still good, and arrived quickly, but the man at the counter WAS AWFUL. He rushed us through ordering, was rude to every customer in the restaurant, and even put his own staff on edge. There was no pleasant chitchat, but a tense, whispering silence, not only among those working, but hovering over the customers as well. Several people walked out before ordering as a result of his attitude and demeanor. We finished our meals quickly and thought, "hey, maybe he was having a bad night, we'll give it another try next week." And I did, I brought my mother, who was in town visiting, after she had driven four hours or so through stop and go traffic. I thought this would provide us with the cozy atmosphere I remembered from my first night. EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. The same man was working the register, and he was just as bad, if not worse. The situation was so stressful and unpleasant that we ended up leaving before our meals were finished. Several people walked out, mid-meal or before ordering. One group even canceled their orders. I glanced through reviews and didn't see anything similar to my experience, and was wondering if others had encountered this as well. Memphis Minnie's could be a perfectly decent bay area bbq restaurant, but it won't be getting my business until some serious customer service work is done.

good - decent BBQ for SF (I know, that's not saying much... but it's better than having to live in Texas) - my usual is the two-way combo with brisket & St. Louis ribs, with the beans (with nice bits o' meat!) and mac & cheese - you can never go wrong with sweet potato pie for dessert - try the crazy hot sauce bad - the chicken was a little dry - I didn't love the slaw

There was nothing right with this place. ?Just the beer selection, which was acceptable. This falls under the dry bbq category, with the sauces on the table for you to pick. ?So you're thinking ok, this might bring my sorry a$$ ribs back to life. ?Except all the sauces were terrible. ?The mustard sauce tasted like heinz yellow mustard, the vinegar sauce was just straight up vinegar, the tomato based sauce tasted like leftover indian food, and the hot one was way too hot to taste anything else. ?So now you're debating whether dry chewy bland meat is a better bet than the sauce alternative. ?So you try the baked beans, just to find they're undercooked. ?So you go for the hardest thing to mess up, the potato salad, and guess what, those were undercooked too ! $20 bucks for bad food and rude service - congratulations, you made it on the FT List: F*** That. ?Go to Big Nate's, they will hook you up.

As a former resident of the deep South, I can attest to the fact this place is too expensive for what they serve. A brisket plate with two tiny side dishes shouldn't be costing $17, but that must be the protocol for having an eatery in the lower Haight. Wasn't bad but it definitely didn't meet my standards. The raunchy cashier chick was funny, but that didn't make up for the average food. I'll go back if someone else is buying, so basically I probably won't be back.

I'm from Alabama, so I know what good BBQ is all about and this place is as close as you are going to get to real Southern BBQ. ?The atmosphere is perfect, the waiters are really personable, and the room is decorated in cute pig decor. ?Seating is small, so I recommend going at off hours when there is a better chance of getting a table. ?I always get either the BBQ pork platter or the pulled pork sandwich. ?The meat has a great flavor and is cooked really well. ?They have a variety of different BBQ sauces from different regions of the South, so you have a good selection. ?The macaroni and cheese is just about the best I've ever put in my mouth. ?I just wish that the serving was a bit bigger. ?They put it in a very small little cup. ?The fries are really tasty too. ?The one thing that really pushed this place over the edge for me is the fact that I can get very good sweet tea here. ?I can't find any better in California.

happiness is a pile of wood and a pig. that's what the t-shirt ?hanging on the wall says and it's pretty accurate when lunch is served here. but don't forget the beef brisket. tender and juicy and just the right amount of smoke flavor. the pulled pork shoulder that was served to me was way too fatty and just a pile of mess. it was way too difficult to find meat in this pile of fat. big disappointment, since this was a recommended meat dish. the pork ribs were meaty and savory. smoked chicken = too dry. smoked Cajun andouille sausage was tasty. don't bother with the mac and cheese (mushy pasta and not much taste); but do try the Texas beef brisket chili! spicy and good use of the tasty brisket. the deep south sweet potatoes were tasty too. this review needs to mention the three different house BBQ sauces offered. my personal favorite is the Texas red- savory not too sweet or thick and very tasty. the North Carolina vinegar sauce is good especially to cut some of the grease of the bbq meats and the mustard sauce is an acquired taste but good. my favorite decoration was the large bucket of lard can sitting right on top of the Bunn sweet tea beverage dispenser. I was too afraid to ask if they use lard here for any cooking, but it was a pleasant retro artifact either way. JYW says "check it out."

i really can not believe all the positive reviews this place has. ?i mean i am really dumbfounded. ?you have got to be kidding me. 1st of all i do much better BBQ. ?2nd of all i make better corn bread. ?3rd of all are you kidding me????????????? i took the future Mrs. out to the lower haight for some good old fashioned BBQ. ?i used to live in this neighborhood and it was one of those places that was always right there but you never go to, you know what i mean? ?and then your life changes and you are no longer in the neighborhood or the state for that matter, and you put it in the back of your mind and say to yourself i really want to go there. we were very disappointed in the results of my lower-haight fantasies that had been fermenting in the back of my mind since my not so lucid lower haight days. ?acid? OK. wow! but i have now matured and i now have a job and i now pay taxes and acid is now something i use as a cleaner. so i guess my culinary palate has evolved somewhat. ? this place is awful. ?we got a st. louis plate and the ribs were as dry as 4 dollar laundry. ?i was sooooooooooooo disappointed you could not imagine. ?i had the sweet smoked pork sandwich which as you could imagine was dry and bland. ?both of us were flabbergasted. ?the BBQ was so dry it was criminal. ?i really wanted a a BBQ place i could call my home away from home but this is not it. ?in terms of BBQ i have had the privilege of growing up on a little place by the name of Emil villa's. ?now way back then before they sold the joint they smoked those fucking ribs right there in front of you and when you ordered ribs they pulled them right out of the "hick'ry pit." ?which is what the restaurant was called. ? this wasn't my first attempt at finding BBQ in the city and it wont be my last attempt. ?however i will not go here again. ?i have yet to find one worth mentioning but when i do i will write about it. now i must say this the 1 saving grace of this place was the collared greens. ?damn fine. ?some of the best Ive had. ?other than that, id leave it alone. ?and i really mean that. ?2 stars is generous.

This Bar b Que is super expensive! $35 plus dollars for small portions of meat (chicken, sausage, brisket); three small sides (cole slaw, beans, sweet potatoes) and ONE corn bread! The meat was very bland; however it was tender! The sides were not so good either. The beans had no seasoning; the sweet potatoes were hard and were NOT sweet--what happened to southern type of sweet potatoes that are usually SWEET. And ONE cornbread! I couldn't get over this one "ONE" piece of cornbread for a meal that was supposed to serve up to 3 people! ?One look at the cole slaw, and I decided not to even try it! It didn't look too good. Besides the unappealing food, the customer service was not so good either. I stood and waited while they chatted with another customer who had already ate. The finally took my order! This was not very professional even for a place of business that is a dive! I won't be going back

after reading a review from yelp...i decided to visit here with a friend. ?the place is easy to spot b/c it's painted in red. ?when we went inside....i was little bit taken back....and almost walked out. ?the place is tiny and it's down right hole in the wall. me being from atlanta, i've been to some hole in the wall places but this place beats them all. ?i stayed and ordered brisket sandwich with mac & cheese and my friend ordered brisket sandwich with french fries. ?the sandwich was a good sized and it was actually very good. ?the brisket was sliced and not chopped so i was happy with the style (some places are chopped even in atlanta). ?flavor was definitely there (smokey but not over powering). ?there are 4 sauces and i tried all of them. ?if u like vinagar base sauces u will like it. ?i just don't like vinagar base. ?there was a spicy one that i liked but it really burns ur tongue so be careful. ?the mac & cheese? hmmm....comes in a little cup ?and it looks horrible visually. ?it's very runny. ?but once u take a bite to it....it wasn't bad. ?it wasn't excellent by any means but it was good. ?my friend's seasoned french fries was better way to go. ?it was very good. ? overall, i enjoyed my experience there. ?it was good food and it was cheap...$24 for 2 brisket sandwich with one side each and two soft drinks...not bad. ?would i go back there? hell yeah!!!

If you are like me, you probably will go ANYWHERE for great BBQ and know how bad the Bay Area is for this. ?When I recently visited Dallas I was made aware of this even more. ?Texas BBQ rocks, Bay Area is fish country. ?That said, the next best thing is Bob Cantor's place Memphis Minnies. ?Everything is very, very good and the sides and his house made deserts are fantastic. ?Especially the sweet potato pie, not in a mini tin but a big slice (like grandma's pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving) with homemade whipped cream. ?The best BBQ I have had in California is not a place of business but the street vendors in Santa Maria that park along Broadway. ?If you drive down Hwy 101 on a weekend, swing into Santa Maria and check this out. ?The red oak really flavors the meat and is something special. ?If you are not in the mid state area, visit Bob Cantor at Memphis Minnies. ?BTW his Weekend Brunch is VERY southern and rich, but really, really good!
