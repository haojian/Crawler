I came here on a weekday night after happy hour and my friend told me they served dim sum from 9pm-12am. I looked at him like he was crazy. Dim sum is brunch food and I've only had it on the weekends around noon. So you can sense my skepticism upon walking in. First shocker - he was right. Second shocker- the dim sum isn't half bad! We came around 8:45pm and I asked if they had dim sum. This loud Chinese man ( might be the manager) told us to take a seat and wait until 9. We saw the menu and its 3 dim sum dishes for $10. The selection of course isn't as big as it would be if it was served at a normal hour but it had all the popular items on it such as dumplings and shu mai. We ordered $40 worth of dim sum between the 4 of us which is more than enough. I won't butcher the spelling of these dishes but I thought the best dish was the Shrimp dumpling (har-gaw?). Note: you can't order one dish and expect it to be $3 bucks - it'll be $4.25 for an individual dish so it's a better value to do the 3 for $10 deal.

This review is for the late night dim sum after 9pm. The restaurant was fairly busy. Most of the tables were taken except for about 5. We were seated right away. We asked for the dim sum and unfortunately/fortunately it is a menu. ?"Unfortunately" because there are no ladies walking around with the dim sum carts which is part of the fun of eating dim sum. My dim sum girllll. "Fortunately" because the food is made fresh to order. We ordered the shrimp balls, xiu mai, shrimp and chives ball, crunchy shrimp ball, taro ball, tofu pork, and a few other dishes. All of the food was pretty good and the service was friendly. The crunchy shrimp ball was a little off. It was too chewy and hard to eat. I especially liked the taro ball and Shrimp/chives ball. Seems like all of the workers spoke good English compared to other dim sum restaurants in San Jose. M-F after 9pm. 3 of these dishes for $10. Good deal! Will definitely be coming back!

Fu Lam Mum is a good and legitimate Chinese restaurant. ?Prices are a little bit on the high side, yet reasonable for an upper middle class restaurant. ?The Chinese food is legitimate and tastes good. ?The servers speak and understand English. ?Feel free to eat here. ?I recommend it. My gf wanted to eat Dim Sum. ?One word: ?delicious. ?We wanted to eat more. ?We were stuffed. ?I recommend the Chinese broccoli or Kai-lan. ?There is a small selection of dishes available from the kitchen during Dim Sum. ?We ordered the Beef Chow Fun. ?It was fantastic. ?It wasn't too oily. ?Plenty of portions of beef. ?The Beef Chow Fun was legitimate. ?I said legitimate too much.

It's 11pm and you're suddenly craving dim sum. Fret no more, because Fu Lam Mum has late-night dim sum. hehe Just like any HK restaurants here, don't expect to get anything beyond decent service. The place is popular and always busy even late at night. Their late-night dim sum is such a steal - 3 for $10! If you're not too hungry and just craving dim sum, then 3 orders would feed 2-3 people just right. I personally really like their: - pumpkin porridge - soy sauce fried noodles - tofu skin with pork Our total bill came up to $12 before tax and tip. Haha! How amazing is that.

I like this place.They have all the dim sum all day round! I mean I love DIM SUM! It is not the best dim sum out there, but for the pricing and convenient of location is superb! The place is always crowd, which makes the service lacking a bit and the servers quite slow. The ambiance isn't anything fancy, a typical Chinese restaurant setting. If you want to dress up this is not your place. The place is spacious like others has mention, but if you get put on the second floor, then the service and food doesn't get to you immediately.

My friends chose this dimsum place and I decided to tag along. Located on Castro, I didn't expect too much from such an established dim sum place. When I walked in, my first impression was that this place is really spacious and didn't feel like one of those grimey dim sum places. The wait was quite short and we were seated upstairs after a short amount of time. I ordered the mushroom with crab and shrimp, shui mai, tripe, hai gow, chicken feet, bean curd, fried been curd with shrimp, and fried shrimp balls. They were all good and the fried dim sums were all pretty fresh. The dimsum here isn't as oily as your typical dim sum, but the tradeoff was the price. The service here was surprisingly quick especially since we we were on the top floor all the way in the back.

We get catered food from Fu Lam Mum at work sometimes and those are always the most exciting work days! Yum yum yum. I came to the restaurant for the first time in a while and I was pleasantly surprised at how friendly the staff is! It's different from your typical dim sum experience where it is difficult to communicate with the wait staff unless you speak Cantonese. Most of the staff knows enough English that they can tell you the names of the dishes that they have and actually be helpful to diners. The restaurant is pretty big, it gets crowded for dim sum but the wait for 4 of us wasn't too bad. We got seated upstairs, and even though it's a slightly smaller space, there are still enough dim sum carts with enough variety that you'll probably get most of the things that you wanted. We had to flag down a waitress to ask for some things (sesame balls!) and they brought it over eventually, but it just took a while. The carts come around pretty frequently though. The food is good, but nothing stood out to me as particularly amazing. Definitely a good dim sum experience overall!

I can't comment too much on the restaurant itself, but I do handle corporate catering at my office and regularly order from Fu Lam Mum. Working with Ben is a breeze. My office provides dinner to our employees four days a week. I started placing catering orders for every other Monday night. Our employees liked the food so much I ended up changing it to every Monday. They very reliable, quick to respond to emails, very accommodating to changes and always on time. The food is always fresh and they provide plenty of variety. I'm a big fan of their Dim Sum and my favorite dishes are the BBQ pork and shrimp fried rice. I am also completely addicted to the sesame balls!!!

I came here on a weeknight only because it seemed to be the only place open after 10PM. It sorta looks like a cafeteria from the inside and the service is horrendeous! A woman walked up to our table (no eye contact) and placed our dishes for us. Next, another woman who brought us the menus.. 2 different ones which was very confusing. Then another woman plopped a metallic pot of tea on our table. When we went to pour the tea for ourselves, we realized that the bottom of the pot was leaking.. We ended up ordering the eggplant dish, which was stir fried eggplant WITH pieces of chicken in it! There was NO mention of chicken in the menu. Our other dish, the Singaporean noodles, was super dry and looked as though it was prepared a few days ago. When we were finished (we barely touched our food and we were starving), we had to wait around for 15 minutes before we were able to flag someone down and get our bill ..and the place wasn't even that busy! The next morning I was nauseous.

I came for Sunday lunch dim sum at 12:30pm, and I only had to wait 5 min for a table even though the restaurant was packed. Plenty of carts came around with lots of options. Our party of 4 got the shrimp and pork in mushrooms, tripe, shrimp dumplings, chicken feet, bean curd, siu mai, fried bean curd with shrimp, and fried shrimp balls. The bill came out to be about $45 so the price was pretty reasonable. The food was pretty good, but nothing particularly stood out. My favorite is still the fried bean curd with shrimp. Fu Lam Mum also caters at my company every once in a while, and I always look forward to it! There is so much more variety as opposed to when I go to the restaurant itself. The last time they catered, they brought steamed bbq pork buns, chicken buns, pork dumplings, bbq pork, rice, and vegetables. All were good but not outstanding.

Fu Lam Mum is the only dim sum restaurant I've ever been to. I don't have anything to compare it to, but I can say that I've loved everything I've eaten here. Tips: Come with a group and share the plates Order off the carts (trust me, it's fun) Trust that whatever you're eating will be good (if it weren't for my Chinese co-worker I'd be screwed ?- theres a bit of a language barrier) Nightly dim sum happy hour! Don't feel bad to tell them no more food (they'll seriously just keep bringing it out. It's so good but at some point you just have to say noooo) Group of 7 had lunch for under $80. Legit.

I've come here for both morning dim sum and night dim sum. The food is standard dim sum, a bit expensive compared to other places I've been to in the San Jose area. The real killer of the review is the service. It's very inconsistent, given how it's just carts. Three out of four visits, the majority of the carts ignored my table, even as I called for them. Given we were in the middle of the aisle, we were almost guaranteed a poor selection. Sometimes the cart will go out of their way to reach the table behind you. It's stupid really, if you want to make money don't ignore your customers.

This was one of those places that had decided to stay open on Christmas so my family and I came here for dim sum. We had a reservation so we didn't really have to wait for a table. I like the fact that there's an upstairs and a downstairs. It allowed them to seat more people for quicker service. And I like the fact that they fry the pan fried turnip cake in front of you so you know it's fresh and hot when you get it. Overall, the food here was good. It wasn't exceptionally amazing, but it was decent for the price. Service was fast, too. The waiter kept refilling our teapots and such.

We only have 1 day off in a week and our choice of place to dine for Chinese food has always been Fu Lam Mum! Either its cravings for dim sum or authentic Chinese food, this place is our 1st choice! Those who know me knows I hate driving far for food (yes, Mt. View is considered far to me) but I'd burn some gas to come here with my folks. They never seem to disappoint me wether its the service, cleanliness, quality and quantity of food, prices, atmosphere for a Chinese restaurant actually exceeds my expectations etc. I don't seem to have any complaints about them... When my relatives came to visit me from Arizona, I took them here, loved it! My son's 1st bday, we threw a big party here for him and everyone enjoyed it! If I had to say something about them, I've always been curious to see what the upstairs look like since we have never been up there but that's really not a complaint. They also open late, serves dim sum late too and is around the corner from clubbing at Zen, lol! Their lobster is fresh and made yummy! They let us see our choice of live lobster and saut¨¦ed it in our custom preference, spicy garlic and salt and peper, yum yum yum!

Food selection is slightly more than Saigon Seafood in Sunnyvale but I think it's overpriced for their menu. Saigon is more reasonably priced. Service is better but if you sit inside or at back, by the time the food carts arrives, your selection is limited and your favorite food are all gone.

Rule #1: if you plan to have lunch here on a Friday, make sure to get here before 11:30 am. ?Anytime after will be a headache because there will be NO PARKING anywhere. ?We planned our team lunch event here on a Friday and we arrived on Castro St. at around 12:00 and it was parking hell. ?We had probably gone through the 3 main parking areas and were unlucky in each (don't go to the parking structure at this time or else you'll be stuck in there forever without being successful). ?We had finally found parking about 8 blocks away from Fu Lam Mum in a residential area, but it was worth the walk. ?Why? Read below... Upon walking into the restaurant, your initial reaction would be how nice the restaurant is. ?Through experience, most dim sum restaurants aren't clean but considering this one was located on Castro I guess it will be kept clean. ?We were seated within 5 minutes of arriving and within 30 seconds of sitting we had already 5 different dishes on our table. ?I won't be able to name all of the dishes we ordered but I'll try my best to name or describe some of my favorites and what I would recommend if you decide to dine here. 1. My favorite is tough to describe as I don't exactly know what type of veggies were in it, but I know it had shrimp in it with some green veggies and when you order the dish, they fry the dim sum in front of you with this mobile grill. ?Very good!!! 2. Mushroom stuffed with shrimp paste 3. Pork shumai...i think that's what it is called 4. Fried shrimp balls - it was covered with these won-ton looking strips which gave it that extra crisp 5. Pork buns 6. Sesame balls stuffed with some red bean paste We also tried the chicken feet and some jellyfish dish which I tried, for the sake of saying I tried them, but probably wouldn't order it next time without the company of my team as they were big time fans of it. I will be back here, but before the 12 pm rush!!!

Dim sum here is pretty decent. Good selection on the weekends and the carts usually come around fully stocked. Everything is fresh and well prepared. Service is typical for a chinese restaurant. If I am lucky, some of the cart ladies speak vietnamese which helps me out since they tend to be nicer. Gets crazy on weekends after 11.. so if you come after be prepared to wait.

Dim sum is good, had it at lunch on a Friday. It was crowded so we were seated upstairs but the second floor filled in quickly so we weren't the only ones up there. The staff brought dim sum carts up via elevator. Regular Chinese dinner was also tasty. I actually went in to get dim sum not realizing they don't serve it at night. Food came out fast but it was a little hard to flag someone down for the bill/water since they were cleaning up tables to prepare for the next day.

Mmm dim sum :) Fu Lam Mum is probably one of the better places to go to in the South Bay for dim sum. It definitely gets insanely crowded during the weekends, so come early! Or expect a line. I'm also a big fan of their post 9 p.m. deal-- $10 for three dishes! What a gem. Anyways, quality food at a quality pace. I get the Shao Mai, Xia Chang Feng, Chao Feng, Pai Gu, and more! Pretty much any regular dim sum item you get is basically fine.

Made my first visit today and I was not impressed. The ladies serving dim sum were nice, hence the two stars. The wait staff stayed on one side of the restaurant so trying to get people to come by to take away empty plates and refill the teapot was minimal. ?Food was bland and very limited. The eggplant with shrimp was undercooked and the only thing my group could taste was the sauce. The rest of the dishes were not memorable. I will not be coming back.

The worst chinese food I have ever had. Also, the worst dinner I've ever had on Castro street. The mapo tofu was bland and actually just consisted of blocks of tofu floating around in a watery, tasteless sauce. The orange chicken had a very artificial-looking neon orange sheen and was soggy. The fried rice was overly greasy and flaky with no real meat or veggies in it. If you are thinking of going to this place, you should go to Hunan Chili across the street. Their food is amazing!

I ate here few times during lunch. Dim sum is on average side. Nothing special, but it works for lunch. What is different in Fu Lam Mum, is waitress who uses restroom and without washing hands goes to main floor to serve Dim Sum. How do I know this? I was washing my hands when it happened. I approached manager of Fu Lam Mum and described him what I saw; I did not gave away waitress with dirty hands. ?He promised that this will not happen again. But how you can be sure? After witnessing waitress-not-washing-hands-after-restroom situation, I decided to skip on Fu Lam Mum and go to different place for lunch.

Very tasty and well seasoned dim sum. This place is empty at 11:30am but suddenly becomes jam packed at 12 noon sharp. ?I thought it was really high quality that they would grill the taro cakes and chive dumplings on a hot grill so it's surface is nice and crispy. All the dim sum dishes were very tasty. The only they can work on was the chicken feet which had a couple of bone chips in it so whoever chopped it didn't do a nice clean job of severing the bone. They also don't have the sweet rice pudding cake called bok tong go, minus a star for not having this dessert staple.

Fu Lam Mum was our caterer for our wedding. ?It was the first time they've catered at our wedding venue and the overall experience was perfecto. ?Our venue and caterer must have worked really well together because I didn't hear any complaints. ?It might have even set a precedent for those looking to have a traditional Chinese banquet at a winery! ? Our venue allowed our caterer to utilize their kitchen in order to serve a fresh 9 course Chinese banquet dinner. ?For our cocktail hour we had a self-serve dim sum station readily on hot steaming trays. ?As a bride I was pretty busy, but from the looks of it people went back for more servings and made a plate full of shrimp dumplings, steam bbq pork buns, veggie potstickers, steam veggie dumplings, shrimp & pork dumplings. ? I've eaten here before for dim sum and dinner and when we learned that they catered we were ecstatic. ?It made our family and friends really happy. ?I didn't eat much during dinner, but from my observation Fu Lam Mum is a professional team. ?They had all the paper work needed to get the job done and provided exceptional food. ?Our guests raved about the sea bass. ?They loved it. ? Each course was served in a timely manner. ?The chef even made small portions of each course on small plates for our sweetheart table. ? It's definitely a challenge to find great Chinese food to cater and our overall experience with them was fantastic. ?Our family was expecting American food, but they were so happy to eat crab, sea bass, etc while overlooking twinkling lights of silicon valley. ?I'm going back here for dinner to make up for my lost meal.

Our family experienced food poisoning after getting dim sum here around 12:40PM, December 31 2012. We ordered: Chrysanthemum tea, steamed pork rib, xiao long bao, congee with preserved egg, shrimp chang fung, and leek and shrimp fried dumpling. The symptoms began almost exactly 12 hours later; I threw up just after 1AM, my brother and mother shortly followed. This was followed by approximately 12-18 hours of chills, slight fever, cramps, and frequent diarrhea. The symptoms abated gradually afterwards. My mom's symptoms were lightest; she's allergic to shrimp and avoided the shrimp dishes, which leads me to suspect that is the cause. The consistent timing of the symptoms and the fact that our dinner guests (an occasion from which my mom was absent) were fine further pinpoints lunch as the source of the poisoning. I have dined at Fu Lam Mum several times over the years and this is the first time I have experienced food poisoning there... or anywhere else inside the US. I hope Fu Lam Mum uses this information to find the source of the problem and fix it ASAP.

Tried out Fu Lam Mum again recently for dinner. Just as I've experienced multiple times with their dim sum, the food here is authentically Cantonese (the servers even speak it), but also averagely so. This is after trying a variety of classic Cantonese dishes for dinner (roast duck, fried squid, vegetables, noodles, fried rice, etc.) with a large group that generally echoed my views. The redeeming quality is that, of all the Chinese places in downtown Mountain View, it is reasonably dependable, great for groups, large, spacious, well-maintained, and open fairly late. Also, the good part about the relatively average flavors is that there was no discernible excess in terms of saltiness, greasiness, or MSG, as you can clearly tell after dining at lower-quality Chinese places.

This place is fairly average. Came here for lunch on a Sunday. We arrived around 12:30 and there was a pretty big group of people waiting outside the door. Luckily, the wait wasn't too bad, around 20 minutes for our party of 4 to get seated. Order everything you want from a cart at one time as the same cart doesn't really seem to come around to the same table again and it's a big hassle to try to flag these people down. I was especially disappointed with the porridge, they were pretty skimpy on the ingredients. Very little pork and preserved egg. LAME. The pieces that were in there were pretty small too which resulted in lack of flavor for the whole dish. The rest of our meal consisted of the usual dim sum stuff (ha gao, cha siu bao, shu mai, lotus sticky rice, luo buo gao) which were all pretty good. Pretty cool how this place is open late, I wouldn't mind coming back to try out their late night menu.

This is a dim sum review! I love dim sum and I have been to many highly recommended dim sum restaurants in the Bay Area. Fu Lam Mum is one of them that I am very satisfied with. The dim sum taste good, and in addition to that, they are tidy and well presented, which I really appreciate. I recommend the tau fu fah(beancurd jelly) for dessert, very well made, smooth and silky. I do not like things too sweet so I ask for less syrup. The price here is not bad at all, around $15 per person will make you really full! I go to Fu Lam Mum on the weekends for breakfast, it normally gets more crowded around 11 in the morning. Nothing really blew my mind but this is a legit dim sum place and I would come back anytime.

I've been here a few other times since my last review here, and I have to say this place is still below average compared to other dim sum places around the area. Every single time, I try to keep an open mind and give the shrimp dumplings another chance, but each time they have failed me. Either the skin is too thick and overcooked, or it's too sticky and falls apart. Very disappointing. Also, their jook (porridge) is bland and super skimpy on the ingredients inside of it. There's just a few pieces of fried wonton on top, with tiny diced pieces of the hard boiled egg inside. And there's not a lot of flavor to it. Very unimpressive. The only reason that I'd come to this place is because of it's location in downtown Mountain View, which is walking distance from where we live. But if it wasn't for that, I would have no reason to ever return here.

Sometimes I just need some dim sum. I got seated pretty quickly considering it was jammed with a lunch crowd. Don't they know I really need the dim sum? The dim sum carts cycle by quickly. I select my favorite shrimp dumplings and start shoveling. They were large and good. More carts go by. She says "jelly fish and seaweed?" Ummm no thanks. Next is scallop and shrimp dumplings. I also liked this combination. More carts go by. "Seaweed and jellyfish" she says again. I say, "No thanks." I'm thinking she is not going to give up on the jelly and seaweed. Next pan fried shrimp dumplings. Not my favorite. Oh oh here comes the jelly lady again. I look out the window and have a Larry David moment. "Jellyfish and Seaweed?" ?She gives me a big smile. No thanks? She leaves. Whew! Now for the mini custard pies.

I've come many times over the years. This was the first time that both the food and service was super sub-par. Food is usually 3-4 stars (depending on what you order). Service is usually a "2" (hey, it's a Chinese restaurant). This time service was a 0, and food a 2.

Fu Lam Mum + 30 hungry interns = absolute circus. Fully aware that every steaming plate would be on the company tab, I won't exaggerate when I say we ordered EVERYTHING. Between several fans of all things dim sum (myself included), several picky eaters with their own favorites (dan tat! ha gao!), and a few terrified dim sum virgins, our communication with the cart ladies quickly dissolved into a sort of incomprehensible shouting/pointing (which isn't too different from Cantonese in general, I suppose). Needless to say, we ate until we were stuffed. They had a really interesting dessert that I've never seen anywhere else: three crisp green tea balls filled with a sweet matcha paste, like sesame balls only less oily. I'm a fan! Overall, a perfectly acceptable choice for dim sum... even without an unlimited budget. :)

This review is about service. Worst service ever. Grew up in a Chinese family and I can say with confidence that I have never had a worse service at a Chinese restaurant. Don't get me wrong -- the food was average. If it weren't for the service I would have given it two stars instead. Never book a large party with this restaurant. The waitresses gave the worst attitudes possible. I booked an event for about 70 people, and they were not hospitable at all. At most restaurants if you have a big party, they'd do the best to serve you well. Not this one. Minutes after sitting down at our table, we asked for the menu, and it took them 15 minutes between that and asking them at least twice more if we can see the menu. Every time we asked, they would mumble something and keep walking, as if it were an insult. The last time we asked a different waitress and she shouted 'okay!!!' back at us as if we were bothering her. The food came out in the expected time, so I wouldnt say anything about the chefs or the restaurant, but the waitresses (yes, they are all middle-aged females). I made the orders for our table, and as the independent college students we are, some of us would order something else small on the side after I made the orders. After every input, the waitress would look at me and basically scold me and shout every order back at me (trust me I've had my fair share of Asian restaurants, and I'm only okay with my mom scolding me) and I'm just sitting there thinking 'okay thats what we want actually so it's fine'. Of course, we never saw her again for the rest of the meal. I was okay with this, because it just meant they're not getting a good tip, if any at all. And anyone who's had a large party should know that getting 70 people out takes nothing short of a few minutes. We were all sat down on one wall of the restaurant, so it shouldn't have been that big of a bother. But as we were squeezing our way out of the one aisle we were all stuck in, I heard the most disrespectful, bad-mannered "EXCUSE ME!" that I would expect from, say, a four-year-old trying to get the attention of everyone in the toy aisle at Wal-mart, from one of the waitresses trying to make her way through. Obviously, customer service comes before customer care. This review is not about the food -- THE FOOD IS GREAT. But I don't know if it's because we didn't order in Chinese or because we were young and therefore automatically deemed 'inconsiderate and irresponsible', but they treated us all like kids. We're full paying customers, and deserve the respect a basic customer should have.

Went here very late in the night about 11pm. It was super packed and the waiter somehow forgot about our order, therefore we waited about 50 minutes before the food came. Every other table that walked in after us were served. By the time our food came, the restaurant was closing and the workers were getting ready to go home. We felt rushed and did not get a chance to enjoy the meal. Good customer service would be to give us a discount for forgetting to put in our ticket order in the kitchen. Lemon Chicken is pretty sad. Battered chicken and weak sauce on the side, that's the excuse for Lemon Chicken?

After being intentionally ignored by St Stephens Irish Pub down the street, this is one of the very few places still serving food at 10 pm on a Sunday. ?It was packed. . .with Asians and a smattering of white people. ?Good sign, from my experience. ?We were enthusiastically greeted as we walked in the door and promptly seated next to the "ocean view" (lobster tank, crawfish tank, etc.). This place is HUGE! ?Not only is the ground floor expansive, but they also have an upstairs! ?Decor is not fancy, but it's clean. ?Every worker in the place is constantly moving. ? The dim sum menu is 3 for $10 after 9 pm. ?We ordered the shrimp/cilantro/bamboo steamed dumplings and the chicken and pumpkin porridge. ?Mmmmm mmm, both were perfection! ?I could have been full on that, but as I am a pig when presented with an array of delicious options, I also ordered kung pao chicken. ?Too many red and green bell peppers, but otherwise perfect! ?Bf ordered crispy lemon chicken which was two massive pounded breasts pounded thin, breaded lightly, and served with sweet lemon sauce. ?Good! ?To end it, we ordered sesame balls with lotus paste. ?Omg. ?This entire meal was around $45 or so and provided us with much more satisfaction and happiness than any other bay area dinner we have had in the past couple of weeks. ?I wish I could go back tonight, but alas, we will not return to Mountain View until next summer. ?Something to look forward to! By the way, they were open till midnight on a Sunday! ?Check their hours, but pretty sure they are open even later on weekends.

This is my favorite Chinese restaurant! I have a great experience every time I go. My favorite dish is the house special sauce over fried rice which I order every visit. All the dishes I've ever ordered here have been absolutely delicious, so you can't go wrong. I typically go for dinner, but their dim sum lunches are pretty good too. And the service is pretty good, which is surprising for a Chinese restaurant. ;o) The manager (maybe the owner, I'm not sure) is there most nights, and he's always patrolling the floor, making sure the customers are happy. I've had my birthday dinner here twice, and it was excellent both times. The first year I held it there, they provided our party with complimentary mango pudding dessert shaped into fish. Loved it. The second year we brought our own birthday cake, and they took care of cutting it for us. Another thing that was great is when we had a large table, they were able to customize the size of our orders for us so we could order dishes that were about half a size larger to accommodate our party instead of having to order 2 separate full-sized dishes.

Went here for lunch last week for the first (AND LAST) time. ?Ordered the shrimp dumplings and pork buns. ?I ate two of the shrimp, which were pretty good and one of the pork buns. ?Everything seemed just fine until I got to the second pork bun. ?I broke it open to find a very large hair right in the middle of the bun. ?I was so grossed out and called one of the people who work there over. ?I told her and showed her what I found and her response was "o.k., so are you done with the shrimp?". ?Um, what?? ?My response was "well I haven't searched them for hairs yet!". ? She called another guy over and I showed him what I found. ?He said he was sorry and I high tailed it out of there as fast as I could. ?Felt sick to my stomach the rest of the afternoon and will try to erase the image from my memory. Totally unacceptable.

Named after the most famous HongKong (HK) restaurant, known to be "wealthy men's cafe" as a local legend in HK. ?It has one of the most best reviewed Cantonese food in HK. This place resemble nothing like the HK legend except the pricey tag. Over priced Cantonese food. The food is only so-so, but cost more than usual. For example, the Cantonese traditional "steam fish on bass" suppose to have a very tender, soft but fishy taste on meat found on the fish's face, but it's somewhat rough. As A real Cantonese eating "steam fish" all my life, I can tell you even a kid can steam better, except this one cost $30 !! I wouldn't recommend this one except you really want overprice fish, or you are willing to eat sub-standard Cantonese food! Their dessert which suppose to cook with all the ingredients, but instead mix heavily with water. ?I gave 3/10 at best for that. Come to my house, I can show you how to cook better Cantonese food ! If you think the food here is authentic, and like it? Man, your taste need to be upgraded...

Came here for a last-minute Father's Day dinner. It was my first time here and the decor was unimpressive -- kinda old/dirty looking. BBQ Pork: actually very good. there wasnt too much fat and the sauce was good Chicken Pot: It was so greasy and salty -- i could only eat a few bites Deep Fried Tofu with Veggies: once again -- very plain and just salty Vegetables with Garlic: tasted fine My real complaint: we ordered and then got the BBQ Pork about 10 mins after ordering. We finished that and waited for the rest of our food. 20 mins later...we didnt wanna rush them cuz the restaurant was a little busy. When we had been waiting for about 45 mins, we finally told them to check on our dishes. Within a span of 10 minutes, 3 different waiters came up to our table and said "sorry your food is coming very soon"..10 mins after that, our 3 other dishes arrived one by one. I think they just totally forgot to make our food. A waste of time, and the food wasnt even good.

Review is for dum sum only. We came here for lunch on a Friday, and it was decently packed at noon, but there were still tables available (mostly upstairs). We were able to grab a table downstairs, which was better since there seemed to be more dim sum cart action. We had the standard Har Gow (Shrimp Dumplings), Shiu Mai (Pork Dumplings), and Har Cheurng (Shrimp Flat Noodle). The pork dumpling was the best, and the shrimp flat noodle and dumplings were also good. The Fried Shrimp Balls were surprisingly good, but on the oily side. The Fried Taro Dumpling was too bland and needed more salt, and the Fried Meat Dumpling was good but barely had any filling. I didn't like the Pan Fried Chive and Shrimp Dumpling since the skin was too thick, and the Bean Curd Roll was so so (on the bland side). The Chinese Hot Mustard was on the watery side, which was a negative. However, I really liked their Green Tea Black Sesame Balls for dessert. Service was ok, but you have to flag down the servers to get something. Overall, this is a good spot to go for dim sum, but there are better places in the South Bay (but also pricier) like Joy Luck Palace and ABC. Since Fu Lam Mum is located on Castro street, parking can be tough, but they have a parking lot right behind their restaurant.

Came here for dim sum Saturday morning, expecting a good meal since this place had pretty positive reviews...but alas that was not to be. First off, the hostess is a biatch. What's with the attitude? You're in the customer service industry, you should learn some customer service skills. She basically just gave us the stamp card and motioned us towards the stairs and curtly/rudely added "go up there." It wasn't that busy at 11 am, take your time to greet your customers at least. Her service was made up for by the servers and ladies pushing carts, who were friendly, nice, and efficient. The food was just average. My favorite was the pai gwat (spare ribs). I wasn't impressed by the usual fair, shu mai and shrimp in rice paper were decent. The green onion pancake was cold and a bit hard, probably from sitting out too long. This is a good place for large parties. Will probably give this place another shot, maybe for dinner next time.

I had the Salt & Pepper Fish from the dinner menu here recently - it was delicious; based on that I'd have given this place 5 stars. Then, yesterday I ordered the Spicy Fish Fillet for to-go, it is in the lunch specials (but Fu Lam Mum allows ordering them after 9pm). Unfortunately, the dish was around 50% fish fillets ... and 50% tofu!! I thought this was some oversight, and called up just now to inform them - turns out that yes, their *fish* fillet is supposed to have tofu in it. Have to dock more than 1 star for such a deceptive labeling, and also the dish itself was 'ok' but nothing great, unlike the salt n pepper one I had earlier. Its still good value for their lunch & dinner specials imho, just make sure to confirm that huge chunks of tofu are not part of your 'fish' order.

I have eaten there many times over the years, probably go about every month or two. I'm not sure why the other reviewers are so tough on it, but in fairness we usually order from the lunch/night menu and only occasionally have Dim Sum. It's true that the restaurant has some pricier dishes but when you order the late-night menu (as we usually do) you are paying the same as other local Chinese restaurants and I find the quality a notch higher. The decor is quite nice and the service is usually very quick. It's true that some of the servers speak little English which may sound like they are being impolite. I've honestly rarely had a bad dish there, though of course some are better than others.

Waitress had a "I'm better than you" attitude. ?She made us feel like we were too poor to afford their prices - which were amongst the highest for Chinese food. One of the dishes they brought us was different than what we ordered - and it tasted mediocre. Went there a second time - to give them a second chance. ?It was over priced and over rated. ?I rather eat at Amarin Thai food across the street. ?Not coming back here again.

The only time we go here is if we're eating with a bunch of relatives, or if my dad is craving some oily canto food. Its extremely average. I was never too impressed. I can't say much about this place, because it is what it is. Your typical canto/chinese restaurant. I enjoy their salty fish fried rice, but it's hard to do that wrong. I haven't tried out their late night stuff or dim sum, but honestly from what I've had here, I don't think i'd be particularly impressed with it anyways.

Thank God that they were not too crowded and we were able to get a table for a party of 7 at the last-minute on a Sat. evening. Meeting friend and her family from out of town during the holidays and we originally planned on meeting at Chef Chu's in Los Altos. Silly me who forgot to make dinner reservation so 15 minutes before we were supposed to meet them there I had to scramble to find a restaurant that was close to Mountain View and that were available to seat all of us. Called Ming's in Palo Alto and they also were fully booked for that night. Then it just occurred to me Fu Lam Mum has a lot of tables and with a 2nd level they might have an open table for us. So I called and they did not disappoint! For that I upgraded their ratings to four! We ordered seafood soup, walnut prawns, fish filet in black bean sauce, minced shrimp in letteus cups, chow mein and egg rolls. Everything was light and good.

This place has a special place in my heart. Living apart from my girlfriend, I'd usually arrive into town late on a Friday night. We would routinely eat here for late night dim sum. They have a great dim sum deal after 9pm, 3 dishes for $10 and I really enjoyed most of it. Maybe it was the joy of seeing each other that made the food taste so delicious, but I'm a fan. Fair warning, I grew up on very Americanized Chinese food, so I can't speak to the authenticity of the food, but I certainly enjoy it. I've had non-dim sum once and it was okay, nothing special. The service seems pretty typical for many large Chinese restaurants that I've been to. They are relatively quick to take your order, bring the food out with no particular pattern or order and are extremely curt, but get the job done. A routinely interesting experience was trying to order a drink from their full bar. The late night servers don't typically understand English enough for alcohol orders so they would usually need to bring over a group of people and still manage to bring the wrong order. These weren't complicated orders (gin and tonic, whiskey and coke, etc). It was more endearing than frustrating. Drink roulette was almost as exciting the dim sum.

Less than 5 minute wait on Sunday morning = WIN! But overall, just A-OK. We were craving dim sum and were lured in by their more than affordable peking duck... - Shui Mai (shrimp and pork dumpings); 3stars - Hai gow (shrimp dumplings); 3stars - Radish cake; 2.5stars - Shrimp Rice Roll; 3stars - Chicken feet; 4stars... however this was my first time eating chicken feet. It always scared me before... but I went for it and it was so good! take it how you'd like - Spare ribs; 3.5stars... also a first - Gai Lan; 2.5stars - Vegetable Chow Fun; 2stars - Peking Duck; 2stars The Peking Duck was lots of fat and oil and bones; they did not prepare it well. It was ok I guess for what you paid, but I would avoid making a habit out of it here for the sake of your health. But overall, a nice convenient dim sum spot for when you're craving... wouldn't mind it again if I was in the area.

I'm no dim sum expert, but I thought the food here was A-OK. I was here with only one other person (who does not speak Chinese--first time going to a dim sum place without a Chinese-speaking person! x_x) so I didn't get to try too much of it, so I'm not ruling out that perhaps this place is just not as as good at making the dishes that I like, know knows. We had the typical popular stuff, cha siu bao, ha gao, and a couple other varieties with the sticky rice wrapper that ha gao has. There was this veggie dumpling that we got at the very end that was probably the winner for best item during our meal. Everything tasted fresh but nothing so~ amazing. If there was anything wrong I could pinpoint, I thought that the flavor of the lotus wrapped sticky rice was a little..off. But like I said, perhaps that's just my preference, since I don't know much about dim sum. I did notice that this place is spacious, and even during the busiest dim sum time (noon on a Sunday), I did not see too many people waiting for a table. I've had better, but after spending months in the East Coast with even more mediocre dim sum (and a lack of Asian food in general), I enjoyed this meal.

The staff are friendly, and the ambience is OK. What makes this place a stinker is the terrible food. The food is terrible because it has given me an upset stomach on two occasions, and finally food poisoning on the third. Anyone who has ever had the 24-hour flu, you know what I am talking about when I say "food poisoning." Even if you are luckier than I am and dodge that bullet, their non-dim-sum food is surprisingly bad and way too oily. Their dim-sum is never fresh and always has thick skins and a cloying taste. Avoid this place. It is open late, but you are far better off buying something from Safeway.

TLDR: ?The closest dim sum place to us, it meets the requirements of your typical chinese HK seafood restaurant that serves dim sum but doesn't exceed them. Food: ?They have the typical fare on carts. ?You can always count on the har gow, xiu mai, xialongbao, fat noodles, jook, dessert cart at any time they are open but the less common dishes (yu hsiang egg plant, etc.) may or may not be there on any given visit. Ambience: ?Its pretty typical -- the air of once being fancy but having been neglected to the point its a little shabby. ?One wall has live seafood in slightly grimy tanks that entertain the kids. Kid-friendliness: ?High chairs. Thats it. ?Oh, and since its a Chinese retaurant and fairly large its really loud so no worries if your kids are loud and noisy. ?Our kids love dim sum so it doesn't really matter. ?However, if your kids like ours drink ice water, need straws, forks, etc., remember it takes a while to flag down someone to get them for you since the default is tea and chopsticks. Parking: ?Its on Castro -- it adjoins a lot behind but it can get busy during peak and then there's street parking. Busyness: This place fills up fast. ?If you get there prior to 11 am no line but 11 am until about 1 pm can require a wait (though often not super long). ?We tend to avoid peak so I can't say exactly how bad it gets. ?But note that if you go super early or later the food variety can suffer (see food above).

I seriously love this place so much that once, I came here four days in a row. More recently, I visited once for morning dim sum and then came again for 9 PM Happy Hour. So yes, this place is awesome. Aside from being incredibly cheap, clean, and sanitary, they are super convenient. ?They are open super late. ?A parking garage is right across the street. ?And because this place is a huge two stories, I never have to wait for a table, no matter what time I arrive. Service is always great as far as dim sum goes. ?Aside from the fast seating: the carts come by quite frequently; staff is happy to tell what special weekend dim sum selections are available; tea and water refills are consistent; to-go boxes are brought out without request; drop off and pick up of the check is quick. ?Overall, no frills service, but fast and attentive. For dinner, the peking and roast duck options are fabulous. ?Sososo delicious. ?I pretty much stick with these two dishes and don't venture too far out of my element. For late night dim sum (3 choices for $9), I stick with: crispy sesame balls with lotus paste, crispy green tea balls with sesame paste, and steamed egg custard buns. ?Avoid the thousand layers cake (very chewy and spongey) and the malaysian style sponge cake (very meaty and thick). ?Yeah, those are all sweets... what of it??? For dim sum purists, they may not like that the steamer baskets are both plastic and bamboo. Some of the best dim sum dishes are only available on weekends, such as silky tofu or pumpkin porridge. ?But considering that the weekday selection still has sticky rice (my fav!), it's still better than most. ? Anyway, I'll continue to frequent this place. ?Love it and can't wait to go back. ?Writing this review made my hungry!

Not many places you can get late night food in Mountain View it seems, so this place is awesome! 3 dim sum items for $10 dollar special is where it's at. ?I didn't get anything that wasn't good on the menu. ?It's a little pricy, but no better alternatives. ?The chili here seems a little different than other chinese restaurants. ?It's a little thicker, very good.

Fu Lam Meh. ?Actually, "meh" is kind of being generous. ?The service actually wasn't bad - the servers here aren't cranky and pushy, which is practically a prerequisite at any other dim sum restaurant. ?But still that doesn't excuse serving dim sum that is cold. ?It's not like we got there near the end of lunch either - we arrived at 11:45 so they have no excuse. ?For the prices they're charging, at the very least the dishes should be warm, but half the dishes we ordered didn't even meet that standard. Really, they gave me no reason to come back.

While visiting my brother-in-law we happened upon this restaurant because it was large enough inside to accommodate our party of six easily and without a second of wait. I have to admit, I would not have picked this restaurant as the first place to eat while visiting California, but it was pouring outside and it had seats available! ?We had a party of six and our table sat each one of us nicely with room to spare. Our table had a lazy-susan which was awesome because each of us ordered a different dish and we all got to share! I did have a moment of horror when I realized I was given chopsticks and not a fork to use. I could have asked for one but I felt that this was the best time to figure out how to use the chopsticks and I was glad I did! We ordered a bunch of items but I mainly stuck to noodles, rice and soup as I am a vegetarian. I belly was full and happy when we left, so all was well!

I'm embarrassed I took a good friend here tonight. ?I had previously really enjoyed the dim sum, so I figured the other food must be fine, too. ?Oops. Service was okay, ambiance is fine. ?But we could have easily had much tastier dishes at half the price. ?About the only thing I can say in the food's favor was the portion sizes. The mu shu pork was flavorful enough, but the pancakes were thin and... just seemed off. ?Not even an hour into the meal, the remaining pancake was was like an uber-thin burrito shell that had been sitting in the fridge for 2 days: brittle and tough. And the satay beef? ?Small and sparse bits of beef swimming in a massive vat of vermicelli with mostly flavorless pineapple pieces and little else. ?What was "satay" about this?! The tea was okay; not the worst I've had, far from the best. And hey, not even fortune cookies with the bill? ?Yeah, yeah, I know we're not in China, but still...

I like coming to Fu Lam Mum on Sunday mornings for brunch. It seems like the dim sum is not as greasy or oily as what you'd get elsewhere, which I appreciate. The variety of dishes you can order is a bit limited, but the food is good (if not stellar). The standout here are the BBQ pork buns, totally delicious! Even though it's super crowded, seating has never been an issue, and service is alright. I didn't feel like the staff was particularly attentive, but our tea pot was refilled constantly, which is much appreciated. It's a solid choice in the area for dim sum, but nothing to write home about.

I really wanted to like this restaurant. ?Friendly staff, great location, high ceilings, bright, pretty nice decor for a Chinese place that isn't PF Changs (I don't like their food), etc. ?Unfortunately the food is GREASY GREASY GREASY. ?Too much oil. ?The vegetarian Chinese broccoli was so oily it was heavier than eating meat. ?The dim sum was also a bit flavorless. ?And the meat inside my leaf-wrapped sticky rice had some mysterious charcoaled bits, possibly from an inadequately cleaned wok or cookware. ?But only in one of them out of the 3. ?Odd. They have fish tanks with (alive I hope?) seafood on the north wall and a second floor with seating, although I'm not sure how often they open it up and make it available up there as I sat downstairs. Owner is super friendly and jovial. ?Like Santa Claus. ?But Chinese.

This is a nice dim sum place with nice, modern high ceilings. Like most dim sum places, the service is severely lacking. During the busy lunch hour, you basically have to fight tooth and nail for any attention from a server. The dim sum is decent, but not the best I've had. Their egg custard tarts are small and were not too fresh. The size of the chicken feet they serve makes me wonder if they're using freakish genetically mutated chickens because they were huge! They were really good though. Side order of noodles was so dry we couldn't even eat it. The cheung fan was delicious, but I can't give you many points for that. If your cheung fan isn't good, well, you've done something seriously wrong. Bao zhe were small and also a little dry. Peking duck was good, but not amazing. They left too much fat on under the skin and so it wasn't as crispy as I like it to be. However, $17 for a whole peking duck is a damn good deal. I'll say it again it's A DAMN GOOD DEAL PEOPLE!! It comes with the plum sauce, scallions, and a ton of buns as well. I will probably come back for this reason and this reason alone.

Yay for late night dim sum! My common sense told me not to order, but I couldn't resist the temptation. It's not very good dim sum, but to be fair, I didn't expect it to be. The pan-fried chives and shrimp dumplings were greasy, the taro cakes were luke-warm, and the preserved egg/pork porridge was old. The stand-out was the glutinous rice - it was fairly good and was stuffed with goodies. i'll be back to try the other dim sum. Maybe the shrimp dumplings will be good? Can't wait till hunger strikes me again!

When I visit Mountain View, there's usually only one place I go with my buddies for dinner, HK Bistro. In the mood for something new however, so we finally decided to try the joint next door, Fu Lam Mum. We ordered the salt and pepper pork chops, sweet and sour pork, and saut¨¦ed snap peas to share. The pork chops were nce fried with very little fat and bones and the sweet and sour pork had a lot of flavor. The snap peas were kind of single note, with just a hint of garlic, and was the only dish we had as leftovers. Service was ok but we deteriorated once the restaurant got busy and we sat without tea for some time. The quality is definitely better than next door and the higher prices reflect that. I'd come back to try their dimsum in the future and it's good to know there's a good alternative to the norm next door of HK Bistro. Food: 7/10 Service: 6/10 Price: $$ Atmosphere: 7/10

I think this place deserves a solid 4-star. Recommended by a bunch of friends from Stanford who have been regulars here for years. Nice decor, awesome price, good dim sum (other dishes were pretty good too but I can't remember the names), and easy parking if you know there's a parking lot at the back of the building. The best part is the 3 dim sum dishes for $9 deal (the chicken feet was amazing!). Also tried the wonton noodle soup but it wasn't too impressive. It's a perfect spot for late night cravings and I'll visit again next time I'm in the neighborhood.

Dim sum is one of my most favorite things in the world. ?Fu Lam Mum is pretty authentic. ?Do not believe that it has a sister restaurant in Newark because that one sucks and is nothing like this one! ?

4 stars for late night dim sum! ?Available every night at 9pm! It's not amaaaaazing (for that, go to Great Eastern on Jackson St in SF), but it really hits the spot some nights. ?Rice porridge with preserved duck egg, pan fried shrimp and chive dumplings, and fried glutenous rice puff stuffed with meat (my favorite!)... and for $10/3 dishes is a great deal! ?Going with a friend is even better because you can get a wide variety of dishes for $20! ?I also enjoy the meat wrapped in tofu skin, and the sticky rice in lotus leaf is quite nice. ?Yumyum. It's nice to know if I'm working late in the office any of these nights, I can get some inexpensive late night dim sum for dinner.

I've only eaten here for lunch, and only gotten Dim Sum. (Well, we did order the tea-smoked half-duck once. *delicious*.) Dim Sum was good, served hot. Nothing was "oh my good, I'm having an orgasm" or "I need to throw up". Good food, typical Dim Sum ambiance, and the place was clean. I had to laugh at the "the service wasn't very good" comments. Seriously, it's an Asian restaurant (i.e., expect bad service - it's a cultural thing) AND it's a Dim Sum place (expect to be ignored).

Why would I bother to go on a diet right before Chinese New Year, when my dad will be making some bomb-diggity braised pork, three-cup chicken, steamed fish and all that sweet neon pink and white sugar balls? So why not go to Fu Lam Mum for their late night dim sum and pig out some more, I'm already going to be fat anyway. And that is exactly what I did, and let me tell you, I do not regret that one bit! The price for late night is decent, considering the food was made fresh, and not one of those to-go dim sum bakeries. ?The assortment of shrimp dumplings (some with chives, some with bamboo shoot, etc) were full with delicious shrimp meat - no skimping here! ?The pan fried chive buns (even though we ordered steamed ones) were a bit greasy, but tasty nonetheless, especially with that crispy, golden brown exterior. My one gripe about the the dim sum is that the sticky skin outside of shrimp dumplings were simply too sticky and a quite bland (but maybe the skin was supposed to be bland). ?The dumplings were sticking everywhere and were difficult to be picked up if you are not a master at chopsticking. We also ordered their salt and pepper shrimp from the late night menu. ?For about $9, it was a decent amount of crispy shrimp. ?We were quite shrimped out, you see... Love how I found a dcent late night dim sum place. ?I'll deal with my jiggly thighs later... after Chinese New Year.

Solid, average dim sum at an affordable and reasonable price (lunch came out to be $15 for each of us, after tax), without the unreasonable waits (15 minutes when arriving around 1:30pm). We ended up getting (not being Cantonese, I'm sticking with the English names/descriptions) shrimp dumplings, shrimp & leek dumplings, leek potstickers, turnip cake, BBQ pork puff pastry, shrimp rice noodle rolls, and BBQ pork. All the dishes were reasonably tasty, with nothing standing out too much (good or bad) from anything else. I was, however, slightly disappointed with the puff pastry, with it being my standard across dim sum places, as the puff pastry itself lacked the buttery flaky goodness I'm used to. While not something I'd specifically drive down from SF for (though, driving time included, I might still be seated faster here!), it's certainly a restaurant I'd consider meeting up with South Bay friends at in the future.

Occasion: Dinner with the fambam What I Had: Hot and sour soup Food Review: The hot and sour soup was fine, I'm not too judgmental when it comes to my hot and sour soups. Service Review: Service wasn't so great! Our waitress was very unfriendly and we had to flag her down several times for ice waters, utensils, and our check. We had actually originally come for dimsum, but she was a bit snappish in informing us that we had not arrived during their dimsum hours and so could not have any. ? Venue Review: The restaurant has high ceilings and plenty of large roundtables, so they have the space to accommodate for large parties and big family dinners. Overall Impression: The food was fine, the venue was average, and the service wasn't so great, so unfortunately I think I have to give this one a "2: Meh, I've experienced better."

THEY SERVED US RAW BEEF! on Tuesday 10/4/11 the bf and I decided to take a 1 1/2drive to come here and eat because from what he can recall, he believed this was the dimsum spot he liked the most (boy was he wrong), and since we both some recall much about this place we decided to go anyways. well, we should've just stayed our asses home or have gone somewhere else! They stop having dimsum at 2:30, we got here around 1:40 and they were still seating people at around 2:10. we got what we wanted, the food was only good, not great and not too busy. BUT! the service was horrible! I still can't believe they gave us an under cooked item (i forgot to take a picture) and proceeded to tell me off. 1. My bf ordered pepsi and they brought out sprite. Then proceeded to get mad at us and insisted that this is what we ordered. Because we just didn't take it and actually corrected them, that was when they decided to tell us that they only had coke, so it was either take the sprite or make them dump it out and get coke...and you know what we did, which of course didn't make them too happy 2. Every time we asked for a refill on our coke they gave us this irritated look like "REALLY?! seriously?! again?!"...... well if you didn't fill the glass up with ice and literally gave us like 4 sips worth of coke than we wouldn't have to ask you for refills often. 3. When we got the shrimp rice noodles we asked if they also had beef, the lady told us it was in the kitchen cooking and they'll bring us a plate later. 5 minutes later a plate of what seems to be half way cooked beef wrapped in mushy white noodles with a splash of soy came out. We both took a piece, ate it, and immediately knew something was wrong. When I told our waiter that this plate wasn't cooked all the way and the beef was still kinda raw, he proceeded to tell me in a very irritated and loud manner that "IT'S DONE! AND NO MATTER HOW LONG IT WAS COOKED FOR, THE BEEF WILL STILL BE PINK".. what was even nicer was when this lady pushing the cart near by decided to come and join in the conversation. she insisted that whatever they marinated the beef in, when cooked, is going to be pink. LOOK! i know how cooked beef looks like and I know what it tastes like. I know what raw beef tastes like and i also know what undercooked beef tasted like. What you people served me was uncooked pink beef wrapped in also what is undercooked noodles. I swear you act like I wouldn't know or something.. 4. After sitting and waiting awhile for someone to walk by our table and after multiple of tries to get someones attention, I just got up and walked to the counter to have our bill be processed, only to have a waitress walk up and snatch the bill out of my hand and say "I TAKE CARE OF THAT" then give us our bill 5 minutes later. I love food, but I also care how I'm being treated. If the food tastes good but the service is extremely bad I leave with a nasty taste in my mouth not to mention the taste of RAW BEEF! NEVER AGAIN! avoid this place it's not worth it to pay what you pay to have the same quality if not better somewhere else.

Decided to eat here during a trip back home to San Jose from Ikea. The time was about 10:00. The bald waiter with glasses seemed a little uptight, especially when we asked him for more napkins and 2 iced waters... was not very friendly. The black duck egg porridge that we order was not very good, very unappealing--I could seriously make it better. The snow pea leaves with garlic was the most expensive... $15 for something so simple; it was lacking the garlicky taste that I love. The House Special Chow Mein was nothing special at all. It costs $12, but was very poorly made. The noodles were very dry; we each sampled it and that was it. We should have stuck with the dim sum, which is much easier to satisfy and seemed much more worth it. The flaky taro pork was good as were the chicken feet and pork ribs. After our meal, my sister asked the manager if they provide dessert after each meal. He politely said that normally, at night, they do not serve dessert, but since she asked him for it, he could not refuse. I figured that he was the manager because he was very polite in the way he greeted, the way he paid attention to each table's requests, and the way he talks. Two Stars for him! Overall, some of the food is good... it's a hit-or-miss kind of deal. His workers seemed very moody, and it totally shows. It's just nice that this place opens late.

Went here the other day for dim sum and left very satisfied! They have a good variety, and they always have the classics (pork buns, shaomai, long rice noodles with shrimp, etc). ?They also have awesome custard buns and taro buns. ?Great for dessert. For a meal for nine people (granted there were three kids), the tab came out to about 120 dollars. ?So I'd say that's reasonably priced. One thing to note: it was definitely southern style dimsum, not northern style. ? It also gets really crowded on the weekend, so make a reservation!

My gf and I usually come here for the Peking Duck. ?On Tuesdays and Thursday, a WHOLE peking duck is only $15! The duck skin is crispy, but it is a bit on the greasy side. ?Not that I mind that a lot. ?You will get your typical steamed buns, onions, and hoisin sauce (no cucumbers) which are all just fine. ?The last time we went, we also ordered the crispy skin pork belly, which is ALSO really fatty and really weighed me down at the end of the night. ?Had that feeling of gorging myself on McDonalds; A not-so-pleasant heaviness. Despite all that, the quality of the food is pretty sharp and genuine, having tried many different dishes from noodles to meats to dim sum. This may be worth the drive for the cheap peking duck, and quality chinese in Mountain View, but similar good chinese can be found in Cupertino or Milpitas, etc.

The place is huge and even has a 2nd floor. Fancy! I don't see myself coming here other than for their late night specials. It's quite pricey. Also, the food wasn't anything super spectacular.

This restaurant reminds me of those filmy restaurants often showcased in bollywood movies. Huge, grandeur and round tables await you. The food is above average. Minus two stars because I have visited this place only once and not sure if I came out becoming a fan. The service could have been slightly better.

Ahh, FINALLY. ?Had dinner here for the first time since it re-located down the main street a few years ago, to a larger, more open space with a two-story high ceiling. Don't know why I waited this long. ?Well, maybe I do. ?You know that feeling of apprehension, when your favourite hole in the wall does so well it expands or moves to a higher traffic location... and the food subsequently takes a nosedive? ?It happens so often. ?Fear de-motivated me. ?I wanted my food memories of the restaurant to stay intact. ?Kind of stupid, huh? That's how I felt about trying the fancy new Fu Lam Mum. Happy to report that my idiotic fears are unwarranted. ?Service was a little slow, but things are just as tasty as before. ?Maybe even more so. Pot stickers were excellent. ?But I have to say, they are sort of spooky. ?Perfectly formed-- almost too perfectly. ?Not homey-looking like at other Chinese take-outs. ?Round-ish. ?It's like they started out life training to be dim sum, but someone changed their destiny to pot sticker. ?And ended up in my tummy. ?What an unfortunate demise. Anyway, the kuo teh are plump with pork filling, nice crusty chewy wrapper, not super greasy. ?All Chinese food is rather greasy, but these weren't too much so. Beef chow fun had lots of bean sprouts and onion. ?They could have thrown in more beef. ?Noodles were good. ?Again, not too greasy for what it was. If you can, try these two items from the big red menu's Chef specialties page: ?saut¨¦ed flounder with eggplant; tofu with preserved and other vegetables. ?I was expecting a whole fish, but they actually sliced the filet and some of the outer bony parts into pieces, lightly battered and deep fried everything. ?That way you can eat the crunchy little bones and all. ?Calcium = good for you. ?The fish rested on two-three-inch lengths of perfectly trimmed sliced saut¨¦ed eggplant. ?Delicious. Tofu entr¨¦e was just as hella yum. ?Large lovely cubes of firm tofu, mega mushrooms (baby portabellas?), a few slices of green and red pepper, and wood ear mushrooms all sauteed in a light brown sauce. ?Fab. ?Vegetarian heaven right there that carnivores like me totally appreciate, too. If you want to save money and can hold out until European time for dinner, 9:00 is the magic hour, when dim sum plus 'lunch' specials are on. ?$10 gets your choice of three dim sum items. ?Lunch specials have lots of choices too and include soup (and rice, I think). The upstairs has more seating but it wasn't in use. ?Probably opened up for weekend dim sum and/or banquet events. ?You feel really exposed in this massive very open dining room. My only dilemma now that my food anxiety is resolved: ?wardrobe. ?:/ ?I couldn't really wander in dressed like a super slob anymore, could I? ?Well I can and did, but I just feel even more embarrassed because glass walls and windows and tanks full of stacked live crabs and other seafood surround diners. ?Now, everyone on the street as well as critters I might gobble up can look in and see the horror that is my hobo-ness. ?Can I deal with this? ?So I need to actually dress decent to go to Fu Lam Mum? ?Okay yeah.. grow up. ?It was just.. so much easier to hide at the old restaurant where there was just the window in front and a big fish tank centered behind it, mostly blocking looky-loos. ?But it's alright. ?I will manage. The great thing is: ?the quality of the food remains. So GO forth, eat at Fu Lam Mum. ?It's still Fu Lam YUM. Ah yes... there's the eyeroll. ?And the groaning, and the tomatoes. ?Thanks, and don't worry, I won't be here all night. :D

I'd never been here before and my friend Susan made me take a half day off recently and we ended up here at 12:45pm for DIM SUM. ?Or should I say, YUM YUM DIM SUM YUM. Packed, lots of Asian folks, we were settled upstairs and the dim sum carts started rolling. ?We had lots of veggie options, taro steamed balls, spinach shumai, Chinese broccoli, yum yum yum. Moderately neutral service. ?Nice enough, not overly attentive. I'll come back for a regular meal time dining experience.

Came here for dim sum and for dinner. ?Dim sum satisfies my craving, but it's not the best I've had and it was a bit expensive. For dinner, we ordered tofu with scallops (extremely salty), pea sprouts with salted egg yolk and thousand year old egg (delicious!), pork chop (I didn't eat it, but half the plate was untouched), honey walnut prawns (soggy), and roasted pork (I didn't eat it, but everyone seemed to love it). ?They ended our meal with free mango pudding. ?Yum. ? It took forever for them to give us the bill. The plates of chow mein and fried rice looks huge...maybe next time I come back, I'll try one of those.

DISCRIMINATION: These events occurred on 15JAN2012 at about 1800 hrs. My friend Al, his girlfriend, and I were in the mood for Chinese food, so we took a chance on this restaurant. I was immediately taken by the size of this place. There is a second floor which is blocked off for special events. The first floor has a lot of seating, mostly round tables, to accommodate a huge crowd. This is where things took a turn. . . . We were only the fifth table there; the place was still empty. After we placed our order, we relaxed, ate their peanuts, and drank their tea. People that were seated after us were already served their food. I kindly asked the waitress to see what the hold-up was with our order. Still . . . the place was almost filled at half-capacity and our food did not arrive. Our waitress continued to walk by and ignore us while we watched other people sit and eat. We wasted nearly a half-an-hour sitting there. Unfortunately, this restaurant treats you different if you are not Chinese. If you aren't Chinese, your money is no good here, and you are not welcomed. We ended up leaving and going to Tong Soon Garden in Santa Clara instead. It's a much smaller restaurant, but at least they don't discriminate.

While Fu Lam Mum isn't the best Chinese restaurant in the area, it's convenience, consistency and their solid dim sum is definitely making them more and more attractive. We returned for a quick weekend dim sum lunch and found the items to be all well made, piping hot and lots of variety. The wait never seems to be too long (compared to popular and admittedly better dim sum places like Hong Kong Saigon or Koi Palace) and the food quality is much better than the weaker places in the Peninsula (Ming's, Cho's Mandarin). ?Their prices are also par for the course and more affordable than Tai Pan, which I also like. ? Overall, Fu Lam Mum, especially for dim sum, does many things well and has no weakness or service issues that plague other establishments. Plus Fu Lam Mum accepts credit cards, including American Express.

This review is for a catering we had with this restaurant. ?The boss is very nice but not very legal in terms of providing paperwork for the catering service we received. ?Needless to say, we didn't get what we wanted and I can see why the paperwork was not used as he put it, "trust me we've done this many times we know what we are doing". ?WRONG. ?They ruined a very important catering service I needed and I won't get into the specifics but it's one of those occasions where it's the biggest day of your life. ?We were served cold food, and we swear but we have no proof that our booze was stolen from our party. ?AVOID for catering!

Fun atmosphere, friendly staff, very tasty food, great deals, superb location and a very authentic experience overall. Went one week with a friend from Taiwan and a local who suggested it, we all loved it. Took friends back the next week. Who needs a menu when you can see everything yourself? * Get a reservation and keep an open mind.

I've been here for both dim sum and dinner. Dinner was ok, food was pretty good for mountain view but the staff were just meh. There were like 4 or 5 kids two tables down who kept running around and jumping up and down near the fish tanks. Neither the waiters nor their parents told them to sit down. They could have bumped into one of the waiters and had something spilled on them. It has happened before during one of my family dinners. A kid was running around and bumped into a waiter who had a bowl of hot soup, which spilled onto the kid. When I came here for dim sum with my friend, the service was horrible. After we got ha gao and siu mai (which weren't that good) they pretty much ignored us. They didn't have that many selections, they were pushing the same 4 or 5 carts the whole time. One time the carts stopped next to our table but the lady pushing it and one of the waiter were standing there talking, ignoring us. After about a minute or two, the lady backed up the cart and left it on the side. Wtf. So I guess they don't want us eating here. Most of the people eating here were White, we should have taken that as a sign.

Uggghh....I'm SO full. Came for dim sum today; ate, went home, took a nap, hung out, and am still pretty damn full. ?This is partially my fault, since I allow myself to gorge and eat, eat ,eat when trying new restaurants. The fams and I decided to stop in and check out FLM instead of our usual dim sum place (Mayflower). Overall we agreed that the food was slightly better at FLM. The service was pretty good too; everyone was nice to us and understood everything we said and asked for (none of the nod & smile game you normally get at dim sum places). XLBs - ?LOVE. My favorite thing to order at dim sum. Did not disappoint here. BBQ Pork Bun/BBQ Pork Noodle/Baked BBQ Pork Bun: Standard, tasty Sesame Balls: I wanted the lotus variety, but it seems they didnt have any today. Waah. Red bean paste was standard. Octopus: This was a hit and was ordered three more times. Seaweed: Another favorite Beef Chow Fun: Damn good, and not oily Shrimp stuffed Mushrooms - another favorite Pork dumplings - Meh. Will pass on ordering this again Custard Pies - standard Shrimp Siu Mai and Har Gow - above average, slightly better than other places Will likely come back.....parking lot is convenient; across the street behind the businesses. Four stars for dim sum goodness!

I will admit that not being Asian I was pretty intimidated by this place. At the risk of offending everyone, there are not a lot of white people who eat here. However, I'm so glad that I finally gave it a shot! We arrived for a late dinner about 9:30pm and the four of us were seated right away. The dim sum is a great deal so we ordered a bunch of those (all I remember are the pork buns because they were so tasty I think that's all I ate - also I don't like shrimp) and then I had some of the beef on crispy noodles and chinese broccoli with chicken that our table shared. I thought the food was good, 4 stars definitely. However, the service was really bad. Considering how not crowded the restaurant was I was disappointed when we ran out of water and couldn't find our waitress, wanted to order some more sticky buns and couldn't find our waitress, when we wanted the check and couldn't find our waitress....you get the picture. I've heard that the weekend dim sum is fantastic, so I'm sad I never got to experience that and maybe that's what they do best. Dinner was just ok.

Downtown Mountain View is a great place to dine late night. Restaurants like Fu Lam are open pretty late on the weekends. My fiance and I came here after a few rounds of Mai Tai's, so our choice of food wasn't a good one. We didn't really know what to order so we just randomly chose a fried rice dish which was the Yang Chow Fried Rice. It tasted exactly what you would eat if going to a wedding that was catered at a Chinese restaurant. The rice was dry and tasteless. The mini shrimps were probably the best part of the dish but it was limited. We saw most people order the dim sum. It would been a much wiser choice than the fried rice. Something I will definitely try next time.

This is a 3.5star place, but I am rounding up I do love me some dimsum, and this is the best place I have found in the Mountain View area. ?Back in LA, when you go to get dimsum, you end up waiting for an hour trying to get a table, or you get your grandma to go with you (like me) who knows people and gets you a table immediately. ?But other than that, the wait is ridiculous and its always super crowded. ?But here, the restaurant is deceptively large inside and the dimsum carts come around like clockwork - no waving down people to get stuff. ? I came here once with my family and once with my classmates. ?When i came with my classmates, it was saturday afternoon at like 2pm. ?I was skeptical because most dim sum places stop serving around 1pm, or they stop making new things and are trying to get rid of what they have left. ?But to my surprise, they had everything we wanted, and more. ?Actually, the hardest thing to get was a refill on our waters. ?The only downside about this restaurant is that its a little on the pricey side for dim sum, at least compared to what I am used to. ?Overall it is not the best dim-sum i have ever had, but it is the best place i have found in the area so far.

I have to tell you the real story why the S.O. and I came here for dinner and it was PURELY out of desperation. Thanks to "Transformers 3" and it's 3 hours of crappy dialog for killing our dinner plans! It was 9:30 pm and everything in PA was closed. CRAP! Desperate measures calls for desperate Yelp Search key words. "Open Late, Restaurants" and boom, we were on our way here. We passed by it and it was packed and happening. A good sign. BUT we should have been prepared for such occurrences... for they sat us at the back, like way back, next to where their utensils/plates where stationed. ? Got seated next to a creepy old White guy trying to seduce an Asian woman that could barely speak any English. Folks, I can't stress enough how disgusting that man was and that whole scene... Sad, anything for a green card and then some.... Oh boy, we were in for a long evening. We ordered... it says their specialty was "dim sum" but we didn't get any dim sum menu but only their regular menu. I ended up getting my go-to dinner: BBQ pork fried rice and the S.O. being a coconut, got sweet and sour and potstickers. Folks, this is by far the longest and slowest Chinese place I've ever been and believe me, my best friends are Chinese and I've been to restaurants that they don't speak any English and the food comes out before you even get a first sip of your tea! We arrived at 9:45 pm and I got my fried rice at 10:30 = WOW. Did they have to harvest the rice and kill the pig for my BBQ? Really? It came out and it tasted like any other fried rice I've got and it wasn't any better!? S.O. hardly ate his sweet and sour b/c he said it wasn't crispy and had a funny chewy taste... And that's why I don't order that dish! We got the tab... paid and yes, we didn't leave any tip! Yes, they didn't deserve any since we hardly got any attention and yes, I know it's a Chinese place and yes I know service is usually straight forward but this time around, they just suck. We got our water at the very end, we had the servers asses as our view every time they would get their plates and such and where was our dim sum menu!? Yes, it was purely out of desperation and lesson learned. But they're open past 9:30... a plus? Go to In and Out! Your stomach and patience will thank me!

Love, love, love this place! It's two floors so you can always get a table and the servers are constantly parading around with great dim sum. Sure they don't speak a lick of English but they can recognize a "chopstick point" well enough. Usually the poor communication would knock off a star but the price point of the food compensates. The food is good. I wasn't raised around dim sum so I'm not sure if they're authentic but I like what they serve and I feel full and happy when I leave.

Came here for a quick dim sum lunch. No wait, very big place overall. The service was pretty good for a Chinese restaurant I might say. ?Got seated, drinks and food all in less than 5 minutes. Only complaint was the food wasn't hot hot, like it should be coming from a dim sum cart. So the food might have tasted more fresh and better if it was. Overall, I won't go out of my way, but if I was near by and wanted Chinese breakfast, I'll be back.

A great place for late night (9-12pm...but arrive by 11:30pm or they won't take your order) and Dim Sum (Saturday and Sunday). Delicious food! Dim sum on the weekends especially, can get very unique and creative. The problem is, the service is lacking. It's hard to just get your glass refilled. And especially with the saltiness/fattiness of Dim Sum. That water's kinda crucial. It's hard to complain as well, as the same familiar faces serve you from dawn til dusk. And I'm sure they're tired after working over 12 hours a day. Overall, GREAT place for some Chinese food!

After countless rescheduling, the lovely SV girls and I finally met up for dim sum here. I arrived first, and was seated at a large round table that could've accommodated a small UYE. I thought we might have to share the table with another party, but then a couple was seated at a large round next to us. We took the last two tables on the main floor, and soon after the tables upstairs were filled up as well. I hadn't realized how large the space was - we could take over the upstairs area easily for a UYE. The dim sum was good, though we were surprised that the most popular items like shu mai, har gow, steamed BBQ pork buns, and such, never came out until we were already done with our meal. The selection was pretty average. I enjoyed the Shanghai dumplings, although they were on the small side. Service was a tad pushy (one woman asked us if we wanted chicken feet 3 times), but everyone was fairly nice. Had it not been for the company I was with, the nice open space and cleanliness of the place, I would probably give the dim sum a 3.5 star rating. We had quite a bit of food (thanks to Eve K!) and our bill came out to $13/person, which was very reasonable. I'd say that if you're looking for a nice dim sum spot in Mt. View, come here.

In college, I can recall about 5 different burrito places we would frequent depending on what mood we were in. All these places had their specialties and we rotated between them quite frequently. There was one place, however, that we would never be caught dead in. Well, unless it was late night. Even that crap factory had it's niche...it was open late. ?Like, late late. So, moral of the story is that places that are decent during the day automatically become magical when open during late night hours. Imagine my orgasmic splendor when I visited Fu Lam Mum. ? These guys have decent dim sum at decent prices and they serve it fresh until MIDNIGHT!!!! Three plates for $10 is their special and the stuff is good. ? I would probably visit another place during the day but for my after drunken escapades in Mt. View, Fu Lam Mum is where you will find me. Bite.

**OH MY GOSH!! I hit 200 Reviews! WOW! Yeah me!!!** I wish my 200th review could be for a 5 star place...sadly this isn't it and I had higher expectations for this place. Maybe the Dim Sum is better and I will be back for he Dim Sum. The food is good and pretty decent flavors. We ordered the following: Won Ton Soup--average; nothing great Salt and Pepper Shrimp--below average Beef with vegetables--the best dish we ordered. Great flavors! Eggplant and pork--good dish and lots of yummy flavor Pan fried noodles--done well The service was decent and we were helped continuously by a guy on a headset. He seemed to know what he was doing. Our waitress was very friendly. Now the decor...that is where it got me. Here you have this incredible Castro location with major potential to have this really cool restaurant and they use typical Asian restaurant furniture that only makes the place look cheap. I am not even an interior decorator and I could invision all of these beautiful ideas to really make this place have more pizzazz. Maybe its the way they want it to be but this building has way ?more potential then what they have done. Overall a decent place. Not my favorite but its in a close location to where I work on Castro so I might be back for some Dim Sum on a weekend. **Note to self--you use the word "decent" too many times in this review!!!**

What the heck was this place called again?? It took me five minutes to find it on Yelp to even be able to write my review...yikes...does that happen to anyone else or just me?! Thankfully, our lunchtime dining experience at FLM was much simpler. Walked in to find the lovely Connie swimming at a huge table made for about 20. We four gals huddled in a corner of the table...it actually made for more intimate convo which was perfect as we all chatted about life and caught up with each other. The food was good...my only real experiences with dim sum thus far are with Dynasty and Joy Luck and this was comparable. Large, natural brightly lit environment was cheery. The darling Eve K was our ordered and cart-flagger, she did it so fabulously. We had a hodgepodge of stuff on the table at any given point in time, honestly I don't know the fancy names and I don't care. Steamed shrimp, steamed shrimp and pork, steamed something else. Baked pork buns...shiny with buttery oil...though my poor Flor D could not have pork, only shrimpies. Chinese broccoli, one of my favorites as I gotta get my greens in!! The food was a little salty, so I just drank more of the hot jasmine tea that kept arriving in my little cup. For dessert, my fellow-sweet tooth Connie made sure to get us a mango pudding to try out, it was sweetly soft and tasty...but not overpowering on any of the flavors. I only had a few small bites, because otherwise I could have easily slurped the whole thing down. Price wise, it was very competitive as for everything we had it was only $13 per person including tip. Fabulous lunch during a weekday, wonderful food and even better lovely gal company...thanks ladies and FLM.

Good food, nice atmosphere. Minus two star for the absent minded waiter/slow tortuous food delivery and service. Very few of us there, so I'm not sure why he couldn't get our order right the first time, but the last few times at least they got the order right. Of course when we ask, they look at the little printout they leave on the table. Is it just me or are they always like this? We usually come in late and they're just tired. But they're consistently bad with service and timing of the dishes. It's funny, each time we come here it's the same: one dish takes a long time, ?next dish the same, repeat... until we have to tell our waiter about our last two dishes.... and the tea, and the... I'd like to warm up to this place more as almost all of the dishes have been really good and tasty, but the dish every 15-20 minutes and having to flag down our waiter is obnoxious.

I might be white but I do KNOW MY CHINESE food. And I have to say that Fu Lam Mum is TAI HAO LE!! This has become our new "go to" place for Chinese food in Mountain View. Initially they did have a few rough spots when they first opened but now they have more than overcome any short comings. The manager/owner here are great guys. They always great us personally with a smile and remember us from our prior visits. The food here is very good. A few of our favorite dishes are the salt and pepper fish, the sweet and sour chicken, the fried noodles with seafood and the dim sum is on par with some of the better dim sum houses in the bay area. Bottom line...You can't go wrong going to Fu Lam Mum and it even gets better after 9pm with their special late night menu! Enjoy!!

We used to go to the old location for lunch and dinner. I remembered it to be okay.... I preferred Kirin better. We came to try the new location for dinner and it is the same owner and the restaurant is just pretty nice. Decor is nice and it's gone rather upscale compared to the old place. I have been trying to fight off some nasty cold/flu and the chest congestion is just killing me. I wanted to have some 'lo foh tong' or soup that's been cooking on 'old fire' which means soup that's been cooking all day long. The first thing upon walking into the restaurant I asked the owner if he had that today and he said yes. I was thrilled. We were seated, given menus and I immediately saw 'pei pah tofu'. Generally this dish is on a specials board in the US but here they've incorporated it into part of the regular menu. I also wanted pea shoots but they were out so just settled for gai lan. I asked about fresh fish and wanted something within the 1 lb vicinity and the owner said the snapper was good. I also ordered the Peking style spare ribs for the boys. As we waited for our food, hubby saw the next table get an order of cha siu. He asked for some as well. Soon, my soup arrived. I asked the woman what it was and thankfully it was green radish, carrot and pork soup -- something perfect for my throat ailments. As we chatted about the properties of the soup she served our soup and then we dug in. It was very good. I ended up having 3 bowls. Cha siu was very well done, moist and succulent and perfectly seasoned -- not too sweet and not too salty. Everyone enjoyed it. The 'pei pah tofu' was also very well received by all. Hubby had never had this dish before and the young man helped himself. Our friend liked it too. I'm going to have to say that the steamed fish here was done far better than at ABC since the soy sauce was lighter and less salty. The fish I had at ABC was overcooked so the fish was a little hard and the soy sauce was very dark and salty. Here it was done to perfection! The fish was cooked to perfect tenderness. It would've been a real waste if they hadn't since that fish alone was $31. At the end of the meal we got some coconut jello as complimentary dessert. Would've preferred the soupy desserts but oh well. I'd say Fu Lam Mum has come a long way since its days at the old location. Service was pretty good too. 4.5 stars.

Two men walk into Fu Lam Mum. ?One was an civil engineer, the other an interior designer. The engineer says "WTFOMGLOL. ?The second floor is a waste of interior space. ?If they got rid of the high ceiling, they could double the second floor and cram more people up top. efficiency! efficiency! *Snort*" The interior designer exclaims "Sacre Bleu! ?Black and white interior. ?high ceilings with boring florescent flood lights. ?Two Pinecone chandeliers (the same ones found in UCSC's Science Library, so not the fondest of memories come into mind when seeing them)" I don't know where this story is headed but their dim sum comes out bland to Mr. Taste buds. The best has to be their rice noodles. ? everything else, including Shao Mai, Shia Jiao, Chang Fun (I'm not Canto, suck it up) ?needed some spicing up. Dinner seemed to be on the Pricy side. And rice is now charged per bowl instead of per person, so rice-lovers beware. ?The flavors of the dishes are nothing special, but lacks anything to complain about. But here's something to cheer for: they are open until 12, so older aged party animals like my parents can come for some intense Shiao Yie with their friends. Party on, mom and dad.

Hmm...not bad...however, based on the rave reviews I was expecting to be awed by the dim sum, but that didn't exactly happen. Thankfully there was no wait time for us party of two, but they shoved us in a cramped corner of the restaurant where waiters frequently visited to pick up utensils, napkins, etc. Very distracting and NOT COOL. But the place is beautiful and spacious inside. I can see why it's become so popular despite it being slightly pricier than other places. Various carts came about regularly, but some same carts (with not so warm food) were rotating more than the others. We had to grab a waiter's attention and ask for our staple items. As for the dim sum, it was decent, but not impressive enough to make us want to go back immediately. The rice balls wrapped in lotus leaf (sorry, don't know the actual name) and tofu skin (yuba?) were good. Ha gow lacked a bit of flavor and wasn't as juicy as I'd wanted it to be. BBQ pork was ok, but the quality wasn't really there. Maybe we didn't order enough items to really appreciate the food here?! SUM: We'd certainly return, but if we had more time to spare we'd drive down to Cupertino for better dim sum...

If you're a lover of dim sum, late night snacks after 9, then hit this place up. The past chefs and waitresses and waiters have moved over from Joy Luck Place, YES the Joy Luck from Cupertino. I've been here once for dimsum, and 3 times for the late night special after 9. The dim sum is as good as it gets, they even have a new dessert called taro bun, that is this crisp baked bun but with soft and moist sweet taro inside. The chicken legs (fung jow) were not colored, were tender and big, not too spicy and reminiscent of Hong Kong. Late night specials baby!!! AFTER 9 at night everyday they have a special for 8 bucks for a lot of dishes and also 3 dimsum dishes for 10 bucks. I've eaten: 1) Salt & Pepper Fish Fillet: THIS IS excellent because the batter is different than most. It is less flour but more like the batter of katsu chicken. Yet they are able to contain the fish inside and when you bite in, it is moist and wet. The pepper and salt is a fine mix of jalapenos, red pepper, and fried garlic. You can tell that this is not cheap frozen fish, but rather from what Chinese call it "swimming fish," indicating live fish. 2) Beef Brisket In Supreme Broth- (ngau nam boh) THIS surprised me. there was no MSG, and the soup was drinkable. It's a broth cooked with 1 centimeter thick sliced beef brisket, daikon, celery, and chinese cilantro. It comes out in a steel plate over a candel that keeps it warm. Not bad! 3) Braised Spicy Salsa w/ Tofu: This dish is not as Mexican as it sounds. It's fried tofu, that gets the outside brown. Then it is coated in black bean sauce and cooked with jalapenos and red peppers sliced in half. If you love spicy food, then I recomend biting into the peppers while eating the tofu. This dish isn't as good as the first 2 I recommended, but this type of tofu is hard to make. 4) Braised Tofu w/ preserved Vegetable & Mushroom: Good thing I ate this dish so that I could paint a more thorough picture for you! This has the black Chinese fungus, the Chinese mushroom that looks like a hood, the fat Taiwanese mushroom that is eaten by slicing it by its trunk. The sauce is once again, homemade but great. 5) "gone chow ow horh" : There's no English for this dish but if you say it like this to the waiter, trust me they'll understand it. This dish is wide noodles that is fried with bean sprouts, green onions, beef, and onions. Classic and great! 6) "sup chow ow horh": This is the cousin of the 5th dish, it is wet (sup), but does carry different ingredients. It is the best I've had because I usually order the dry one. It doesn't have bean sprouts but has sliced carrots and the same beef and bok choy (white vegetable). THE service here is great, not only the food. They give you soup and free dessert if you eat there for dinner. It does not surprise me that this restaurant is so multicultural. I've seen the whole melting pot dine here. When you walk in, for a moment you'll think you're in Hong Kong TSIM SHA TSUI. It is a great environment. EAT here! I CAME HERE AGAIN 2 nights ago! Pictures coming in a few days and a reivew on 1 new dish!

I come here on Tuesdays or Thursdays for their Peking Duck! ?It's ridiculously cheap for only $15 and can easily be shared with 2-3 people. Original price for Peking Duck is a whopping $28. The duck is meaty with crispy, shiny skin that tastes amazing. It's very greasy and fatty though, so beware if you care about your waistline or arteries. If you haven't had Peking Duck before, they bring out a whole duck chopped into pieces with a side of hoisen sauce and spring onions with fresh baos (steamed buns). If you come here during lunch time, they serve dim sum which is equally as delicious as their Peking duck. Notable mentions are the chicken feet, har gow and siu mai. The xiao long bao (soup dumplings) were just okay and was missing the soup! The soup is the best part of a xiao long bao! I've also tried the baby suckling pig which has super crispy skin and tender juicy meat. ?The beef and scallops with bell pepper was tasty and the vegetable and vermicelli dish is a nice dish if you're looking for a vegetable dish with not a lot of overpowering flavors. The restaurant's ambiance is nice and clean, well lit with tall glass windows but service can be a bit slow during rush hours. The restaurant attracts business people during lunches and large Chinese families in the evenings for dinner. I would be more of a regular at this restaurant if it wasn't so far away from me.

Very favorite Chinese restaurant! ?Cantonese (lighter sauce to taste the fresh food, as opposed to heavier-sauced, spicier Szechuan) style, mostly Asian customers. ?It was introduced to me by a very selective Chinese friend. ?I have to ask them to hold the MSG, and they do. ?I sometimes also have to ask them to cook without the oil being too hot, which gives the food a charred flavor and ruins it. My favorite dishes (the first of which isn't on the English menu - only in Chinese, but it's my favorite): ?Fish (cod, I think) in two dishes (fresh fish from tank - one dish is a soup made from the bones, napa cabbage, tofu, ginger, mushrooms and the other is fish filet with bok choy), braised bean curd, spicy eggplant, green vegetable (whatever they recommend that day). ?Their steamed fish is amazing because it's so fresh. Avoid the more Americanized dishes like Lemon Chicken - the sauce is good, but the meat in these less authentic dishes is inferior (fatty dark meat). ?I go mostly for the veg/bean curd/fish, but if you want chicken, try Drunken Chicken (their Ginseng Chicken was really good too, but I'm not sure if it's on the menu anymore).

Three words...... Dim Sum We've been here a few times. ?Most of them during dim sum. ?I would have to say their dim sum is pretty good. ?As with any dim sum place, if you say a list of their items, you will sound strikingly similar to Bubba from Forrest Gump...... .........shrimp shu mai, shrimp noodles, fried shrimp, shrimp balls, shrimp in crab claw, walnut shrimp, shrimp har gow, kung pao shrimp............ While their food was up to par, I have a little warning. ?After eating here, I always have the urge to drink large sums of water. ?Could that be lots of salt or maybe even MSG? ?Maybe. ?But, let's be honest, are there any dim sum places out there that don't have this drawback? ?I think not. Okay, Dim Sum is only 2 words. ?I just wanted to see if you are reading entire reviews. Also, don't you guys feel like eating shrimp now???

For those of us who dine later in the evening - this was a gem of a find. My brother and his wife invited me and S out for a late night, belated birthday supper. I didn't know of a place that served dim sum in the evening (I always thought it was a Sunday brunch kinda thing) - so I was game to try out something new. The menu was extensive - along with the usual dim sum offerings, there's a full menu with noodles, rice, porridge, pork, chicken, beef and duck ?dishes. We ordered a good sampling of dim sum along with pork ribs with pumpkin and sauteed spinach - all was fresh and good. Service was a bit on the slow side, however, and it took a while for some one to take our order and for the food to arrive at our table.

A typical Chinese Restaurant serving Dim Sum. The Dim Sum is decent. Ordinary choices, nothing too amazing, and nothing too awful. However, the 4 stars are related to the 4 non-typical things in a Chinese Restaurant, that Fu Lam Moon provided. 1 . An actual CLEAN bathroom. I wore sandals inside, and didn't come out, feeling the need to disinfectant my feet with rubbing alcohol and a match. 2. GOOD service. The dim sum ladies, managers, and waitstaff were very friendly and attentive. Our water glasses were always filled to the top. Not once did we have to prop the top to our tea pot to signal that we needed more hot water. 3. NO MSG! After the meal, no dry mouth, no urge to drink a gallon of water to cleanse my system, no allergic reacion on my face. 4. They have a full bar with top shelf liquor. Which, in my opinion, is what's missing from a lot of other chinese restaurants. Once in awhile, it's nice to get yo' drank on with a steaming plate of chow fun.

I need to come back here with more people because when my boyfriend and I came here for dinner one night we were overwhelmed. The menu was huge and Chinese food is hard to order for just 2 to get the variety that you want. We chose 3 different things...I'm sure if anyone who knows Chinese food would've laughed at us because the things we picked were a mix between more Americanized items and things that did not really go together, but we were starving and craving weird things. They had some different things that I'd never heard of, but I find it hard to get a sense of what a dish is from the description that a lot of Chinese restaurants give so we kind of also tried to play it safe. The food was okay. My boyfriend was more of a fan of it than I was, but I think I was thrown off by the combination we ordered. I also thought that a couple things were got were a little too salty. I would definitely like to go back not only with more people, but also with someone who knows what to order.

My Taiwanese friend Tina told me this was a good dim sum place and the best one there is in Silicon Valley so since I like dim sum and trust her taste, we went here a few weeks ago. My other friend and Tina's roommate, Emma came with us. They did most of the ordering and I don't quite recall what the name of the dishes were, but one was a stuffed mushroom one with some shrimp int it. We also got some steamed pork dumplings and fried shrimp ones. Not all the dim sum plates were the same price. So when in doubt, ask. One dish turned out to be $6.75 for only four pieces and that was for the mushroom and shrimp dim sum. Most of the dishes were less than $4.00. I thought most of the dishes were good, but I was disappointed that they hardly had any fried dim sum. I have a huge weakness for fried food. I guess it's for the best that they didn't as I need to loose weight. The place is very popular and was very crowded on a weekday. The crowd consisted of mostly Asian people which is always a good sign when you're in an Asian place. They also have other dishes here and they also have live crab and lobsters available. Parking is hard to find, but there is a big lot in the back. I think that you can only park there for two hours though.

I hardly ever know what to order at Dim Sum restaurants. I just have my favorites to stick by! The Combination Pan Fried Noodles, Honey Walnut Prawns and some Salt and Pepper Fish. Always good to me!!! I do enjoy the dim sum carts, but they weren't in service when we came on a Thursday night. Apparently dim sum is served in the wee hours of the night for you night owls! The food was really good, who knows coulda been the MSG! Whatever it is, its pretty bomb. Prices are decent too, the establishment is nice and clean.

I'm actually excited (and a bit worried) that there's such a good dim sum place near my work! ?I'm a sucker for dim sum... but dammit I should be dieting! The insides are really nice - high ceilings and very clean. ?The first floor is small, so carts go by frequently. ?You will never have to wait long for a cart. The service was probably the best service I had at a real Asian restaurant (i.e. not PF Chang's). ?They were all really sweet and made sure we were taken care of. It got really busy at noon, so get there around 11:30 if you can! ?Or don't... ?Flor and I will be fighting you for that seat!

Dimsum on Sunday....Amazing. Err there is still a line even past 1pm. ?Whats the deal here? ? Must be because there is no decent dimsum place around the area. Not many carts but they do serve the dimsum on platters. 6 people, 70$ total with lots of orders. Not bad eh?

Dimsum @ Fu Lam Mum. ? Mediocre at best. ?I guess the one draw with this place is the price. ?It's relatively cheap, hence you see the line spilling out onto the sidewalk of Castro St. ? The only thing really memorable from my dimsum experience at FLM were the deep fried shrimp balls. ?They were quite tasty since they were fresh from the kitchen. ? ? Other than that....the porridge was watered down. ?The sui mai were meh. ?The hargow were blah. ?The chicken feet were not tasty. Definitely uninspiring dimsum.

So after running in the Bubba Gump 5K event on Sunday, Cobber, Crys, and I were hungry and wanted to find something to eat. ?We were first talking about going to Maruichi Ramen, but realizing that it was barely 10 am, I figured that we would have to wait an hour or so before it opened. ?Crys B suggested that we get dim sum over at Fu Lam Mum. ? Being my first time to the restaurant (new location or otherwise), I had no idea what to expect. ?I'm also not a big fan of dim sum, so wasn't too excited about going, but it's been years since I last had dim sum (I was trying to remember, and it was at the now defunct Sam Kee, probably about 3-4 years ago). So for me, there are two menu items at dim sum that I get really excited about: ?Little Dragon Balls (Hsiao Loong Bao sp?) and Daikon Cake (Luo Buo Gao sp?) Maybe it was because I recently was at Din Tai Fung, but I was extremely disappointed with the Hsiao Loong Bao. ?It had absolutely no soup inside, but maybe that was because they also didn't provide us with soup spoons, so in order to compensate for that, they made the baos really dry. ?I expect these to be so full of soup that when I pick them up with my chopsticks, I want to see the skin droop at the bottom from all the liquid inside, so that it is necessary to have the soup spoon. ?In any case, this was a real deal breaker for me, and I will probably never go back here again. The Daikon Cake was fine, but nothing too memorable. If it were just me and Cobber dining together, aside from being extremely gay, I think we would have ordered the tsou dofu (stinky tofu), which I would be willing to try, but then again, seeing how the rest of the food was, and being that we couldn't smell it from the table that ordered it a few tables away, it probably wouldn't have been that good anyway. Now that I think about it, I don't think we had any vegetables, and I don't remember seeing an A-Tsai or any other kind of veggies... I think the daikon cake was maybe one of the closest things... I guess the restaurant put in a lot of effort into making the place look modern and nice, but come on, let's get real here... this is a Chinese restaurant... I expect good food, not good decor... and being Chinese, I expect to be paying for the food, not for the fancy surroundings. Overall, I can't say that I was too impressed with this place, but again, realize that I don't eat dim sum very often, so maybe my expectations were too high...

Enjoyed this place so much we had to go twice on the same day. Our first experience was around 12pm. The place was overflowing with people. With all of the chaos around them, the host and servers were really friendly and the food was great. On our second round we came in at 11pm for their 'Late Night Dim Sum.' Yes, Late Night! Even though they were going to close at 12am, they treated us as if the sun was still out. Actually, one of the servers at 11:45 asked us (really nicely) to close our check and told us that we could stay as long as we wanted. The menu is smaller than the early hours but still good. The PM special is 3 items for $10, which is perfect for a tight budget. The decor was much nicer than the other dim sum/Chinese places I've been to. And, I've never had Dim Sum so close to midnight, which was awesome!

Food was solid Cantonese style seafood: -Beef, cilantro, egg white soup -Pan fried Bass filet w/veggies -Braised Tofu w/bok choy & mixed mushrooms -Steamed soy sauce chicken with ginger & scallions Everything was very good, not too oily or salty. ?Flavors were delicate, ingredients were julienned perfectly and presented nicely. ?Pricey, but good. ?$80 incl. tip & tax. ?

The restaurant got packed pretty quickly. ?Service was good for the amount of people we had, though I wish the waiters came around more often to refill our tea. ?Maybe have 2 pots per table of 11? ?Just a thought.

I was really worried when Fu Lam renovated and got all hoity-toity and trendy looking, and especially when they jacked up their prices. ?Who wouldn't love a decent late night meal for $7? ?Now it's $9 but the quality seems dare I say a little bit better. The interior is nice and the service is usually OK. ?Once in awhile you get the server with a bit of attitude but the people at the front and the owner--who always seems to be there--are nice. After going a half dozen times, the typical fare has been narrowed down to basically the rock cod with black bean sauce and the black pepper beef. ?Good stuff. And best of all, this place is open late. ?I'm super tired of Pho Hoa especially when filled with all the wannabe clubbers coming out of Buddha.

Fu Lam Mum,.. dude +3 Stars for the name alone. ?Though I have no idea what it means or what it stands for, it's nice seeing a Chinese restaurant without "Dynasty" or "Palace" in the name. ? But beyond the words on the door, Fu Lam Mum offers a nice selection of what seems to be American/Cantonese dishes. ?The dinner menu offers a variety of soups to start your meal with, and many chicken, pork, beef, seafood and veggie entrees. ?We shared the Seafood soup, which was somewhat bland, but a nice beginning to our dinner. ?Nothing a little black pepper and red vinegar couldn't fix. ?But the half duck we ordered, man was it absolutely delicious. ?The skin was amazingly crispy and the meat was flavorful and very tender. ?The plum sauce was a tad salty, but still tasty. ? The ambiance and decor of the restaurant was very impressive. ?I guess the interior can be described as modern and somewhat upscale. ?I would say dining at a Chinese restaurant without tapestries of dragons, and scenic portraits of the homeland was a nice change. ? There is also a section of the restaurant located upstairs that would be ideal for a private party. ?And +1 Star for these really awesome doors that close off smaller rooms upstairs for private parties of 20-30 people ;) ?Check 'em out..

REMODEL/AMBIANCE: The Fu Lam of old offered decent food at a super low price. ?They had great lunch specials, and the same specials were available from 9 PM - 1 AM for late-nighters, which I took advantage of countless times. After being closed for remodeling for a few months, Fu Lam is back! ?The interior is brand-spanking new now with two floors, the furniture and tableware is totally different, their food quality and presentation is slightly better, the staff has tripled, and their prices are up a few bucks a dish. ?The ambiance is now like that of a high-end Chinese restaurant, still too rowdy for a date, but not dumpy like its predecessor. This isn't the same Fu Lam as before: ?You're probably better off now going elsewhere if you're looking for rock-bottom prices. ?But, it's still a great place to get affordable, high-quality Cantonese food at all hours. FOOD: I've always enjoyed the food at Fu Lam Mum. ?It's certainly not the best Chinese food in the area, but it's definitely first tier and good enough to be a regular stop. ?I like more dishes than I can remember here but here are some favorites off the top of my head: - roast duck won ton noodle soup - fish fried rice - free soup that comes with specials - fried flounder - chicken with black bean sauce - salt and pepper ribs - pea sprouts DIM SUM: A new highlight of the reopening is they now serve dim sum at lunch! ?It's competitive at roughly $11/meal and the food was above average quality. ?The only downside is their selection is limited and we saw the same 3-4 carts come by again and again. ?Service was good and our tea pot was quickly refilled countless time. If you live in the Mountain View area, there's no reason not to come to dim sum here; it's competitive with all the other dim sum places in the area. ?But if you live farther east or south, there's also little reason to choose Fu Lam over a place in Milpitas or Cupertino. All in all, Fu Lam Mum is as great as ever. ?It'll definitely continue to be a regular stop for me.

Surprisingly there was still a wait at 2pm sunday afternoon. We had to wait around 20 minutes before we were seated. The shou mei tea came almost immediately upon ordering. To simplify things I've broken up the review of the dim sum into 4 categories(pretty self-explanatory I think). Yummy ---------- taro buns: crunchy goodness on top, cripsy buttery bottom and fragrant taro paste in the middle. Eat these while they're hot! egg tarts: flaky pastry with a tasty egg custard in the middle. You'll have to drive to SF(golden gate bakery) to get better ones... Yum: Steamed beef balls: One of the very few places that aren't trigger-happy with the baking soda. You can actually taste the beef! The extra cilantro they put in is a nice touch. Eh: ---- Chicken feet: They're ok... ?a bit too much bean sauce. I had better. Steamed Pork ribs: these should have been steamed a bit longer for tenderness and flavor. Ugh: -------------------------------- char siu tsang fun: the rice noodles a bit too thick giving this traditional dim sum dish a almost unpalatable gummy consistency. The char siu on the other hand is too salty. shiao long bao: the skin on these puppies are waaay too thick. It completely overwhelms the taste of the stuffing. The frozen ones at your local chinese supermarket are better(but not by much). steamed beef tripe: bland bland bland. 'nuff said.

I had a lovely lunch here on a Saturday and the place was packed. ? My friend loves the chicken feet. ?He practically devoured 2 dishes and although I am usually adventurous in my choice of dishes, I just couldn't bring myself to try them. ?Too many icky parts for me. I liked the soup dumplings, but I did think that the wrapper was a bit on the heavy side. ?Shrimp dumplings were good, but the wrapper was a bit on the sticky side and they were very hard to extract from the steamer basket in tact. I liked the BBQ pork buns. ?They were a good size, but I found the filling a bit too much on the sweet side. Overall, I would return here, but I do think that there are better places in the Bay Area for Dim Sum.

Late night eats (until midnight) in Mountain View. Get the braised Tofu with Chilli ($8). Comes with rice and is the perfect size for one person. Great option if you don't want Pho Hoa. The dim sum is pretty good too, but kind of expensive. Oh how I miss my NYC Chinatown cheap, delicious dim sum.

For some reason, singing makes me hungry. ?Or HANGRY (combo of hungry and angry). ?I was borderline hangry after a marathon sing-a-thon at my church, and needed to get some food, and fast. Since it was around 10:30 pm, we decided our best bet was to head to Fu Lam Mum since they were open until midnight on the weekends. The restaurant itself is like stepping foot into a restaurant in Asia--sens the air conditioning blasting. ?High ceilings, sleek interior, wall of live seafood, and huge tables with lazy susans. ? We were seated really quickly, and given a menu of their late evening menu. ?It was nice that they had dim sum this late at night, and we ordered three: ?siu mai, a chives and shrimp dumplings, and har gao. ?For the four of us, we also ordered two entrees: ?clay pot eggplant with a garlic sauce, and Cantonese chicken. ?All items showed-up really quickly, and were great. ?I'm not sure if it was the hangerness, or the pure exhaustion, but the food was totally great. Service was ok, as well. ?I don't expect all that much from Chinese restaurants, but found that our tea was consistently refilled, when we asked for it. Other than taking your order and bringing out your food, don't expect to see your waiter again. ? We walked out of the place paying under $10/person which wasn't that bad. ?It's a nice option for later eating in Mountain View, and judging from the wall of bamboo steamers that I saw in the kitchen, Fu Lam Mum definitely is a place that I'd like to try for dim sum.

What the?! I don't get it. Why is this place crowded? It must be because there are literally no other dim sum places in mountain view. Because I'm sorry but places like Yank Sing blow this place out of the water. Not sure how this place can get more than 2 stars. Honestly. Perhaps it's because there are no other dimsum places in Mountain View. If you're craving dimsum, you live in MV and don't feel like driving for more than 10 minutes than come here. Otherwise don't eat. Sadly, I think even Ming's is better than Fu Lam Mum. I really don't get it. In terms of service, slightly better than Ming's but only slightly. Still not worth making a trip here. Maybe I missed something? Are their normal dishes better? Perhaps, but I don't think I'd like to find out. Ok so the food isn't horrid, it's edible and at times I think average at best. But when you wait 30 min. to get a table you expect the food to be better than average. NOT.

Went on Sunday at 2:30pm, they have dim sum late, til 3pm. ?Had around ?7 dishes for $30 for two. ?Only one or two carts at one time rolling around but a couple of ladies with trays of food were also roaming around. ?Got everything that I liked. ?The gailan was fresh and crispy and the custard cups, heavenly, the crusts were so flakey, but tiny. ?Har gow had big shrimp in the wrappings. ?Siu Mai had plenty of pork in them. ?The XLB didn't have the juice in them when I bit into them. ? Only 3 small chao siu bao but they were good. This place is huge since it moved to it's new location, two floors. ?Very nice. ?The staff is friendly and accommodating and on the ball.

Quite possibly the best/only choice for dim sum in the downtown Mountain View area. Because it's one of the few choices in the area, they can effectively jack up the prices on us dim sum seeking suckers. Okay, enough with my bitterness... The dim sum is alright. I found that the dishes were a little cold by the time it came out to us. It's pretty nice that they open late into the night. So you can fill that late night dim sum craving. But even with the late night special, the prices are still on the high side. Gotta give it to them though... it's pretty darn clean for a chinese restaurant :P

I am not a Chinese food expert, or dim sum expert and until recently didn't really like it. ?Blame it on years of my mom loving Safeway Chinese food. So I came here with my boy for lunch on a Friday. ?It was pretty packed and just a few tables were open in this tall ceiling, open spaced restaurant. ?The hostess isn't what I'd call nice but she was quick to seat us, get our table set and ready for lunch. ?The dim sum carts were rolling around and while again the waitress isn't what I'd call nice - she showed my boy all the different types and was attentive. ? We got some shrimp balls - ok, I've had better, the dough was a little gummy. ?We also got some bbq pork, w/sticky rice in a leaf - it was pretty good but not something to recommend or memorable. ?We also got some mixture of ball with shrimp and veggies - that was my favorite, had a fair amount of flavor but I've had better. ?While everything was ok, nothing was amazing. ?All the little carts were piping hot, our dim sum seemed fresh and the service was quick. The place itself lacks any ambiance, it's a big open room, little bit of decor, huge fish tanks in the back where you can see your soon to be food but at least it all felt fairly clean and neat. Eh, ok food. ?Ok service. ?Ok setting.

I am flabbergasted that this restaurant averages four stars. ?A travesty to my heritage! The only good thing about this restaurant is that it's open late. ?The food is uninspired and oily. ?I can speak from experience, having eaten here many times because it was the only thing open at midnight. Queen House across the street is far superior.

Update near the bottom. =====Original review==== 4 stars ====== Fu Lam Mum has been around for decades. ?BTW, was it spelled with Mum or Mun or Moon before? ?The Mum spelling does not match the Chinese pronunciation that well. ?I remember it was around when I used to live in Mtn. View like 20 years ago. ?They closed the location across the street and moved to the new building. I got to eat dim sum there Sunday morning on their second day of business. ?The wait was less than 10 minutes. ?I guess not many people knew about its reopening yet. ?The restaurant has two stories. ?The second floor is like a loft that hangs over about 1/4 of the floor below. ?Most of the first floor has very high ceiling. ?I think it will work nicely as a banquet hall. Okay, back to the dim sum. ?They were okay. ?My wife said they were a little bland. ?I kind of think it is better because of the lighter use of MSG. ?They had a computer malfunction today and it took forever to get the bill paid. I actually saw a long line of people going up to the cashier to find out what the hold-up was. ?The waiter apologized and when we said we could pay cash, we were out the door within minutes. ?Service was good, water filled frequently, dim sum carts passed by more frequently than we could consume our dishes, the bus boy took away empty dishes pretty quickly too. ?One bus boy even offered to change the plates for us, but we declined in order to save our Earth and our precious water. I have not tried their dinner yet. ? The big aquarium like fish tanks at the back of the restaurant displayed some live seafood. ?The water was pretty clear, so I guess the live seafood should be quite healthy. ?Since Fu Lam Mum has been famous for seafood for decades, I guess the new location will not change its reputation. ?I won't give the fifth star until I really tried their dinner menu. === update on May 2, 2008 === still 4 stars ==== We had dinner there on a Friday night. ?They didn't earn the fifth star from me. ? The dinner was okay. ?Some dishes very good. ?Some dishes not. ? All the dishes tasted great, the seasoning was excellent. ?So their chef is great. ?The biggest complaint from me would be the ingredient. ?We had a beef dish and I could only taste the seasoning but not much meat taste. We had a fish dish that was wonderfully fresh. ?Then we had another seafood dish with squids and scallops etc. The squids smelled a little fishy (really really fresh seafood should not smell). ?I expected perfect seafood dishes from a seafood restaurant, so I may be more demanding and critical than normal. ?Though not a 5 stars, 4 stars is good enough in my book. It has been a week since their opening. ?They still had problems with their operation. ?People waited for over 30 minutes after placing the order, we looked around us, seemed to affect everyone equally, no discrimination. ?We saw a couple just walked away because they were too impatient to wait. ?Our waitress disappeared from time to time, so we couldn't get any service even if we waved. ?She might have been standing outside the kitchen to get our food. On the Friday evening, the restaurant was 80% full with people waiting outside. ?It was probably a smart move not to fill the vacant tables because either the chef nor the waiters were ready for the load. ?It is probably as expected for a brand new restaurant. ?However, they'd better smooth out their operation soon because the excuse wears out quickly. A week into their opening, their wine rack upstairs is still empty. ?I wonder why the liquor license cannot be issued along with the restaurant license. ?I would expect health inspection of the kitchen would be tougher to pass than that of the wine racks. ==== update on May 19 ==== down to 3 stars ===== I am taking one star off my review. ?I ate there couple more times and I didn't see any improvement. ? We went for dinner at 7:45pm on Saturday evening, we called ahead for reservation, the guy told me there was no waiting so he was not giving me a number. ?I told him I was on my way, so I kind of forced him to write down my name in case the crowd showed up. ?When we arrived, the hostess said our reservation was at 8pm. ?I told her that I didn't tell the time because I was told I didn't even need a reservation. ?Now I have to wait because that guy put my name at the 8pm slot. ?I was kind of upset because if he had taken down my reservation properly, I would have told him 7:45pm. ?It turned out the wait was not too bad and we were seated within 10 minutes. We ordered like 6 dishes and the soup du jour. ?They came out one at a time about 10 minutes apart. ?It took us 2 to 3 minutes to finish a dish, then we looked at each other and the empty table for 8 minutes. ?And another dish came. ?Repeat... ?The bus boy came over several times to take our chopsticks and plates away because even he thought the dinner was over. ?We had to tell him more dishes were yet to come.

Overpriced, cold, more or less tasteless, and clearly catered to those who do not appreciate quality dim sum. Friend and I ordered the following for a grand total of $30 post-tax and tip: 1x Shaomai 1x Spare ribs 1x Wu gok 1x Beef rice noodle roll 1x Taro dumplings 1x Xiao long bao But then again, anyone who frequents the likes of Koi Palace, Great Eastern, and HK Saigon naturally has much higher expectations of dim sum. Also, turn down the AC - we were literally freezing to death on what was a sunny Saturday day.

Had Dim Sum for lunch here the other day. Walnut prawns - Good, sweet and fresh, nicely cooked. Cold Beancurd w/minced shitake - Very nice umami flavor w/delicate thin layers of beancurd. Har gow - Nicely thin wrapper but shrimp seemed oversteamed, not very sweet. Rice noodle roll w/shrimp - Soy sauce seemed too salty, and rice roll wasn't as silky. Gai Lan - Ok, slightly undercooked, served with hoisin sauce. Pan fried shrimp & chive dumpling - Smallest I've ever had, but good flavor. Served slighty tepid, but nicely browned. Egg custart Tart - Very flaky crust and eggy custard, pretty good if you like your custard on the eggier side. Lunch was going good until we saw the bill. At $20/each, we thought it was pretty pricey for what we had, and then my expectations basically shot up. So 3 stars it is.

Pricey food, sloooooooooow service, and very curt service. The interior of this restaurant is really showy and modern as some have mentioned, but it would be nice if the food had backed it up. We came in a party of four, and ordered 4 dishes - barbecued pork (cha siu), lemon chicken, braised eggplant, beef chow fun with bok choy, and 4 orders of rice. The pork came first, followed by the lemon chicken, but our rice was nowhere to be found! We waited ... and waited ... and still nothing. Finally we waved down one of the servers who was blazing past us and requested our rice. The food was getting a bit cold at this point, and we didn't want to indulge in the dishes without the staple dish! We also found that unless you have 5 people, they won't give you a container of steamed rice -- only bowls. That's absurd by any Chinese restaurant standards, especially if you're wiling to pay for the rice. Our waitress was very very adamant about this, and unfortunately it reflected poorly on our dinner experience. Overall, the food was not memorable, and I don't think we'd come again based on the horrible service.

This is my favorite dim sum spot on weekends. ?And, I'd even go as far to say, Fu Lum Mum is better than all the dim sum places I've frequented in New York. ?The dim sum here is incredibly light unlike what you usually expect with Chinese food (heavy, oily). ?During the weekends this place gets packed so be prepared to wait. ?The good news is since the place is huge, you should be seated within 20 minutes. ?To me, that's more than acceptable for good solid dim sum. They have all your staple dim sum dishes and a mediocre selection of the more obscure ones. ?They also have a late night dim sum menu with 3 dim sum choices for $10 every night 9pm-midnight. ?I've been here once for the special and although there's a slightly longer wait, the dim sum is just as good if not better than the day time since it's steamed to order! * * * This review is only for their dim sum and not so much their regular menu. ?For regular Chinese dishes, this place pales in comparison to its better competitors. ?I'd give the Chinese dishes here 2 stars, but their dim sum gets 4 stars!

Average dim sum in a big location with mixed service. Have seen this place pretty busy on weekends during dim sum so decided to give it a try. ?Dim sum was ok overall but nothing that wowed me. Only gripes: Shrimp dumpling - tasty but skin was chewy and very sticky, ?clumping together with the others in the bamboo steamer. Steamed tofu w/shrimp on top - had a white hair on one of the pieces. Ew, but if you have eaten at enough Chinese places in your life, it happens. At least they gave us another dim sum dish to make up for it. The servers were all hustling to pitch us their goods so no worries about being hungry at this place. The bus boys were quick and good to refill our tea proactively. The owner/manager guy seemed very friendly to everyone. The only person who didn't provide good service was the hostess. She was dressed in all black trying to look like a wannabe HK movie star with matching attitude. No smile, nothing as she gave us a number at the beginning and a cold stare on the way out. Call her the HK ice princess. ? Pretty big location w/2 floors so the wait was not too bad. Bottom line: Nice that downtown Mt View has a legit dim sum place (Golden Wok was horrible, RIP). Dim sum will address your craving but won't be memorable. HK Ice Princess - do you really need all that attitude?! Lighten up.

Dim Sum Review... This place has pretty standard dim sum, although portions were on the smaller side as compared with other bay area dim sum spots. Got the "standard" fare...xia jiao (shrimp dumplings), shu mai, chinese broccoli, radish cakes, taro dumplings, xia chang fen (shrimp wrapped in rice noodles) and nothing really stood out. ?I did leave full so that's always a good thing. We got there 30 min after opening and the place was relatively empty.had about 5 tables seated but all of the food in the carts were literally in the corner just waiting to be served...I can only imagine how long they sit there for. This place has a ton of seating space so I can't imagine people would have to wait to get seated...unless you come during the busy late night hours that people review about! Quick Tip: Don't stress out about street parking...there's a parking lot in the back but it fills up quickly!

I usually frequent the dim sum restaurants in Cupertino as they are the flagship of dim sum in the south bay. ?My friends suggested that we go to Fu Lam Mum for dim sum. ?What a great idea, ?because I hadn't tried this place even though it was 10 minutes from my house. Upon entering, we were promptly seated and served tea. ?One thing that bothered me was that they kept talking english to me, ?I understand and can speak cantonese! ?The food was good and there were alot of variety. ?It could use an improvement on service. ?I ordered one dish that required a special sauce. ?I asked for it and she said no and took off! ?A good server would have gone and retrieved it for me. ? This place is good for dim sum but I don't know if I would come here if I had a choice between the Cupertino dim sum restaurants. ?I would like to try the late night dim sum. ?I would say this place is A-OK.

I was VERY pleasantly surprised by this place! A friend and i came here for dim sum on a weekday, and although they were busy, we were seated within about 5 minutes. I was impressed by the variety of items as they came around on the carts. I have a bit of a fascination with the carts,I find them exciting, and anticipate what they'll have on them.... It's kind of like opening a present. We tried several dumplings, and were happy they had all of our favorites: har gow, shumai, baked char siu bao, steamed char siu bao, scallop dumplings, taro dumplings, egg custard dumplings, they had everything! Even better, we loved everything we had. ( I was also pleased my fingers didn't feel like sausages after, as had happened at another dim sum place.) The servers were very nice, and kept our waters refilled, and brought napkins over immediately when i asked. Previously for dim sum, we had been driving all the way to Daly City. I'm thrilled to find such delicious dim sum so close to home:)

I've probably eaten at this place about 40 times or so, and every time I go there the food's consistantly impressive. ?I should note however, I only eat there after 9pm, when you can order off the cheap menu, AND if you order one entree per person, you get the free giant bowl of soup, of which there's at least 2 servings per person in there. ?I can't tell you what's in the soup, but it's one of my fav's there, and it's free! ? Also, if you see something you wan't that not on the menu, go ahead and ask, and they'll probably make it for you. ?Excellent salt & pepper fish!

I don't understand why just because it's dim sum, restaurants feel like they can charge up the ass for it. So yeah, Fu Lam Mum is definitely on the pricey side and their food really isn't THAT great. For the most part, most of our dishes were lukewarm, albeit quite tasty (they have some damn good shrimp dumplings and shrimp in rice noodle). The other dim sum items were a hit-or-miss: I wasn't too impressed with their chicken feet (the staple of dim sum on which I judge all dim sum restaurants) and turnip cakes. I was disappointed that they ran out of egg custard tarts (which I was like "WTF?! If anything, you should ONLY have egg custard tarts. What kind of dim sum joint runs out of egg custard tarts?!) The place is INSANELY clean for a dim sum place (granted that it's a new restaurant, so maybe I'll judge that in a year or two after it reveals its true colors). It also wasn't too crowded when I went on Saturday at noon -- very surprising for a dim sum place. They also service dim sum items at night too, so I may have to pay this place a visit if I need some chicken feet at 9pm. All in all, it has its ups and downs. The service wasn't too bad and it's a very sanitary place to eat dim sum. Unfortunately, the food was overall mediocre and the prices are a little pricey. But seriously, you really can't find too many great dim sum places in the South Bay without having to wait for 2 hours while the 50-year-old hostess screams at you in Cantonese, so I'll probably stick with Fu Lam Mum if I ever want dim sum in the South Bay.

[Author's note: this review is only for the midnight dim sum.] Thank you, Yelp! ?(I first heard of Fu Lam Mum's late night dim sum because of this website.) One of my concerns about moving to Silicon Valley was that I'd miss the variety of restaurants open late. Well, Fu Lam Mum helps fix that. Their late night dim sum only deserves 2 or 3 stars if we're talking about the food quality, but they get an extra star(s) for offering dim sum so late (e.g. after hitting a couple nearby bars). As others have noted, it's a limited menu this time of night, but I'll take what I can get.

Terrible service, blah to average dim sum. Sat through the entire meal without being served any water/tea but still got charged for it.

I'm so glad I finally made it here. After recent visits to OTHER dim sum houses, where I encountered inattentive service, run-of-mill selection, and dim sum that was often cold & lacking in flavor, Fu Lam Mum, was a dramatic & welcome change! The space is large & inviting, and on a recent weekday lunchtime visit, we were greeted & seated immediately, and offered our choice of teas. ?The dim sum carts came along promptly, with "pushes" who were friendly & helpful, but never "pushy." What we ordered: Har Gau/Shrimp Dumplings: Really nice, not one of those with a tiny bit of shrimp and a lot of doughy filler. ?This was how it should be. Siu Mai: Delicious! ?Hot, flavorful, and really nice texture. Xiao Long Bao: Tasty, but unfortunately all of the dumplings seemed to have already lost their soup. ?Better than the ones I've made at home, though! Chicken Feet: Hot & delicious, they danced right down my throat. Radish Cake: Cooked on a rolling grill at tableside, as they should be-- but unfortunately, not crispy. Next time, I'd ask the server to make them extra crisp. Rice Noodle Rolls with BBQ Pork: Hot & tender, and the pork was delicious. ?Also available with shrimp or beef. ?I'll be looking out for the ones with the Chines doughnut inside! Egg Tarts: Not my favorite. ?They were pretty and not eggy or bad, but their flavor was just kinda "there." Bland. Shrimp & Mango Rolls: The main disappointment of the meal, these were actually served QUITE warm-- but the mango was bitter, perhaps even pickled. ?Not like any I've had before, & I mean in a bad way. Overall impression: hot, fresh, and delicious! ?Well worth a bit of a drive! Other stuff: parking in Mountain View's Castro Street restaurant district is easy enough, with many public, free lots behind the blocks of businesses. ?Weekends on Castro Street can be PACKED, though! ?Just be patient.

I was excited about dim sum this past weekend as I have not had it since late August. ? My friends decided to come here at 10:00 for brunch and before the lunch crowd. ?We ordered the traditional dishes (Ha-gow, Siu mai, ha churn phun, deep fried shrimp balls, porridge, and the noi mai ga). ? I must concur with Kris H on the deep fried shrimp balls as they were fresh and got a serving of 4 compared to 2 at other dim sum joints. ?I also liked the noi mai ga (sticky rice with chicken wrapped leaves). ? As a consolation for the lack of flavor in their food, the prices were quite reasonable and they serve dim sum til midnight.

I gotta say Yelp let me down once again. I came here with the boo and his cousin for some late night grub. ?I really wanted some dim sum so we came here. Wish we had just gone to our usual Pho place across the street. Their dim sum menu is ok. Not too many choices and they didn't have most of what I go to dim sum for. The dumplings were good. Food was ok. Wish there was more variety to choose from on the dim sum menu. Service was WACK!!! They were soooo slow. I had to ask for spicy mustard 4 times even tho I saw them stand by the wall n watch the dining room right after I would request for some. The waitresses were also very snappy. Not nice at all. Border line rude. Their service sucked so bad. Our friend had treated us so he got the bill. Call me cheap, I don't care, bt I decided not to leave a tip since service was HORRIBLE. But they still got their tip. One of the waitresses came running after our friend yelling "TIP! TIP!!!!! WHERES MY TIP!?" & him being a weenie he shelled out $3.

I went here for dim sum with my friend Jocelyn who mentioned that Fu Lam Mum was a chain and should have good food. We only had to wait about 15 minutes, even though the restaurant looked packed. It had two stories so it was hard for the dim sum ladies to make their way to you. We had the same ladies come by with the same stuff every time. The only way to get variety was to flag down a server and ask specifically what you wanted, which would be a hard feat if you did not know Chinese. We had to ask to get ice water and tea. No one came by ask refill our water or give us sauces (usually at dim sum, they give you little bowls to put hot sauce and hot mustard sauce in). I thought the dim sum was typical. We had one server lady who was attentive and she came by to ask us what food we wanted because she saw that we kept looking downstairs. I don't think it was her job because it looked like she was mainly in charge of refilling waters and bringing out the tea. She made the experience worthwhile because she was so nice to us. But other than that, I would say that they have terrible service. I like Joy Luck Place in Cupertino a lot more.

Not to be cheap but this was an expensive Chinese restaurant! My aunt recommended coming here for our party and we missed the fun sum hours! They are lunch time, IT IS DIFFERENT FOR SUNDAYS, and 9-12am. We came at 5 right when they reopened again. We all ordered different things and they were fast but I've had better at cheaper restaurants AND whole in the walls. But it is a massive place, great for parties of all kinds. I wouldn't come here again until I came to all the other restaurants that I need to go to in downtown. The service was prompt and quick so I liked that.

2.5 for inconsistent product and service I know Fu Lam Mum doesn't care about my review, but I'm going to write it anyway. ?This place might be a staple weekend affair for the Asian community, but I find it sad that we don't have better options. ?Don't get me wrong, the food here can be good, but don't count on my loyalty if I ever find something better! ? The dim sum selection is decent--there are even a few things I've never seen on the east coast or in Hong Kong, like that strange dessert that looks like baked lasagna that I don't really want to try. ?But when I came at close to 12pm and there are barely any carts rolling around--my table of was hungry for basics like ha gow and shu mai, which is ridiculous. ?I had to ask 4 people in Cantonese to tabulate the check for me and it still took 15 minutes--ARGH! Also, they totally fell flat on my birthday dinner. ?All I wanted was a serving of yi-meen--longevity noodles. ?It was poorly presented and had two or three lumps of crab in it--old, probably frozen crab at that. ? TOTAL RIP OFF! ?Our creamy shrimp with walnuts were tasty, but missing the typical florets of broccoli for some color and balance. ? Options, I'm looking for options--suggestions very welcome.

I've never had a bad experience with the food, but tonight's late night "siu yeh" on the other hand.... They managed to run out serving spoons, water/glasses (?), and finally, waiters! After specifically asking for ice water when we placed our orders, it didn't come. We asked again. And again. Then our claypot dishes (read: STEWS) came with forks instead of serving spoons because apparently they didn't have any clean ones. Um, whaa??? Because we were STILL lacking water, we asked the food runner, who told us to ask a waiter instead. When we looked around, no green vest waiters were anywhere - they were upstairs having their dinner! I finally found someone to bring us some hydration when we were almost done eating. (On another note, these water glasses are stupid and tiny.) I've also booked a couple of large parties for dinner and had strange experiences where I make reservations for 27 people, and they give us 2 8-person tables. Maybe try going after 10:30 pm for siu yeh?

Food: 3 star Atmosphere: 3 star Service: 3 star My meal: Sizzling Chicken Appetizer: Pot Stickers I went here for dinner and ordered the sizzling chicken. It was alright. My only gripe was the amount of fat on the chicken. I'm OCD when it comes to fat on meat, I like to remove every shred of it. Doing so with chopsticks is next to impossible!!! The pot stickers, on the other hand, were really good. They had little shrimps in them. Yummy. My boyfriend's meal was also pretty good (sweet and sour chicken). One good thing is that dessert is free!! The atmosphere was alright. The restaurant is huge!! Two stories. Probably made more for the dim sum crowd. Service was fast at the start, then slowed way down afterward. We had to ask for the check. I would go back, but maybe to check out the dim sum rather than the dinner.

I met a couple of friends here for dinner tonight. ?I had never really hung out in this Mountain View area, but found that it was a pleasant area to be. ?Parking was kind of a pain, but the dining experience was decent. ?This would be a 3.5 star for me, but I'm rounding down here as it wasn't a extremely memorable meal. ? We had ordered a couple of dishes to share - the House Special Fried Rice, the walnut shrimp, the chicken clay pot, and the HK BBQ Pork. ?The house friend rice was loaded with a good amount of seafood toppings, and served as a good base food. ?The walnut shrimp was pretty good, and the chicken clay pot was pretty tasty too. ?I was disappointed at the BBQ Pork, which should be a staple item for these Cantonese places. ?The pork wasn't as flavored as I expect it to be, and there was more fatty meat that usual. ? The restaurant itself was very clean, so a plus there. ?The staff was friendly enough, especially for a Chinese restaurant. ?My friends there liked the food and think it's great, but I thought it was only mediocre. ?I'd come back here again if people wanted to eat here, but I wouldn't recommend it.

Summary of my 20-item late night dim sum review: the four best things in order are: 1. Shrimp and Pea Sprout Dumplings (flavor explosion - better than all other dumplings!) 2. ?Fried Green Tea Flavor Balls (sweet! and do not taste like tea) 3. ?Pork Ribs w/Rice Noodle 4. ?Fried Taro Puff Yes yes yes I did try the su mai, ha gao, and char su bao and no no no I didn't think they were special. ?You'll enjoy them as much as anywhere else but the above are where it's at! ?Oh yeah, I'm totally not Chinese or Taiwanese or Cantonese but my "authentic" friends approve of my hot list. ?Do I always sound this defensive?

Late night dim sum?!? My boyfriend and I ate here before heading out to Rock the Bells concert. ?The line was long to get in, but it went by pretty fast. ?We ordered a bunch of items (Crispy Shrimp Balls, Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf, BBQ Pork Buns, and Egg Tarts to name a few), and we were stuffed! ?They have a lot of dim sum to choose from and the price is very reasonable. ?And unlike any other dim sum places (or Chinese restaurants), you have 4 different teas to choose from. ?The service staff was great too. ?Even though they were busy as it is, they still took their time to answer my questions and very fast on getting us our drinks. As we were eating, we noticed that they also serve LATE NIGHT DIM SUM! ?I've never heard of such thing! ?We decided to come back after the concert. ?For $10, you can choose 3 items... not too shabby. ?And as late as it was, the service did not change. ?They were still just as nice as the morning. ?They let us stay as long as we want even if it was past closing time. ?Both the food and service made a great dining experience. ?Besides, who else has late night dim sum? ?=) TIP: ?The late night dim sum is not as extensive as their regular dim sum, but it's still worth the trip.

Bottomline: While not the BEST in the Bay Area and definitely not a destination restaurant per se, Fu Lam Mum is quickly becoming one of my go-to restaurants for dim sum and dinner with friends and family. ?I have been to Fu Lam Mum (the renovated one) many times for dim sum and most recently for dinner when all other restaurants were closed for Easter. ?*I understand Fu Lam Mum back in the day in the old location is quite ghetto. Why I liked it: (1) You can make a reservation (even for dim sum) - which makes planning for group gathering way easier than most Chinese restaurants when you have to risk waiting for hours if people in your party is late (e.g., Koi) (2) Food quality is decent - agreed with Randy F, quality is not on par with HK Saigon but if you are seeking dim sum and not wanting to drive all the way to south bay, this is a decent alternative. ? (3) [Semi] Healthier customizations available -- went there for dinner and I asked for everything to be 'low oil, low salt and no MSG' - I must say the dishes all came very light so I didn't feel completely grossed out after eating it. ?(Also next day with the left overs, there isn't a deep pool of oil in the bottom of the takeout box) Areas for improvement: (1) Services could be spotty -- this happened a few times - we arrived early for dim sum and when there weren't that many people, services were great and prompt. ?However, when the restaurant got busy, services literally fell off a cliff - it took 3 tries to get water/tea refilled and the check took forever to come.

I had lunch here yesterday w/ my cousin and her roommate. ?We got there at about 12:40PM, and we were told it was going to be a 15 minute wait (we finally got seated at 1PM). ?Did it live up to the hype, and was it really worth the wait?.. hmm.. no... but I'll get to that in a lil' bit. ? During the wait, we walked down the street a couple blocks to chop it up w/ the protesters in front of the Scientology office. ?The people had interesting signs and pamphlets, and they were all wearing masks (V for Vendetta and Transformers). ?They were blasting some interesting music and saying that "Scientology is a cult".. .stuff like that... interesting perspectives. ?Anyhoo.. back to the review of the restaurant. So, we only had a party of 3 people, yet the management was seating larger parties of 4 and 6 before us... I'm sure it's b/c of the way they have a certain number of tables w/ certain capacity... still, it would've been nice if they made that clearer before having us wait for that long.. ?Also, we were seated on the second floor, and it seems a bit silly, b/c they had to bring up the food via the elevators... would be more efficient if they made the food on both floors... The dim sum was aight. ?About the same quality as other dim sum restaurants. ?Bill came, and it ended up being $13/person.. a lil' bit more on the pricey side.. hmm.. perhaps it's b/c of the location and higher rents.. who knows.. (fyi, I eat a lot more dim sum in SF and it ends up only costing $8/person). ?Overall, I guess if you don't have a car or access to SF or San Jose, this place is decent for dim sum. ?But next time, I'd rather stick to the faster, cheaper dim restaurants in SF and San Jose.

I've been here quite a few times with my family and I can definitely say that the service isn't as bad as other reviews may have said, but you do need to repeat requests 1-2 times. The dim sum is not bland at all. It's actually quite good. Late night deals are the best, where you can get three dishes for a relatively low price. Note: It probably helps if you know how to speak Cantonese.

I can only review the dim sum, having never eaten here for a regular meal, but the dim sum is great. I used to figure you had to go to San Francisco for decent dim sum, but this is easily as good as many of the places in Chinatown. The staff is courteous and friendly, though as is typical of dim sum restaurants many of them speak limited English, so your experience will be better if you bring an experienced dim sum eater who knows what all the dishes are. The char siu bao are absolutely fantastic, as are the siu mai, and I've never had anything there that wasn't at least good, sometimes great.

When I first went for the Chinese restaurant, it was really good. I went back today for a dim sum lunch. It was somewhat disappointing. I mean, the food was okay...but it was 2 pm and the restaurant was still crazy busy...so busy that I never really got to eat anything. I got to eat like, maybe 4 or 5 dim sum during the whole time I was there. I think there was like 5 minutes or more between the dim sum options coming, and they don't use carts - they just carry trays around and it takes forever to get to you. And we ordered a beef chow fun because we were getting tired/hungry from all the waiting, and THAT took forever (and multiple proddings) to get to us. The beef chow fun wasn't the really the best either, but I've had worse so I won't complain. All in all...I don't think I'd go here again for dim sum, unless I don't have a choice, haha. Maybe they're faster with larger groups. It just seemed like nobody was bringing any food our way anytime soon! We had to flag the waiters down so often...they were bustling about like crazy! I think I'll just stick to Cupertino and San Francisco for dim sum.

Ever since Ranch 99 opened with its nifty dim sum counter in Mtn View, we haven't really felt the need to go out to a restaurant for dim sum. But ?we've now decided that the $10-for-3 late-night deal at FLM is, value-wise, as good if not better. For $2.20 at Ranch 99 you get three of anything, and it may or may not be fresh or hot. For $3.33 at FLM you usually get four things in an order, and it's piping hot. Not bad at all.

I was looking for great Chinese noodles in the area and when talking to a friend about my disappointment with Su Hong she referred us here. We went on Friday night and were seated right away, surprising as the place was very busy, but it is very large. The waitress made a couple of recommendations that were great (1/2 chicken and soup.) And the noodles were amazing, you could tell they were hand made. ? The service was fast and efficient! Very Good and reasonably priced. We will be back!

I came for brunch with 6 friends. I had only been here twice before, once for dim sum on a weekend, and once late at night (I have a previous review for the latter, and am writing one for what happens when not late at night, since the two are starkly different). As is standard with dim sum, people walk around offering dishes and you select what you want. We didn't actually get offered any dim sum until about half an hour into the meal - we were eagerly watching the cart for about 5 minutes beforehand. The brunch didn't really start until after we ordered several dishes from that cart. I personally felt like they were lacking a bit in variety. This was compounded by the fact that some people offered us the same dish at least five times, while some people only came to us once. This actually had me thinking of how to solve minimum cost multi-commodity flow problems efficiently (not something you want to do while eating brunch). The meal was slightly more expensive than I would have liked. I would only come here with a group of people though - there was a lot of talking going on while we were waiting for certain dishes to be offered to us.

As soon as my friend and I walked in around 11:45PM we were told to rush our order since it was close to 12AM (closing time). The manager (or whatever he was) literally said and told us to "Hurry". ?I actually called that night 5 minutes before we decided to go to that restaurant and asked if they were still serving food and he said yes. We had our first order served to us and then he gave us the bill and told us to pay first then eat later. ?I think he thought he was being funny --then he said that he had to close the cash register. This place was straight up rude and if I wasn't so hungry, I probably would've thrown it down but I didn't mind much at the time because we were in a hurry too. This is what we ordered: Fried Taro Puffs: Filled with taro and ground beef. ?This was too oily -even inside the filling part. It was good enough since we were both hungry but would've been better if not so oily. Steamed Rice in Lotus Leaf: This was good, filled with duck egg yolk, Chinese sausage, and a bit of ground beef. I would probably order this again if I was to come back. Shrimp and Pork Dumplings: It was a bit on the dry side but taste was mediocre. Shrimp Dumplings: This is also on the dry side but taste was decent. Steamed Egg Custard Buns: This was nothing special, standard all around just like regular dim sum places. Deep Fried Shrimp Ball: This was tasty --no big complaints here. Now that I've been to this place I am definitely not ever coming back. ?The prices were not very reasonable either: 3 items for $9.99. ?For what it was it was definitely not worth it.

Dim sum review only: Props to Fu Lam Mum for being open when most of the rest of Castro is dead. For $10, you can order 3 items off the late-night dim sum menu, which is an okay deal, considering the fact that this place is on the pricier side. I think the late night dim sum, though more limited in choice, is actually better than weekend fare, because the dishes come straight from the kitchen rather than from carts. Weekend dim sum is still decent, though, especially for Mountain View (seriously, there are no good Chinese food places here). I'm partial to the luo mi ji (sticky rice in lotus leaf), and I like most of the sweet options. Service is definitely iffy, but on the whole, this restaurant is pretty solid.

Fu Lam Mum is your average dim sum place in the Peninsula.... noisy, crowded, and slightly overpriced. We got the usuals - shrimp dumplings, chicken feet, jie4 lan2 cai4, pai2 gu3, shrimp chang2 fen3, and egg tarts. What marred our experience here was the fact that we got relegated to what I call the Food-less Corner of Doom. They have this 2 person table tucked away in a crowded, claustrophobia-inducing corner of the 2nd level, where you end up sitting side by side and facing a wall/column while you eat. The worst thing about the Food-less Corner of Doom is just what it sounds like - most carts don't make it over to the food-less corner of doom (or when they do, you have to keep turning around to see what they're serving, since you're both facing the wall). ?We ended up having to flag down waiters repeatedly in our desperate attempts to get noticed (and ended up having to order our food via a server more than once, since our order wasn't put in). Fu Lam Mum, please don't try and squeeze anyone else into the Food-less Corner of Doom, since any customer who has the misfortune to spend a meal sitting there is not likely to want to come back in the near future.

Fu Lam Mum was buzzing with excitement of yummy dim sum this Saturday afternoon. ?It was realy crowded and we were lucky to get a table within a few minutes of coming. ?Once we sat down, the dim sum carts started to arrive. ?Pure deliciousness! ?My advise - stay away from the desert cart and concentrate on the variety of dim sum. ?The deserts were so oily, I could't taste anything else. ?This is not a fancy place and a lot of servers didn't speak much English. ?Also, watch out, the ladies serving dim sum can be pushy! ?:-) ?I almost have to wonder if they get paid more if they sell more food.

I've been here twice. Both times a long wait to be seated. We sat downstairs once and upstairs once. Why it deserves only 1 star... poor service, lack of food, and average tasting dim sum. The staff here is sooo unfriendly, except for ONE person who brought us tea and was prompt about our requests for condiments. In addition, there was very limited amounts of food. There was ONE DIM SUM CART for the entire upstairs, which only had a few selections. After eating a 3-4 plates, we were hoping to see some new items, but it took about a 15-20 minute wait for anything new to surface. Moreover, when we asked our waiter about it, he was like we only have one dim sum chef. Well, that's ok, but that's not really our fault. After waiting a total of 30 minutes, we had had enough and just left. The very little food that we did try, we weren't that impressed. I wouldn't recommend this place.

I don't even particularly love dim sum, but at 3 dishes for $10 after 9pm, this place gets packed. It's offered daily, with choices like the typical shrimp dumpings (xia jiao / ha gow), shrimp and pork dumplings (shao mai / shu mai), egg custard tarts, porridge, scallion dumplings, taro balls, chicken feet, the bamboo wrapped rice, etc. ? They have all the standard dim sum things plus a regular Chinese food menu (cantonese stuff, so things like salt and pepper pork, chow fun noodles). Dim sum is probably not the best option for vegetarians or non-pork eaters. As with most Chinese restaurants, don't expect great service (sometimes you have to remind them about dishes, ice water, etc), but to their credit, it's a very busy restaurant, especially after 9pm. What happened to the days of $1.50 dimsum? ?:P ?This is no Koi Palace or Asian Pearl, but where else can you get pretty cheap late night dim sum?

F*** Yeah! I tried the Har Gaw, Si Mai, Pork dumplings and Walnut Shrimp! (they have this as a dimsum dish) I would rate the dsum at about a B. It really hit the spot while we were trying to find the rest of our lunch group. haha. From the $8 lunch menu, I tried Ma po Tofu. I'm addicted to it. It was just the right amount of spicy.

So I've given this place 4 chances, for 4 different types of dining experiences. 1. Lunch Dimsum - You saw my previous experience. The service was horrible.. to the point where we could not order or get our food. 2 . Evening Dimsum - Let's just say our food came at luke-warm temperatures, and service, even with less people, was still bad. 3. Evening Dinner - Lunch menu 'special' is now $8 instead of the previous $5-$6, and quality has gone down. Soup is no longer included either! My braised tofu and fish was not braised. It was str8 up fried and drenched in sauce. The fish was hard on the outside - abnormally hard, and inside was mushy. Horrible food. 4. Dinner (formal) - Dishes were over-priced, took forever to be served, and portions were small. The taste was decent, but given all of the above, not recommended either. I want to like this place since it's so close to where we are, but I've tried it time and time again, and it never fails to fail :(

Wow Is what I can really say. I don't know guys, I've been to some pretty decent dim sum places around town (not really) and when my aunt decided to take me, my sister and cousins to this place I didn't really expect much - particularly because I'm used to going to one dim sum place. However, coming to this location was a very pleasant surprise. Very clean interior which sounds irrelevant, but when you're sitting down enjoying dim sum, the last thing you want to see - let alone think about - is "I wonder if the food they're making is sanitary..." Let it be known that I did not think of that at all. Restaurant has a very clean look and feel to it, kind of too modern for my taste; however I did enjoy the all important tank of lobster and sea...food... stuff... animals... whatever. Moving on to the food (shamefully, I'm Chinese and am unable to even identify the foods with the proper name so please forgive me), it was pretty damn good. I'm a sucker for dim sum places that serve good chicken feet, and this restaurant is in the conversation for top three best dim sum places with chicken feet. It's not too stale or bland. It has a good balance of spice and kick to it, without being overcooked or even undercooked. Another one of my favorite is the... *damn* rice.... noodle... that's filled with BBQ pork. Damn, that was a mouthful (that's what she said) but it's the dish that has bbq pork wrapped inside a rice noodle, there are roughly three large pieces that are cut into smaller segments and marinated in a dark sauce (and it's not soy sauce either you jerks). So I kind of use those dishes to gauge whether or not a restaurant is successful... Verdict? Successful! Pros: nice clean restaurant, very nice workers, great chicken feet and rice... noodle... bbq... pork..., tea, not too busy during mornings Cons: kind of trying too hard (it is downtown Mountain View), parking is obscured and sucks, prices I guess....

This is probably the best dim sum restaurant between Millbrae and Sunnyvale. Their dim sum is always fresh and served hot. They have the run of the mill Har Gau, Siu Mai, rice noodle rolls, chicken feet in black bean sauce, etc.. They also have pretty decent "ginger vinegar". The wait can be long for lunch on weekends. They are open for late night snacks. their prices are reasonable.

For most of its long history, Fu Lam Mum "Sea Food Restaurant" was in a different location (until fairly recently, 246 Castro, where Pho Garden is now). ?Many locals associate it with those days. ?In 2008 it moved to much larger custom quarters at _155_ Castro (more below about that address) with vaulting ceiling, upper loft level, and much larger fish tank, and began serving dim sum tea meals in vast numbers -- especially on weekends, when it's popular and crowded. ?Less busy (and less selection, and less frequency of batches from the kitchen) typical weekdays for lunch exc. maybe Friday, the traditional lunch-out day for silicon valley employees. At busy times, the flavors and atmosphere (and noise level) remind me of old HK (whereabouts the cuisine originated), where everyone always wants to go out to "wan cha" (take tea -- with dim-sum, naturally) at any hour on any excuse. Not half bad either, in my dozen FLM experiences so far. ?It became one of the Bay Area's "destination" dim-sum houses, mentioned by regional online food pundits and drawing customers from well outside MV. ?The dim sum is also good for take-out, with the vast city mid-block parking lots behind it (an option missing from the "business info" parking poll here, but common to all Castro-St.-area restaurants). Besides the dim sum selection on circulating carts, FLM offers a range of house specialties especially with noodles. ?Fine and satisfying, if not notably unique, in my experiences of a few of them. Minor street address quirk: ?Initially the new location was always "155 Castro," as it still appears many places online. ?Yet today the business card says "153 Castro." ?I checked in person, and FLM's actual entrance has no number that I could spot anywhere. ?But to the left, an entrance to other tenants in the large building shows "153" so maybe that's used for easy recognition. ?About as many Google hits come back for FLM in MV at 153 as 155 Castro. ?When I asked a server today for the street number, she just shrugged.

Went there with family, had the dim sum. Dem's some good ass dim sum here!!! The price went up with the move to the new location, but so did the space, cleanliness, flavor, and quality of everything. You guys are snobby as hell in the bay area but I come from San Diego and this is some of the best dim sum I've ever had, and I've been to HK more than a few times. Really clean, and everything tasted super legit. Shumai, Har Gow, XLB, Char Siu, Taro buns... amazing. Way better than the old joint, and it's huge and well staffed so the service is good too. I could eat here every day. One of the best restaurants in Mountain View for sure.

I'm a lazy driver... but going to HK Saigon Seafood Harbor in SV is well worth it compared to coming here. The dim sum here is not consistent... sometimes full of flavor... sometimes bland. Dinner is good but uber expensive. ?What? ?Are we in MV or PA? ?I think they are catering the prices to all the Google employees. ?=P ?Ha ha. The only dinner dish that stands out, that I'd highly recommend is the "e-mein" with scallops and crab. ?Not a lot of restaurants serve this style/texture of noodles... and theirs is pretty darn tasty. But I definitely cannot afford to eat here on a weekly basis!

This is a good dim sum spot and it is cleaner and more upscale looking than other dim sum places. The tables are more spread out too so you don't get claustrophobia from people all around you and dim sum carts wizzing past you. They serve all the standard stuff and they are all good. A couple notable items to try are the sliced BBQ pork and the sweet green tea fried balls. They are similar to the fried balls coated in sesame but these are green (duh) and are filled with a red bean paste (I think, it's been a while).

Trust is a fickle thing. It can either comfort, denigrate, or break a person's resolve. ?In my case, I've had to wrestle with the fact that being quite intuitive can visualize many purposely hidden characteristics under the skin, which of course can further chip away at such trust. ?Since several levels of dating trust have been broken lately, I've had to apply such techniques when out on a food romp of sorts. Cities are a veritable culinary playground when it comes to meal times. ?The game is on, stemming from a few well placed coins down to several inches of plastic. ?Since my dating experience spans a section of the taxpaying class, I've had my share of Michelin rated linen topped dining down to the old hole-in-the-wall counters that are lined thick with aging grease and character. ?Nowadays, pomp and expensive restaurants deter rather than attract. ?I'm happy at the cheesiest and cheapest Chinese restaurant on Clement: one entree dish is approximately $5 and comes appropriately fatting out the dish. ? What I've learned is that anything on Castro in Mountain View is expensive. ?No thanks to the high rent and the thousands of tech/science inclined individuals that can afford to live in the area. ?In addition, since my good eating citified arse has been spoiled in SF, I find it hard to justify paying anything over $7 in such said Ethnic cuisine. ?I was a bit apprehensive about Fu Lam Mum, just by peering at the menu, but since I was visiting a very dear friend of mine, nothing mattered more than his company and sharing dating woes during the invaluable conversation of catch-up. Fu Lam Mum is typical that of large dim sum houses: white walled, rowdy, lacking character, and flashy in accoutrements. ?What makes one overlook a boring attitude was the fact that the tables were packed, despite the high prices. ?In the end, since the menu is quite extensive and we were both not really packing much of an appetite, settled on Moo Shu Pork and the Singaporean style rice noodle dish. ?The Moo Shu filling was great, with the right amount of savoriness as imparted by the shredded pieces of pork, mushrooms, onions, and cabbage.....but we were disappointed by the dry, crackly nature of the pancakes. ?Most of the pancakes I've had were supple, moist, yet typical of the think character of the style in which they are served. ?Our pancakes turned crunchy by the time we reached the 5th one and by then, it failed to hold any of the filling because it simply cracked apart. ?The Singaporean noodle was anything but just reflective of the original noodles. ?It lacked taste, despite the plentiful amounts of veggies, sliced ginger, and pork....so much so that we ended up spooning bit of the Moo Shu hoisin sauce into the noodles for more flavor. I would definitely come back for the Moo Shu in the future and request personally that the pancakes not be as brittle, advise not to order the Singaporean rice noodle dish. ?Stick with the traditional specialties, such as their Peking duck, braised fish (the flounder looked amazing) and chow fun dishes, and most importantly, hit this spot for their late dim sum hours of 9:00 p.m.-12:00 a.m. where the Chinese tapas style of serving tidbits is probably their saving shining star. ?Good ambiance and the wait staff were attentive. I would personally hit the dim sum markets on Clement and purchase my own Peking duck and appetizers for under $20......and have leftovers to spare. ?Trust, fickle indeed. ?The other type associated with dating? ?He's still working on it.

Food ? ? ? ? ? ? ? * * * * Service ? ? ? ? ? * * Price ? ? ? ? ? ? ? * * * * Cleanliness ?* * * * Parking ? ? ? ? ?* * * * Came here with my bro-in-law. ?We actually walked by here the day before and saw a fairly large crowd outside the restaurant. ?We figured it had to be good, to see this many people waiting to get a table. We came on a Sunday around 10:30am. ?Not sure when they opened but it was fairly empty. ?Complete opposite of what we saw the day before (I was a little worried). ?There was nothing to be worried about though, because not soon after we started eating, more and more people started to show up. ?I wonder if the dim sum selection is different on Saturday vs Sunday. Something I recently learned and never seen noted is that some items like Chinese Broccoli and Duck is served at later times, depending on where you go. ?In this case, Duck was starting to come out while we were finishing up. ?I was sadden by this, but stuffed none the less. The Dim Sum was very good as well as the selection. ?We had to ask for the spicy mustard and dipping dish, which I found to always be typically on the tables at other places. ?The Dim Sum waitresses weren't very attentive and don't speak very good engrish. ?Yes, I said engrish! So, it was a bit difficult trying to describe what we wanted. Overall, I would definitely come back again. ?Food is good, place is clean and the price is right!

Pricey, but you get what you pay for. The restaurant is clean, which is a HUGE plus for me (unlike many other dim sum shops I've been to), and the food is good -- actually, the dim sum is "pretty solid" to quote a fellow reviewer. Water doesn't taste like tap, and I'm very comfortable with bringing friends here for their first dim sum experience. No dirty plates, pushy servers. They cater to the area. I really like their ha gao, sui mai. Porridge was definitely bland and a little too liquidy for my taste. Late-Night Dim Sum is $10/3 dishes, limited selection. Not as good as morning dim sum, BUT great stop for a meal in case you've missed dinner. Tips: Park behind the restaurant if you can, come before 11am weekend mornings to get seated (fairly) promptly. Funny/Sad story: Remember that bland porridge I mentioned? Yeah, I tried shaking a little salt to season things up, but the cap fell off which resulted in soupy porridge with half a canister of salt. A little piece of my heart broke when that happened. Not so relevant, but thought I'd share.

They are slightly understaffed, but the waiter was very courteous.

Believe the one star reviews about this place. The service is non existent and the food is bland. My husband had to get our menus himself and after the 100th time of requesting for more water and a straw...I decided to throw in the towel and accept the fact that they were not coming by with any water or straws. And they never did. Dim sum menu is small and I had to add soy sauce to most of the dishes we ordered. Never ever again!

We came here with a gang of climbers for a late dinner after we left the gym. Pretty decent food that hit the spot and reasonably priced. We ordered eight dishes for the seven of us and it came out to $13 per person. Of course we stopped by Verde first for some PMT and it was no problem bringing it in. Service was slow because they seemed to be short on waiters. After we ordered though, the food came out quickly and steadily. Another good post gym option for dinner.

This restaurant was pretty busy on a Sunday night. I was surprised to see most of tables on the first and second level full of people! We went here for a banquet style dinner. The food was okay. Some dishes were better than others. 1) Appetizer Combination- had bbq pork, chicken, tofu bean curd, seaweed salad, jelly fish. This is the standard appetizer dish. As always, I love eating the seaweed salad! 2) Lettuce Cups with Chicken stuffing- Hmm.. the stuffing was plain without the hoisin sauce. It's too bad the chicken and other ingredients weren't flavorful since this is one of my favorite things to eat! 3) Steamed white chicken- Bleh, too salty. I felt my blood pressure rising after eating the chicken. 4) Fish maw soup- The flavor was plain. I had to drown the soup with pepper for flavor. 5) Sea cucumber with mushroom and bitter green leaf veggies- I love eating sea cucumber, especially when it melts in your mouth. However, it was very chewy. :( 6) Deep fry shrimp ball with scallop and pea pods- Yum! This was a good dish. I like eating deep fried stuff (in moderation). 7) Shrimp with walnuts- Woah.. these are huge shrimps! The mayo dressing was a tad too much for me. I just gobbled up all the walnuts. 8) Crab- It was a bit messy to eat, but it was decent. Kinda lacked flavor to me. 9) Fried rice- The rice was too mushy for fried rice. 10) White fish with deep fried bone pieces- MmmM.. the deep fried bones were pretty tasty! The fish was fresh. 11)) Dessert: Red Bean soup with corn- I've never seen corn in red bean soup before. The addition of corn gave a good texture to the dessert, and provided a more milky soup base. Service was nothing to write about. Our waiter tried his best to accommodate us, but he would forget the little stuff such as giving us bowls for the fried rice, ice water, etc. After 9pm, you can order 3 dim sum dishes for $10. Not sure how the dim sum tastes, but this is definitely the place if you want a late night dinner. The hard part is trying to find a parking spot along the street. However, there is a parking lot right behind the restaurant.

LATE NIGHT DIM SUM? HELL YA! Wow they serve dim sum until midnight. ?How AWESOME is that? The food here is good. ?If you are not sure what to order, ask for the picture menu! There is a lot of varieties here... from abalone to Swallow's nest... to dim sum... congee... YUM! Just super delicious and comforting food here!!!

My sister wanted to try Fu Lam Mum today since there's always a crowd for dim sum on the weekends. We arrived bright and early at 10am, but had to wait a few minutes for the doors to open. The restaurant itself is pretty large, and there are 2 levels. The decor is minmal and slightly modern. I suggest ordering the shu mai, sticky rice, custard bun, and egg tart. Although the chicken feet were huge, the flavor was lacking. Service was good and our water and tea were refilled without asking. Overall, the food wasn't amazing, but it was good. I'd return if I'm in the Mountain View area.

Meh. Met up with some friends after flying in late to California from Toronto, starving, and delighted to know that there was a late-night dim sum place less than a mile from my hotel. The good: it filled me up, their late night menu is "any 3 items, $10" which made it easy for us to explore, and extremely light on the pocket book. The standards were there, the service was reasonably prompt. The meh: execution. Shu Mai were small and bland. You can compensate with more vinegar, but Shu Mai are a staple, they should be bright and savoury. BBQ Pork buns were fine, but the turnip cake (I know, I know, Daikon cake) was another miss. We paid our bill and then headed up the street to Cascal to add some flavour (and booze) to the evening. Not a ringing endorsement. If you need dim sum after hours and are in the area, you can make it work. Get the fried noodles, whatever dumplings suit your fancy, and the pork buns and you will be fed for $10. But first ask yourself if it really needs to be dim sum; if not, Castro has better options.

I recently came here for dim sum on a Saturday morning. ?Downtown Mountain View is surprisingly empty on a Saturday morning, especially a Saturday morning of a festival weekend. ?We had enough people coming to dim sum that they were willing to accept a reservation for our group, and we were split between two large tables. I like the new, upscale look. ?It looks like it'd be a great venue for an evening gala event. ?(Well, perhaps if you covered up the fish tanks along one of the walls.) ?It's definitely a step up from the old Fu Lam Mum when it was more centrally located on Castro St. ? The dim sum was pretty good. ?There wasn't anything that was bad, but there wasn't anything that stood out to me as extraordinary. ?It was actually one of the cheapest dim sum meals I've had; it came out to $9.50 per person at my table. ?I think that might have been due to the fact that we had to wait for long periods in between food being added to our table. ?For some reason, the carts with food that we wanted to eat never quite made it around to our table. ?Thus, most of us weren't our usual dim sum-stuffed when we left. ?I think the trick is to just flag down one of the waiters and tell them specifically what we want so that they can go run down the carts for us. ?:-) Having a Cantonese speaker at the table is a big help; most of the staff seem to speak Canto versus Mandarin.

I project managed the installation of the operable doors in the 2nd floor a few years ago so I always point it out to friends who asked what type of work I've done. So then I also tell them of the delicious peeking duck tehy have in teh menu especially at the sale price of 14.99 before 9pm. The dimsum is okay but for being open fairly late in mtn. view and serving reasonable priced dim sum at that time is amazing. The staff sucks but for the convenience and the pricing, i will always go back.

A solid 3.5 star joint. Late night dim sum eats in MV? Wow, weird! But very cool and I'm stoked we didn't end up at HK Bistro next door. Walked into this place at 10:30 on a Sat night and it was bumpin'! Must've been some HK transplants. They have a large menu for being late night. We ordered pork & preserved egg porridge, cantonese styled chicken in a clay pot and the seafood pan friend noodle. Due to the fact it was later in the evening, I was surprised how fresh and hot the food was when it reached our table. The porridge was easily the best dish we ordered with lots of flavor although the pork itself wasn't that good. Loved that they didn't have hidden pieces of ginger that end up being like land mines rather than hidden treasures for me. The seafood pan fried noodle was excellent as well with lots of seafood on the top for $11. Super fresh tasting. The Cantonese chicken clay pot was the only semi disappointment to the night. It was not served in a claypot and rather in a stainless steel mini wok which made the dish dry when it should be nice and juicy in a clay pot. It was also extremely salty. Actually, all the dishes were extra salty but not offensively so since I have the salt gene. One guy was serving most of the floor but he was nice enough. Didn't make me feel like a dumbass because I don't speak Chinese AND Boo is white. Overall, a decent place and if I find myself out late again, I'll swing by here. Will report back once the dim sum has been had.

Certainly not the BEST Dim Sum I have ever had...but they're pretty consistent on the 'fresh' side of the fence. ?I don't know how the word really pertains to dim sum but the food always seems freshly prepared at least. ?One good indicator is that the wrappers stay right where they're supposed to - around the insides...and it's not freezer burn tough either. ?All said and done, it's definitely a dim sum stand-out on Castro St. Mtn View. ? The best spots I have found are still in the city - but you may have to battle your way in the doors lunch/weekends...unfortunately, cause it's the city - part of that battle may be with one of the sewer rats you typically find in SF too...

Thoroughly mediocre. Definitely edible but not a place to impress your taste buds. Pretty much slaps all the dim sum places in San Diego across the mug but can't hold a candle to most "nobody" dim sum spots in San Francisco. I hear Joy Luck is the better option in the south bay vicinity. The place has been recently renovated and is large, service is good and speedy. Early Sunday afternoon, our table of 6 were having a hard time getting some variety in what the carts trucked around though. Seriously? Sunday midday and rolling around the same few carts back and forth with the same old stuff? They have this amazing type of cart with a hot plate in it for making the carrot cakes and also the chive & shrimp dumplings table side. Sounds awesome, right? Looked awesome too. Too bad the taste wasn't. Maybe the food had been stacked on the side for long and the burner was on low - the food wasn't even properly hot and was extra oily looking. All that said, I wouldn't completely refuse to eat here again but the next time I'm on Castro I'd vote for trying something else first and fall back on this place if I missed dim sum or the other options didn't work out.

Went here tonight and I think I am in love!! We ordered -Crab and fish maw soup 3 for $10.00 Late night dimsum -Shrimp dumpling -fried glut. rice puffs -sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf THE SOUP WAS THE BEST I'VE HAD. Very light, with great flavor, perfect with a good amount of fish and crab. Dimsum was very delicious. I especially loved the fried rice puffs. Yummmyy there was pork in the middle too. =) Our waiter was a young asian guy who spoke really good english and was very friendly. Compared to other dimsum places the service was really really good. A little bit pricier than I'm used to but I will willingly pay that extra amount of money for the better taste and better service!! I want to come back for more... delicious!!! 5 STARS!

Fu Lam Mum's dinner entrees are quite good, for a somewhat higher than average Chinese food price ($12-20 per dish). Dishes we liked: - Grilled Sea Bass was a HUGE hit; large portion, enough to serve our entire table, and very tasty. - Bean Sprouts with Garlic - Beef Short Ribs with Black Bean and Honey Glaze - Peking Duck with White Buns and Plum Sauce Dishes that were just okay: - Beef Stew Clay Pot- It was more of a beef brisket with turnips in a watery soup. Decent flavor but definitely not what we were expecting from a beef stew. - Crab Meat and Fish Maw Soup was a little bit salty. Fu Lam Mum also offers complimentary green tea tapioca or mango jello for dessert. I really enjoyed the mango jello.

Super authentic food. I usually come after night for "shao yieh", which is kinda like a midnight snack equivalent, but with dinner courses for a cheap price. Fav food would be the deep fried "'fish" (i'm not sure what type of fish). My mom and dad would order it in chinese - so I don't know what type of fish exactly. Satisfying!

I like Dim Sum, but good Dim Sum places in this neck of the woods don't happen often. Fu Lam Mum is really tasty. I mean really tasty. The place ain't everything I'd want, but it's got some godo stuff going for it. The service is OK, twith a cycle time of about 10 miutes save for the simple starters which come around every five or so. The basics are done very well, especially the shu-mei (or however you spell it) and the pork bun. The Egg Custard dumpkings were magical, as was were both of the sesame balls they served. It was quite fantastic. The biggest problems I had were first understanding the accents of the servers. Some were very thick and we had to guess what we were being offered. The other problem were a few failures when it came to dishes that weren't typical. The shimp rolls were very plain, and I wasn't a fan of any of the crad stuff they brought around. Still, the place gets pretty crowded, but it remains pretty speedy. It did take us a while to get our check back though.

Standard tasting Chinese food with fairly nice service but its slightly pricey as Chinese food goes, average $15 per dish which tasted similar to the ones cost only half the price in Cupertino village. ?I guess we are paying for the service. ?The waiter was really attentive, and we almost never had to ask for more tea. ?Granted, his only job for the night was to serve us, since we were the only table upstairs. ?(16 of us squeeze into one big table) Thus, it gets a 3 stars for the food and 5 stars for the service, average to 4 stars. ?Order the claypots, they are the best dish here in my opinion, especially one with the oyster and seafood, they have huge oysters and scallops. ?However, the beef and pork dishes are pretty lackluster, and the noodles was pretty bland. I heard they have happy hour after 9pm for dim sum, maybe I will try that next time.

Late night dim sum... never a bad idea! Service was prompt and polite. Taro pudding and minced beef was delicious. Try the shrimp and pork dumplings!

If I could give this place zero stars, I would. The food was approximately Mr. Chau's quality, and the service was what you would expect in the Soviet Union. First of all, it's impossible to have a "nice" meal at this place. The management obviously is trying to squeeze every last penny out of the place, so they move people through like an assembly line. We had soup and five dishes tossed onto our table within three minutes. By the time our soup was finished, the other dishes were getting cold. The plates: we asked for regular size plates, but we were told that they only have appetizer plates. They have about a hundred glasses of iced water sitting out on the bar by the entrance, waiting to be served. In the meantime, all the people waiting in that area are talking right next to, and right over, the glasses. I'm not saying they drool into the glasses but it's nasty that little particles of spit from when they talk end up in the water. Animal cruelty: there is a huge fish in one of their tiny aquariums; the poor creature is nearly folded in half and cannot move at all, it just gulps water slowly. At least kill it and eat it, but don't let it sit there suffering. All in all, this place was horrendous. The building itself is nice, they obviously put a lot of money into it, but there are MUCH better Chinese places on Castro, like Yu Long or Queen House just to name a few.

OMG OMG OMG! So after a crazy ass sitting session from 4pm to 11pm next door at Neto to work on my crazy projects, I walked past this place on my way to the car and notice people! People inside! I'm thinking WTF? I check the sign and they are open until 1am Monday through Fridays! Holy cow Batman! I've found a new late night place. At this moment, I am sitting here waiting for my steamed oysters in black bean sauce to-go food. Yea, basically I will at seafood any time! Lunch special $8 from 11AM-2:30PM Items include shrimp, chicken, beef, tofu Late night dinner $8 Family style meals starting from $10 a person Will update after I eat the food but from the looks of it, pretty decent Chinese that doesn't seem too greasy for low prices. Woohoo! UPDATE: Pretty good oysters! I think the owner might have given me tofu as well because I couldn't decide. There was tofu, oysters, green onions, and garlic in a black bean sauce. I'd give it a solid 5 for this type of place if you know what I mean? Definitely way better because it is authentic and fresh, and not Americanized like..PF Chang's! Going back to try some more sometime soon!

Came here for dinner with my buddy. Arrived around 6 pm and got seated right in front of the door on the street level. (they have an upper level that was closed initially) Ordered a half chicken w/ Ginger and Green Onion ($12) and Garlic Snow Pea Tips ($15). Rice was $1/bowl. Service was typical Asian...my buddy ordered an extra rice and the manager told us that he would just give it to us for FREE...what a nice touch. Food was delicious and tasty. Portions were a little small and prices were leaning towards the high end. Oh, and they don't accept Amex...good thing I brought my trusty Visa w/ me as well! :)

Very good dim sum and a good value; four people for $50 with plenty of shrimp dishes and even Peking duck (Unfortunately the duck was skimpy and with very ?little meat). The service was good: The cart an carried tray service was prompt and frequent. Even the English spoken by the wait staff didn't make me feel too much like the ABC that I am. The dishes were all hot--which counts big for my dimsum experience. Overall I really enjoyed everything else though and would gladly come back.

Well what can you say I used to frequent Mayflower at The Great Mall in Milpitas when they were booming and still enjoy them from time to time for dim sum. ?I now found a new favorite place to eat dim sum in Fu Lam Mum the trick is when you get there order things you want off the menu I typically order my chicken fried rice with my drink so you don't have to wait long for the rice. I also ask for the pork spare ribs to make sure they come around. ?I also enjoy the walnut prawn option for dim sum at Mayflower you have to order a whole plate to get the walnut prawns since it is not a dim sum option. The two times I have been there they have been packed so be patient with the staff some do not speak English very well but try to be as helpful as possible. ?You really have to flag people down to get service but that is expected when they are as busy as they get. ?Raise that hand and ask for service or they will just keep on passing you by. The food was prepared perfectly each time we were there we had no issues with flavor or cold dim sum hitting our plates. ?Hopefully they keep their level of food up to par for years to come. As for now add this as one of my top 10 favorite restaurants. Most of the complaints I have read on here are just communication issues about closing times. ?Just try to get there way before they close so your not ?feeling rushed and enjoy you can your meal. If you are last minute expect the selection to be slim and service to be sub par since they are cleaning up for dinner transition or closing. ?Lets not let our lack of planning affect our opinion of the food or service. ?So is life.

I like Cantonese food but for many years I have been spoiled with delicious authentic food from Asia. I am very hard to impress when it comes to Chinese food. After hearing about this restaurant for a while I finally tried their dinner. At the end I was not disappointed. Fu Lam Mum is a pretty decent Cantonese restaurant. BBQ Platter (3.5/5 Stars) - Roasted duck has crispy skin and very good texture. Roasted pork is tasty but the texture is too soggy. I am not too happy with the huge amount of filler items (jelly fish and seaweed salad) on this platter though. For $28 price tag I really expect more than just a few pieces of the roasted duck and pork. Fish Maw and Crab Meat Soup (3/5 Stars) - I understand this soup is really not supposed to be too tasty. (Chinese people eat all sort of awful tasting stuff for the health benefits) I still think they can do better than this. The soup was rather bland. The same dish is done much better at Koi Palace. Stir Fired Tofu with Bok Choy (4/5 Stars) - Surprisingly good. The tofu is silken smooth and the sauce is tasty. Could use a little less salt perhaps. Pan Fried noodle with Black Pepper Beef (3.5/5 Stars) - Not the best black pepper beef I have had. I like the fact that the sauce was not too overwhelming. Unfortunately the beef was a bit tough. Fried Cod Fillet (4/5 Stars) - The fish fillet is moist, tender and cooked just right. The breading is a little too thick and end up being more chewy than crispy. Despite this minor flaw this dish is still very delicious. Ginger Scallion Chicken (2.5/5 Stars) - I have never been too happy with this chicken dish in North America. It might not be the fault of the chef. The chickens here are just not the same as those in Asia. The meat always appears to be dry and tasteless to me. Having said that, I still think this dish could be done better. Food wise Fu Lam Mum is really only about 3.5 stars. I do think it is one of the better Cantonese restaurants in South Bay so I am rounding it up. I like the clean and modern ambiance of this restaurant. The high ceiling made it much quieter than typical Chinese restaurants. Service was prompt and courteous. Came here on a Friday night for dinner and was pretty surprise there was no wait. I guess their dim sum is more popular than dinner?

I really like this place. I may even love it, BUT I can only stand it on very small doses. I do believe there is a time when one can have too much yum cha. I usually go here for lunch with the family or after work if I'm off really early. Their service is probably better than most dim sum restaurants-- but that's not saying much. Sometimes they close earlier than what their sign may say during lunch hours and even though you still have time to make it before closing, they'll rush you and even attempt to persuade you to eat somewhere else. Really now? Well too bad I'm hard headed and want my dim sum! Basically, this place is a little more over priced than most dim sum places you can find in the bay, but you hardly notice until the final bill comes out! But the quality is all there for what you're paying. The Fu Kin Fried Rice is what I alwaays have since my favorite place in the city has closed down. Just the right amount of everything in the dish and leaves everyone satisfied! The workers here all sorta look the same with the same hairstyles. (lol I guess they all go to the same barber.) ?This place does get crowded for lunch so come early or come late. I hear they have really reasonable deals for late night dim sum but I've never actually tried it. I suggest coming here with a group so that you get to try everything for a decent price!

This place is great for last minute meals with a large group of people. The facility is very large, with a downstairs that has small and large tables, as well as an upstairs that has nooks with even larger tables that can seat up to 15 comfortably. We arrived at 7:30pm without making any reservations. The waitstaff did not balk in the least, having us wait for about 10 minutes as they set up a room upstairs. We were the only party upstairs, which is nice considering the noise level in a Chinese restaurant is typically pretty high. Tea and water was promptly brought out. The hostess was very accommodating in helping us determine which menu items were vegetarian. Even though Fu Lam Mum is known for their seafood, they do have a fair selection of vegetarian options. The food here is less greasy than some other tried and true favorite Chinese restaurants. Their portion sizes are middling, not too much or too little. The quality is pretty good, as is presentation. They do have some oddities to their menus though. There were no vegetarian options for the soups. Even the hot and sour soup comes with seafood. Also, the hot and sour soup is REALLY quite hot, as there are little bits of red chili flakes throughout. Dishes I particularly enjoyed: - Potstickers: These were obviously house made. They were very large and juicy with just the right thickness of the wrapper. Nicely grilled on all sides. Served with a side of red vinegar - Honey walnut prawns: You can never really go wrong with these, even though it's not really a traditional Chinese dish. They shrimp were middling in size, but quite delicious. - Sauteed green beans: Tender and seasoned just right. - Fujian style gravy rice: This is like fried rice, but better because it comes with a delectable gravy over the top. The rice was interspersed with bits of egg, asparagus, shrimp, mushrooms, and chicken. - Home style tofu and vegetables: I like the fact that they make their own dofu pao, starting with fresh silken tofu and then frying it until it gets a nice skin. The best part about this restaurant is that they are open until midnight on weekends! Also, they served a tasty mango pudding for dessert. For a party of 15 people, we ended up paying $14 per person including tax and gratuity. I would definitely come back here if I had a late-night craving for Chinese food, or needed to feed a large group of people on short notice.

Are you looking for a decent dim sum lunch place? Then head on over to Fu Lam Mum! ?They will seat you quickly and within seconds wheel right up to your table with all the dim sum you could want and then some! ?Affordable prices, a nice setting, a staff aiming to please, Fum Lam Mum is a great place for lunching with your girlfriends or closing a business deal. One last suggestion: cap off your meal with a green tea pastry! YUM!!

Was craving dim sum & wasn't feeling like heading to Ton Kiang in SF - this Mountain View joint did the trick. It's helpful that we often notice this place is consistently packed with Asian-Americans :) ?and it's not called something like Henry's Garden. ?Plus my lovely Chinese friend told me her family ?who are recent immigrants favors this place. ? What we tasted: Fresh crunchy veggies on their dim sum carts, passably good dumplings, har gow you could eat by the dozen, decent variety, a typical loud dim sum place and nice enough staff that all seem to try real hard to please. Solid 4. ?I'll return :) ?Only problem is that when you're full, you need to flip your little paper over and leave quickly. ?The worst sounds when you're full is "Egg custard?" "You wan walnut shrimp now?" or "polk bun"

Overall: ?Could have been better, could have been worse. I was surprised by the service here. ?Usually big Chinese restaurants like these are comprised of efficient but swiftly rude servers. ?Our service was quick, food was out in less than 10 minutes (and we ordered A LOT of food for two people....yes, we're pigs!) and the various servers was very helpful and nice. ?Our host attended to us promptly and didn't have to wait too long on a Saturday night. The food we ordered was average. ?The clams were not as fresh as I would have liked. ?The salt and pepper fish was heavily battered with bread crumbs and tasted more like American fish and chips. ?The crispy duck was just meh, and the scallop fried rice was a bit bland. ? I can't comment on the dim sum today but i've had it before and it okay. ?This place is popular though so eh, go for it.

This is probably my favorite Cantonese restaurant. ATMOSPHERE: There is an entrance from Castro street as well as from the back parking lot. The location is great at the center of Downtown Mountain View. The restaurant itself is roomy enough that I've never had to wait. The look is minimal with the bare essentials. The decor is lacking offering offensive pink walls. The bathrooms are disgusting, much like gas station bathrooms. Despite all this (which is the only negative ?feedback I have on this place) it still deserves 5 stars. SERVICE: Fast to take your order and fast to bring out your food. The people are nice and helpful. If you ask them to suggest dishes, they are always happy to. They are open until midnight which is a wonderful service for those who need a late night meal after a night on the town. It is common to have porridge during this late time. MENU: A very decent menu with a good variety. Works well for vegetarians as well. They are always open to making the dish to your taste. FOOD: Yummmm. ?I have to admit that I have my regulars which are the Szechuan Seafood Soup and the Salty Chicken. The soup is a bit spicy, sweet, thick and tomato based with calamari, shrimp, scallops. clams, and shrimp. The chicken is a cold dish where the chicken is a pale color with skin and a salty sauce you dip the chicken in. ? VALUE: Great value. Everything is very affordable. OVERALL: One of my favorite restaurants. I've moved from Mountain View, but still come here from time to time for my favorites. I definitely recommend it.

I haven't been to the new location until now, and I've usually gone for dinner. The new place is nice, a large modern two-story corner location directly across from the cramped old hole in the wall. We came for weekday dim sum right as they were opening -- very nice to see that the food was already good to go. The food is not bad. Nothing said wow -- the flavors were conservative and traditional. No stand-out winners, but nothing that I wouldn't eat again, except the Shanghai Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) -- a dish 9.5 out of 10 Cantonese dim sum places murder. They were bland, dry, and the skin fell apart -- you get the idea. The sticky rice balls steamed in banana leaves could also be passed on -- dry filling, no stickiness to the rice. Considering the neighborhood and probably the 50 percent Caucasian/50 percent Chinese clientele, the dishes were a good compromise. I wanted to order the braised chicken feet -- not sure if they even served it -- but I didn't want to set myself up for disappointment. Service was brisk and inattentive, but the place was clean, and we were there early. The waitstaff stood around in the main dining room, chatting. I imagine by late lunch or the thick of dinner, service is much worse. Is it worth coming here for dim sum? There is no other game around, but it's not bad. I've definitely had far worse in many of San Francisco's and L.A.'s Chinese-for-Chinese dim sum establishments.

I came here twice on my trip to the Bay Area. Compared to dim sum places in Socal, this place is pretty damn good. I like the design of the restaurant. The two-story spacious place has these huge windows which light up the restaurant and makes it seem like such a lively place. The food is reasonably priced. It's great for large parties or if there's just a couple of you grabbing a bite to eat. I tried lobster noodles for the first time here and I have to say, YUM! The service is pretty great too. Last time I came here, it was for a really late lunch and the staff was clearing away all the small tables to make room for the bigger tables for dinner. The manager was kind enough to ask us if it was okay to move all the tables around us. I didn't even realize they were moving tables but it was so nice that they were so courteous! The only issue I have is DON'T GET SEATED IN THE CORNERS. With little traffic area, you're probably going to spend more time trying to wave down waiters than you are eating. The first time I ever came here, I was seated in the absolute corner where, only one of us would see if a cart would pass since the other person's back was toward the carts. This made it such a hassle to keep a conversation with my friend while being on the lookout for every damn cart. Don't get seated in the corner. I'm telling you, it's like the reject table.

Had lunch here to celebrate a friend's baby's 1st year birthday. ?They ordered the set menu and most of the entree dishes were good , except the sour item was the soup. ? How can you serve a tofu and shrimp soup and not know that the tofu has gone bad?! not a great experience with the soup and guess someone in our party mentioned it to the wait staff and got another shrimp and tofu soup but the first killed the experience. And we waited a long while for our cake to be served. ? And they haven't sliced it yet. ? It was the first time dining on the 2nd floor, but wished there were restrooms on the 2nd floor instead of walking down the stairs and almost getting running over from the staff when they come out of the kitchen which was nicely placed next to the women's restroom.

Went for dim sum with a party of 15 and surprisingly they had a table that would fit us all. So if you're going with a fairly large group ask to be seated upstairs. ?Also, sitting upstairs seemed like the dim sum carts came quicker because there were less tables. The dim sum was okay, but I've obviously had better in China Town (Los Angeles and San Francisco.) ?The thing that turned me off was the price. Didn't seem worth it for fairly so-so dim sum. ? The only reason why we even ate here was out of convenience. We wanted something near Stanford where we could fit our large group, eat right away (we were starving) and not spend a ton. ?I guess two out of three isn't that bad.

Wow, I'm giving the new Fu Lam 4 stars because of it's great ambiance. Also, the food felt much less greasy than the old Fu Lam of the past. The new Fu Lam is completely remodeled and redesigned. In fact, it's in a new location. Although this is not cheap for Chinese food, this place is definitely cheap by downtown Mountain View standards. Many places are quickly becoming a ripoff, but I'll say this place offers good service, decent food, and a nice ambiance at a fair price. We had both dim sum and some dishes there. All were fairly good. The shrimp dumpling (har gow) was good - the skin wasn't too thick, and they were fairly generous with their shrimp. We also had a fried taro ball - the filling was anemic and it was cold, but still quite good overall. The beef noodles we had were delicious. We ordered a beef and scallops dish as well as a fried pork chop dish. Both were good, albeit not cheap. Overall, if you're looking for decent Chinese food and a nice, clean ambiance, this is the place for you.

Let's start from the beginning...and progress :) Right when you walk into the restaurant, you can tell it is obviously clean. It doesn't smell (which is very important to me). I can't stand when Chinese restaurants smell like the public restroom or the stench of old carpet that needs to be replaced. And right when you walk in, the waiter or restaurant manager greets you and seats you. I usually go around 7-9pm for dinner so I don't wait at all usually but I do go later than usual diners. In any case, they seat you and you begin your dinner journey. Their menu is definitely a great compilation of popular and tasty Chinese food. The prices are actually quite reasonable, in my opinion they're good. For the amount and price, plus the quality, it is definitely a win :) Their menu has a variety of everything...from late night dim sum (which is awesomely priced at three kinds for 10 bucks after 9pm!) to beef dishes, seafood plates, and yes, friend rice and chow fun! And they also have dessert too if you ask for the nights dessert :) Aside from their menu, they also have specials too. Some nights there are awesome seafood specials. Seabass is usually expensive, like a twoish pound fish would be 30-40 dollars...when Rey have the special it is almost half priced :) the specials are posted in the front near the door and bar (yes they also have a bar)...so you cant miss it unless you're too busy enjoying the food. Now on to the service...the service is pretty good. The waiters and waitresses are quick to attend to you. I hate when I ask for something and they don't bring it to me in a reasonable manner. I don't expect lightening fast, but you know within my 5-10 minute span is more than enough haha. But the service is great :) WHAT I LOVE? well besides the food and service...I love the hours! They're open sooo late. Like past midnight late, like early mornin wee hours late. So when I need some food, like their awesome dim sum, I am there :) The only thing I don't like is the chili they use for dim sum. But I'm used to the super oily and unhealthy one...they have a less oily more healthy version haha But that's it, love this place. It's welcoming, definitely tasty & very family oriented! Perfect for the family or a date :) Oh and very clean and very modern looking! Plus it has two floors!

Actually, this place turned out to be a pleasant surprise. ?Archie R. took me here last year and I didn't even know it existed. ?Pretty good dim sum and reasonable price. I would suggest making sure you sit on the "right' side of the restaurant, i.e. check out the flow of the carts and make sure you sit where the carts go. ?If you sit on the "wrong" side, by the time the carts get to you, the good stuff is gone. ?I have had to literally order things when that happens, but they are accommodating and will bring dim sum orders to your table, so no biggie there. One extra for being nice. ?I left something in the bathroom this past Sunday. ?I called a few hours later and left a message to see if they found it. ?They did, and held it for me until I picked it up two days later.

Been to Castro many times and didnt even realize this large dimsum place existed! I guess externally doesnt really look like a typical azn restaurant. Decor is modern and very airy which I like with even a large 2nd level to seat more guests. Dimsum was surprisingly tasty..everything was fresh and quick. Although it was a Monday, it was pretty packed. Tea was genuine and service was above par. Only thing is that selection is limited..none of the specialty items that other large dimsum places have. Maybe on the weekends? Overall a pleasant meal on an otherwise scorching day in south bay!

Food was average since i come from LA usually so we have M Park and Rowland Height Dim sum which is not only 1/2 the price but better in taste. Fu Lam Mum is getting competition though from the restruant that been in construction around the corner. On Villa they just opened and they have a AYCE Dim Sum buffet going on at lunch now for 9.99 a person which...... is like 4 dishes in Fu Lam Mum so we will see if they lower the price to compete

This place is awful. I arrived around 2:30PM to grab lunch, and was rushed to a table and immediately harassed by 2 ladies with carts, yelling at me and pointing at food that was old and unappetizing. I ordered a few things, which I couldn't even tell you what they were (I had the manager recommend a few things). Everything was cold, slimy, and had no taste. To top it off, my shrimp wantons came, and the shrimp was gray and transparent. It was not cooked. I had to yell at them for these people to understand that the shrimp WAS NOT COOKED. Don't waste your time here.

When its past 9PM and we're still hungry... and the fridge is empty (I mean I'm too damn lazy to cook), we head out to Fu Lam to fill our tummies. I guess we've come here enough where the staff now recognizes us and they're really pleasant. Food has been consistent, I'm always ordering the tofu jalepeno dish and Hubsters loves their seafood clay pot. When we're super hungry we'll go for the scallop and egg white fried rice!

BF and I drove here from PA around 1130am and waited about 20-30 mins for a table. The best part about the wait was the load speaker system in which was used to call out numbers. Nice. ?The place is huge. There is an upstairs and a downstairs. Once we were seated, the carts arrived fairly quickly. We had to flag someone down for tea. Some of the food was good but my only complaint is that it wasn't hot enough. Some of the dumplings were cold. Other than that, no real complains other than the usual Sunday mid day wait.

We came here for dim sum on a Saturday morning and arrived just before the doors opened at 10:00. ?Interestingly there were a number of people waiting for the doors to unlock as well. The dim sum itself is okay but I wasn't particularly impressed. ?They didn't seem to have a lot of choices at the time we went there and it took quite a while for some of the carts to make their way around to our table. ?I had to ask twice for water and we had to flag down a waiter to ask for a plate of the gai lan veggies after it became apparent that the cart wouldn't be making it around to our table anytime soon. ? Overall it was okay but for dim sum I'd much rather drive further and go to Mayflower in Union City.

It was my very first time ordering in Mandarin for my two friends and myself! :D Usually it's my parents ordering for me in Cantonese. *phew* I survived and got the foods that I had wanted. :P Lunch we ordered: -har gow -shu mai -tsa shu shu (pork inside a yellow, flaky rectangular pastry dough and sesame seeds on top) -beef ball -fun w/ shrimp -shao long bao -sticky rice w/ dried shrimp, chicken, chinese sausage wrapped in banana leaf -steamed pork bun -bbq pork -egg tart Kind of pricey dim sums (compared to LA), but tasty and quick service! They only had like two pushing carts of dim sum and other items. =\ Dim sums and other cart dishes ranged from $2.75 to almost $7. For 3 people our bill came out to $43 w/o tip. It was a bit crowded here during lunch, but we got in and out quickly! Parking was insane in downtown MV during lunch at 12pm! We had to park all the way on Shoreline and Villa! O_O I will try to come here next time after 9pm for their dim sum special! :) Go green: take LTR Mountain View or VTA buses that head toward downtown MV

Four stars BUT ONLY WHEN it's lunch time, or after 9pm, which is when the special (cheapo) menu is available. ? After 9pm, they even give you soup with your meal -- soup made of an unknown animal and unknown fibrous vegetable. ?Skip it... your food will be plenty. Don't look at the live (non-ornamental) fish... they make me feel sad.

Reopened on Castro Street, Fu Lam Mum is a great addition to the culinary deights in this area. ?Nice and sharp new look restaurant. The food was very good. ?Went for lunch and ordered shrimp in lobster sauce off the menu(it was wonderful in taste), and then did the Dim Sum. ?I really liked the Dim Sum, especially all the dumplings. ?The Shanghai and shrimp dumplings were my favorite. Has a complete menu, with full bar drinks and is open late at nights. ?I enjoyed my lunch there very much.

The only real negative thing I can say about this place is that their late-night dim sum selection is pretty sparse. On a good note, they still offer their full dinner menu. I need to write an update for this place once I try their regular menu, but so far I'm happy. I really liked their noodle with sparerib dish, BBQ pork buns, and shumai. I ended up having an allergic reaction to the shumai, but that was my fault. I'm allergic to shrimp, and I think it's mainly in my head. So when I tried the shumai, I bit into it, and stared at the large pieces of shrimp. The allergic reaction was almost instantaneous. Next time, I'm just gonna pop the whole thing into my mouth like sushi, and ignore the fact that it contains shrimp. Kudos to them for being open til midnight. It's our go-to place for a quick fix late at night.

Pretty good dim sum. The wait always seems to be long. Good lo mai gai (lotus wrapped rice and chicken) Great do fu juan (tofu skin wrapped pork and veggies) Very attentive staff but you must show that you need something from them.

The dim sum is fine, but not great. ?I liked the rice noodles. ?But what really prompted this review was that the chopsticks are impossible to eat with! ?They have a metal ornament on the back that weighs down the non-eating end. ?My hand was tired trying to hold the chopsticks in place! Lesson: Bring your own chopsticks to Fu Lam Mum.

I'm writing this on behalf of my Chinese dad-in-law. He likes this place. And if he likes this place, that means it's the authentic, good stuff. He doesn't just go to ANY Chinese restaurant two days in a row. I've been to many dim sum places -- authentic or not, I'm usually satisfied. But yum yum dim sum is what I say for Fu Lam Mum! The big plus for me is that it was clean. Even the bathrooms. And I saw lots of Asian folk (1st and 2nd gen) which is always a good sign. On a Sunday, the place was busy with people waiting outside. We got there @ 11am and they just opened up the upstairs part, which is a little more roomy, but filled up quickly. So get there on the earlier side to avoid a grumpy tummy.

Update 5/24/08: I live a few blocks away, and I really felt like dim sum, so I decided to give it a go. ?My boyfriend and I were seated immediately. ?Then we watched the carts go by. ?The carts which had seemed so numerous when we were hungrily watching from upstairs turned out to be four carts: one with rice noodles, two steamed carts, and one with custard tarts and a few other random things. We ended up with six or seven baskets and plates, and all of them were unimpressive. ?Everything was lukewarm at best, even the plates that had just come out of the kitchen. ?Everything was entirely lacking of flavor. ?Even the sticky rice was bad, and I didn't know that it was physically possible to make bad sticky rice. ?They don't even fully wrap it in a lotus leaf -- there's just a bit of lotus leaf around the bottom of it, then it's wrapped in parchment paper. ?Only repeated applications of chili sauce gave this dish any flavor at all. ?The only item that didn't entirely suck was the steamed barbeque pork buns, but even those were dry and disappointing. Actually, "dry and disappointing" applies to both of my experiences here. ?I can't imagine why I'd ever go back to this place. ? ------------------ With the new location of Fu Lam Mum, I decided to see if they did dim sum on the weekends. ?One Sunday, I popped in. ?It looked promising: lots of people, lots of carts, long wait for a table. ? After the long wait, my party was seated upstairs. ?This turned out to be a mistake. ?One cart came by, and we got a plate from it. ?Tea came. ?Minutes passed. ?The same cart came by, offering the same items. ?Downstairs, we could see carts laden with plates and steamed baskets. ?Upstairs, it was the same angry-looking woman hawking chicken feet. ?Our one plate with sesame balls was lonely. ?We tried to get the attention of someone, anyone, but it wasn't any good. ?After 20 minutes, we finally threw some money on the table to pay for the sesame balls and left. I've been there for dinner and wasn't all that impressed, either. ?Service is slow, and meals come out whenever they come out. ?The dishes themselves are uninspired and lacking flavour. ?I've had better Cantonese at dozens of other restaurants on the Peninsula. ?But with it being one of the very few restaurants that are open after 9pm in this area, I'm sure that I'll end up back there sometime.

Delicious, I came here with friends late at night so they can have a nice bathroom to shoot smack. ?It's actually not that nice at all, but because of the fish tanks inside, they thought they were at the aquarium anyway. ?It doesn't matter anyway. I don't know what any of the dishes are called, besides describing them like, "the salty one with the meat bits." Or "the greasy one that made me piss out my butt last time" or my favorite, "the one with the green parts and the things." That one is delicious. Usually when I go I have a person with me that can speak in tongues to the wait staff. ?That's a really helpful addition, because our table gets better service, and it keeps the attention away from my deformed body.

They are slightly more expensive than the usual dim sum place but it's ok, I don't mind paying for the place to look new, nice and clean. Food is pretty good and portions are good. Their usual dim sum must eat (har gao, shui mai, etc...) is decent so I am not complaining. Been here for dinner too and it's was good food. ?I think their chefs are Cantonese from Hong Kong.

Came here for dinner since it seemed pretty popular at lunch time... it was a big mistake. ?The food during dinner time is really overpriced... the sizzling rice soup was $15!!! and it was pretty small and nothing more than the average stuff you get at a normal restaurant for $8. ? We also got the house special noodles which were decent but also kind of a rip off for $10. The worst part of this restaurant is not the food though ... it's the service... it is sooo freakin' SLOOOOWWWW. ?I think that's why it's packed... cuz it takes an hour to get your food.

They raised the prices of the late night specials to $8 with rice, but now without soup. Portions not big but very tasty. We had the fish filet with black beans (high quality fish, not cornstarched out either), and the cantonese style chicken with onions with was ever so yum, eyelashes fluttering... Interior is spiffy, and there's a wait staff that's still trying to get it together, yet big enough to get someone to do something for ya if you ask.

I took the light rail over to Fu Lam Mum today for dim sum. ?The close proximity to the light rail station sure beats circling up the parking garages to the roof. ?I have now had the opportunity to have both dim sum and dinner at this restaurant. ?I'd have to say they serve good, solid Chinese food. ?Nothing too special about it, but a good alternative to the other Cantonese restaurants in the South Bay. ? The ambiance was nice -- I definitely liked the open air feel of it. ?The workers must get a lot of exercise going up and down the staircase. ?The elevator for the carts is kind of oddly placed by the entrance of the restaurant. ?The only problem is the noise level. ?But then again, I can't think of a single Cantonese restaurant that isn't noisy. ?The restaurant was bustling but it didn't take too long to get a table for 9 after 1pm. ?It's a great place for large groups! The Har Gow and the Siu Mai were plump and very flavorful. ?In contrast, the egg custard (dan taat) was tiny, but at least it had the flaky crust. ?I really liked the Beef Chow Fun but the Chicken Chow Mein was really not very good at all. ?That was the only dish I disliked. ?With only the standard dim sum plates, the dim sum dishes lacked variety. For dinner, they had more variety of dishes. ?I had a really interesting one that I can't remember the name of but it was basically deep fried taro filled with a seafood mixture. ?The taro was kind of like a cross between a fried taro ball (woo gok) and a bird's nest and that served as a cup to hold the seafood. ?I really liked the flavors in that dish but I'm a real sucker for anything taro flavored. ?The other dishes were pretty good as well. ? I prefer going to Hong Kong Saigon for Cantonese-style food, but Fu Lam Mum is a good alternative especially if I want to take the light rail or if I want to get bubble tea afterwards!

Since it's relatively new, I wasn't surprised by the hoard of people who wanted their dose of dim sum during Sunday lunch. My friends and I went there during peak lunch hour on Sunday and only waited around 20 minutes to get seated, which wasn't bad at all. This place is definitely fancier than the usual dim sum joints, with two stories as well. Once we were seated, carts of food was brought to us right away so we did not have to wait at all. This place is somewhat more upscale than the usual dim sum places I'm used to going to, even the chopsticks were fancier! The dim sum tasted pretty decent, and fresh. I really wanted this sponge cake and asked the manager for it. He went in and came back out with fried tofu (on the house!) because they didn't have any sponge cake left. Five minutes later, he proudly walks back to our table and gives us the sponge cake, it's also on the house and he says he finally found some upstairs. Thank you, Simon, for you great service to us, we'll definitely be back.

Be sure to make reservations! Good thing my coworkers were smart enough to do so, as the place packed up pretty fast and there was a waiting line. The first time I went, it was pretty good! Lots of dishes, friendly service, piping hot plates. Second time I went, friendly service, tepid plates... And they're not very good at pacing the cart pushers. We got 5 people at once and then nothingness for another 20 minutes... And then they ran out of hakkgao (shrimp um legs? dumplings? Sorry. I fail translating.) They do have a good selection of vegetarian platters. Their dishes can either be right on or off the mark. Depends on the day, I suppose? Friday = busy = slow service and cold food. I went early on another day and the food came out fresh and service was better.

I'm a Chinese person from NYC originally and this place reminds me of a Chinese restaurant for Chinese people that I'm used to. That's something I haven't encountered yet in the west coast yet. Service sucks like in every Chinese restaurant for Chinese folks but I found the menu to be quite tasty. I came in for dinner with a friends and ordered pan fried noodles w/seafood, some beijing pork chops and walnut shrimp. Pretty clean and tasty with an overall enjoyable dining atmosphere. Lots of light and feels open and airy despite being inside. We ate downstairs and despite some of the sun getting in my eyes ?before I changed seats... had a good time. I'm probably gonna go back for dim sum sooner or later.

After the fantastic dinner that made me nostalgic (being from Hong Kong), I decided to come back here again to check out their dim sum. We went on a Sunday afternoon, after 2pm, so it wasn't too full. We ordered mostly normal dim sum plates, like Har Gow, Siu Mai, Roasted Pork Buns. I've been to other places, where when the dim sum time is ending, the food gets cold, but the food is still steamy hot at this place, although, selection wise, I don't have a lot of choices. The food was average, and I'd go to other dim sum places in the Bay Area if I'm craving good dim sum. Service was like any other Chinese restaurants -- half-baked, but if you can get their attention, it's not too bad.

I briefly heard from the host that this place has only been open for about six months, which is almost a surprise when considering how busy Castro gets around lunch. ?And for coming on a Tuesday, it certainly wasn't busy. ?I'd imagine that once word gets around, I would think that this place would get packed real easy. But for now, I am enjoying the lack of noise that usually disrupts conversations in other Dim Sum environments. ?In addition, the decor and service are quite friendly and modern to the customer's experience. ?Also, I can eat my food with enough space without bumping elbows with anyone else. Overall, this place is quite nice for the moment. ?Although I'd imagine that once it gets much more popular/busy, that the quality may take a different turn. ?Nevertheless, I should come back, perhaps for a late dinner!

After a very long night of driving, I was trying to figure out where to grab a bite to eat that was open but not In-n-Out Burger. Don't get me wrong, I love In-n-Out but I just didn't feel like a burger. I figured Moutain View would be a good shot so we drove down Castro and looked at our options. There were a bunch of people in Fu Lam Mum that were Asian, so that was a good sign. We went in and ordered three regular dishes (braised tofu, garlic eggplant claypot and pork porridge) and three of the dim sum specials (pork buns, tofu skin with meat, sesame balls). These hit the spot. Not the best, but fresh and good for the hungry. The porridge was seriously lacking any preserved egg or pork so that was a big disappointment. Everything else was okay. The pork buns had good flavor and so did the tofu skin dish surprisingly. Good for future reference and worth the 20 minute drive.

Great dim sum and much better than the one we tried in Vancouver, BC(Sun Sui Wah) and our normal spot back home in Seattle (Purple Dot Cafe). ? We've already been three times since we've been here and have been impressed by the great service (the hostesses even though busy have always been sweet and friendly with our 21 month old), the nice open air space (do try to sit down stairs), and the yummy dumplings. We really love the mango shrimp, shrimp and pea sprout dumplings, and Shanghai dumplings... we haven't had a bad dim sum dish as yet even though we've tried 2-3 new dim sum dishes each time we've went.

This review is for their dim sum. So, I heard from a few people and from reading their reviews that this place was really good for their dim sum. So, for a while it was on my bookmark of food to try. I finally got a chance to try their dim sum last Saturday and it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I thought it was just OKAY, nothing special about it. Tasted just like any other dim sum. I think Dynasty or even Good Luck dim sum in SF is better than Fu Lam Mum. ? We came around noon, which is probably on the late side for dim sum, so they only had a few carts going around at the time. They don't take special orders anymore either. Lame. They have $8 dishes after 9pm on their menu that I *might* want to try. The head waiter said that there were about 30 items, but it was more like 12 items. Maybe they have a secret menu? Whatever. I'm disappointed. Maybe good dim sum in Castro, but not good dim sum overall.

I came here for Dim sum once more recently and another time back in high school. ?Judging from my more recent experience I think that they do a pretty decent job with dim sum on the weekends. ?And for some reason most dim sum place such as this always seem to have their dim sum tasting the same as every other place like it. ?I suppose I've only tried a few places, but it maybe a good thing. ? The service seems to be alright, but they might not have enough space or carts going around... ?there definitely seemed to be a lack of space here. ?The tables are uncomfortably pushed too far into walls or other tables, which makes for moving around a pain. ?I suppose they pack this place to it's highest occupancy rate, but on a weekend day it's jam packed. ? Some people seem to think the dim sum sucks here, but I'm not quite sure I'd go that far to judge it's food to be that poor. ?Besides I'm sure I've had worse Chinese food in my life. ? Anyhow, it seems to be the only choice if you want to eat dim sum in a fairly large place with this type of style. ?Not exactly sure what your supposed to call it... HK style dim sum?

Went here with a group of coworkers today - first dim sum experience. ? The restaurant is in a great location in MV, and is HUUUUUGE. ?Much like a Brasil BBQ, the waitstaff runs around between tables with carts filled w/various edibles. ?As it was my first time, I have NO idea what I ate today (other than shrimp, pork, rice, and kale...oh...and a killer hot sauce). ?That said, it was FINE food. ?We had a group member who spoke Cantonese, which did make things a lot easier on the ordered, and he let us know what we were about to stick in our mouths BEFORE we did. :-) Overall, while a bit expensive for an MV lunch spot, it was VERY good, and there likely will be a repeat.

2.5 stars for Fu Lam Mum. ?We typically head to ABC Seafood in Milpitas for our dim sum needs, but decided to give this place in Mt View a try this weekend. ? It's a large dining space, so we didn't have to wait at all for a table for 8 at 11am on a Sunday. ?Typical dim sum service - no worse, no better. ?You wave someone over to get your tea, drinks, check, etc. ?They charge $1/person for tea (Really?! ?Come on...). ? As for the food, pretty standard fare with some notable exceptions missing. ? We had har gao, BBQ pork buns (dry w little meat), shui mai (the best of the bunch), scallion pancake (doughy not crispy), shiao long bao, rice noodle w shrimp, eggplant, egg tart, radish cake (gluey not crispy enough), dumplings. ?We were looking for pork spare ribs, almond tofu, mango jello. ?Their selection was less than ideal. ?The carts do come by with good frequency, so you aren't left sitting with time gaps with no food on the table. ? The bill came out to about $4-5 per dish. ?Still think dim sum is surprisingly rather expensive and substellar tasting in the Bay Area -- I'm open to suggestions!!

I know people say "I can't believe I didn't write a review for this place yet" a lot, but seriously, I could have sworn I wrote a review defending this place from it's 3.5 star overall rating! Fu Lam Mum's got it all! ?All the authentic Cantonese fair and dim sum you want. ?This place is huge, and with a menu to match! ?Not to mention they have a late night (9pm til close) menu with special discounted prices and late night dim sum, gotta love it. We even held our engagement party here with some close family and friends. ?We picked 9 or 10 yummy dishes per table and everyone loved the food. ? Some of my favorites: Mushrooms, tofu and preserved vegetables - vegetarian, flavorful, very interesting dish (not your regular boring good-for-you kind of dish) Any of the seasonal veggies cooked with fresh garlic - snowpea leaves especially! ?very fresh and natural flavors. ? Steamed whole fish - come on. The manager/owner is one of the friendliest guys too! Always makes me feel so welcomed. :) I took off one star because some "sauteed" dishes are unexpectedly fried.

I understand that I have been spoiled having lived relatively close to Chinatown in San Francisco and having also dined at fine dim sum places like Yank Sing and Ton Kiang, but I really did my best to try and enjoy Fu Lam Mum. In an attempt to focus on the positive, the fried taro and the shrimp wrapped in bean curd was very good, they promptly brought over hot mustard, and we ordered six different things and the bill came out to a little under $23 (not too shabby!). However, the pork buns were blah, a steamed pork dish we got was full of fat and bones, the turnip cakes were too greasy, and the sun was in my eyes for a good portion of our meal. Don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon for mediocre dim sum.

3.5 stars I was a bit suspicious of the new (and improved?) location of Fu Lam Mum, having been used to it being a nice, cheap eatery down the street. I was worried that becoming more fancy would mean worse food. I was relieved that the food was still good, though it is a bit pricier than I recall. Some coworkers and I came here for dinner on a Friday evening, so this review is for the dishes and not the dim sum. We ordered 5 dishes or so and they were all fairly good. Kudos for the peking duck, which was very flavorful. Especially the nice crispy skin.. yum yum. Other dishes didn't stand out so much but were still solid (e.g. mongolian beef). Their grilled pork chop had great flavor, but was just ever so slightly oily. Service was fairly good -- I don't expect the wait staff to linger around my table at Chinese restaurants, but the wait staff here was there when we needed them, especially for water refills. Much appreciated (I despise running out of water). Generally, Fu Lam Mum has pretty good dishes; nothing spectacular but you could do worse if you're searching along Castro for some Chinese food.

Yay, I found the Dim Sum experience I have been looking for. Fresh from the kitchen, steaming carts, tea, relatively inexpensive, baked goods, fried goods, steamed goods. ?Da works. Perhaps best summed up in the words of Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally, "Yes, Yes, YEEEEESSS!". ?Or, something close to that. And, they open at 10am. ?Cool. ?I advise getting there early cuz it does fill up. I compliment this place on the food variety in the carts. ?A lot of places (if you can even find them in this area), tend to have more limited cart entrees with the same stuff, and you have to order from the kitchen if you want it....not here. ?You get a whole lot of goodness directly from the cart. Really, really outstanding stuff. Kids can also get a kick from the live seafood downstairs. ?Proof of freshness, and practically a zoo exhibit too. Why not 5 stars? ?Cause that's rare air, and as good as FLM is, it still ain't no French Laundry. I have found my Dim Sum Mecca, though, and not too far from home.

Did the late night dinner dim sum finally and it was just okay. It's cool to know still that if I ever get a craving at night there's a place that's close by that I can go feast at. For the dinner I ate Taro Puffs, Sticky Rice, Crispy Shrimp Balls, Pan Fried Tofu, Shrimp Dumplings, Pork & Shrimp Dumplings, Everything came out to $55 with tax and tip. Not bad as they offer it as 3 items for $10. The food tasted okay but was nothing extravagant or special. Service however sucked and we had to constantly remind them to bring us condiments, tea and our food! The waiter even acknowledged 2 times that our shrimp balls were coming out, however, they never got to see the light of day (or night for that matter). We didn't have any expectations coming here and it being a typical sucky restaurant customer service so we just ate what did come out. We didn't bother to tell them to excuse it off the menu as well. The place gets full at night so come here early and just wait til dim sum is being served. Still IMO HK Saigon in SV is a better choice than this place any day of the week!

Go after 9pm for their late night specials. When there are only two of us, we like to order wonton noodle soup ($6) and a clay pot ($8; but beware, I've found a HAIR-- the curly kind... so GROSS-- in a seafood/eggplant clay pot before!). Oftentimes I find myself gazing longingly at other items on the late night menu... that we don't order because it would simply be too much food. I've also been for dim sum-- its good for the area, but nothing special. A solid 3 stars.

Either I have a bad memory or this place has gotten so much better! I came here four years ago and just recently went back but I don't remember the place looking so clean or the food tasting so good. Fu-Kin fried rice, I dream about you. Mushrooms, shrimp, and scallop tossed in Chinese gravy served over pan fried rice with egg-yummm! Cooking Papa's Fu-Kin ain't got nothing on this! If only it weren't a 30 minute drive and Fu-Kin didn't cost $12.99, I'd be a loyal regular!

Everything I've had here over the several times I've visited was quite good, especially the fish dishes, but nothing in particular stood out. ?This isn't a kung pao chicken kind of place; it's a good place to get authentic Chinese food (Cantonese-style). ?Late night dim sum is good for a break before going back to drinking! Service is really slow, even though the waitstaff look incredibly hurried. ?Wish I'd spoken Chinese earlier, maybe the service would've been faster.

This place is pretty good. I've been here numerous times for banquets, dim sum, late night food, and dinner in general. The banquet that I went to was when our family occupied the whole top floor and it was very nice. The area wasn't that big but it was good for a medium size group of people. Maybe like 5 tables. The downstairs is very big and the staff is very friendly. The food is very good and I really like how they have late night dim sum after 9PM. It's also priced reasonably (I think it's 3 for 10 dollars). All of the food here is very good and we drive 30 minutes just to come to this place.

my husband and i hosted a joint family dinner here during our wedding weekend. ?we chose this place for its location (downtown mountain view), size (large 2-story dining area), availability (table for 10 available on friday night), and menu selection. prices were very fair, we ordered a large variety of dishes, meat, fish, vegetables, soup, and averaged about $24/person. ?pretty good considering most of us were stuffed at the end of the dinner. some of the food was a bit greasy, which was not to my liking. ?while the variety of choices of food were good, we didn't feel there were any dishes that were particularly special or outstanding. ?it was just your average, decent chinese food. ?service was good, again, nothing special, but satisfactory to our party. undecided if we would return here, especially since there are many other chinese restaurants in the area to choose from.

The end of Castro is filled with the inviting smells of many ethnic gastronomic treats on a Saturday eve. I wanted traditional spicy Chinese. Looking across the street I found Fu Lam Mum. I had their Dinner fare, not the Dim Sum, but it appears the processes to make the Dim Sum affect the regular Chinese dishes. Dumplings/Pot Stickers were chewy, cold and unappealing; Cashew Prawns were slathered in oil and included loads of forget-me limp celery, carrots and mushrooms. The Mongolian Beef was the most normal meal, but it too was cold and not spicy enough (even though I asked). Finally, their freebie desert, a grimace-inspiring rectangle of Mango flavored gel. All I needed to see was some other tables' patrons trying it had me saying "no thanks- please take it away". But the service was better than normal.

Love the dim sum it here - plus they have late night discounted dim sum where you can eat on a decent table. Not your typical dimsum fastfood place. I am not a duck eater but their roast duck dimsum is the only duck I've eaten- it's pretty good! The ambiance is better than most dimsum places I've been. The high ceilings (unless you're in the 2nd floor) kind of shuts away the typical Chinese restaurant noises. I never really tried much of their regular dishes since I wasn't too fond when I tried some before. They have average service. I would always like my water and tea replenished but they seem to never do until told so.

I would give it a 3.5 star if I could. It was surprisingly good. The dimsum was fresh and tasty. The fried dumplings were not oily like you find at some dimsum joints. The restaurant was nice, clean and modern. The waitresses carry walky talkies to communicate. I thought that was pretty neat and improved the service. Will come back!

Went here to celebrate Father's Day dinner and it was hella packed! We made a reservation, but still had to wait like 15 min for our table. We wanted to order the 4-6 person set dinner menu, but they didn't have it. Instead, they only had this banquet style dinner menu that's 2x the price of the regular one, tried to rob us for a good meal! I was disappointed they ran out of duck, service was slooooow, each dish took 20 min to come out, and food was only alright. There are definitely better chinese options and it seemed like they were expecting such a busy crowd for Father's Day. I may come back to try out their dim sum one of these days.

This is a pretty standard dim sum place - things were tasty, but nothing wowed, and the service was typical Chinese - hasty glances, muttered words in half English/Chinese, and the loud 'what??' when they can't hear you speak. My boyfriend and I came here on a whim yesterday, and when we saw the huge crowd of Asian people standing outside, we thought, uh-oh, we're going to have to wait forever. But actually, we only waited 10 minutes, though it was during peak lunch time. Once we were seated, the ladies with the carts and trays were in full motion and our table filled up fast with little dishes. We ordered the shrimp and chive dumplings (yummy!), the mini char siu buns with the sweet, golden dough (yummy! soft, sweet on the outside, salty on the inside), the deep fried pork dumplings (a childhood fave, they had thick chewy outsides and tiny bit of pork inside), deep fried sesame balls with red bean middle (too little red bean, a little too greasy), potstickers (my boyfriend said these were just so so), steamed pork dumplings (hot and hearty!), and turnip cake (eh, typical). I think if I could rate the food, it would be a 3.5, but with the service being typical Chinese style, it bumps it to a 3. This place is decent, no doubt, and I do plan on trying the dinner.

OVERALL: 3.9 FOOD: 4 SERVICE: 4.5 AMBIANCE: 4 VALUE: 3 I've been here so many times I'm on a first-name basis with the owner. ?It all started way back when FLM was still at its original Castro location next to Therapy. ?With v2.0, the owner has upgraded to a bright, newly-remodeled 2-story space with ample seating, bar, "aquarium" (window shopping...?), and expanded dim sum service. While prices have unquestionably gone up with all the upgrades, I don't mind paying the premium since service and quality are always solid. ?Even if anything is overlooked or lagging, staff is quick to apologize and compensate, with complimentary soup and/or dessert. Dim Sum: best to go Saturday/Sunday 10am-1pm during peak hours when carts come full, fresh, and often. ?The wait time is easily spent mosying along Castro street or at Neto next door. ?My favorites: Taro Puffs (?) and Shrimp & Chive Dumplings (pan fried). Late Night: abbreviated dim sum menu & specials (similar to lunch time prices). ?The semi-responsible nutritionist in me goes for the Broccoli Chicken (great garlic & ginger flavor) & Seafood Tofu Soup (piping hot and satisfyingly full of shrimp, scallops & silky tofu). ?The indulgent streak goes for Beef Chow Fun & Spicy Mixed Seafood Hotpot (GREAT for cold nights...fish, shrimp, squid, braised tofu added on request, in chili sauce). My favorite place for Chinese in Mountain View!

Food is good- Went to eat there last Thursday night for Dinner. This is my 2nd review of this place. ?The reason why I'm giving them an extra star up to 3 is because the food is good. ? The waitress we had was rude and always refused to satisfy our small demands. ?First, I asked for large plates and lady said no. No explanation given. ?Then she directed the hispanic bus-boy to get us some large plates. ?This Bizzatch wanted us to eat on the small sized saucer plates that came with our soup bowls. Every small request I asked for put this particular waitress out of her way. ?When she was taking our order, I asked for the Chicken Feet in vinegar appetizer and, you guessed it, "NO", and said they didn't have it available. ?In the back of my mind, I was like "WTF" is your problem, DF? ? You will know who this individual is when you first see her, if you're lucky to have her wait your table. ?Short older lady with short hair, ugly mug. ?I complained to the manager- Simon, he apologized and offered to give my kids some candy. ?Friendly gentleman, terrible waitresses. ?Just keep this in mind- Don't be afraid to ask what you want because you're paying for the food.

This is a review for morning Dimsum service. I should start with saying, this is possibly the worst place to eat Chinese Dimsum in the south bay. We paid to be sitting in a nice dining room with high ceilings, but the good ends there. From the outside, the restaurant looks upscale and clean - but the facade fooled us! Service was non-existent, waiters idling about like zombies, food was sub-standard and trying to pay & get out was sheer-agony!!! They totally killed the Shanghai soup dumplings (Xiu Long bao). The dumpling skin was rubber-ry and the inside was all dried out. It wasn't warm or even lukewarm. Just cold and dry. ? The Har gaw and Xiu Mai was forgettable and should be forgotten. The Durian Puff was all puff pastry & no durian. At the end of this miserable dimsum, all we could think about was to get the check and get out of this place. And even that took 20 minutes! We had to remind them to give us the check and urge them to return our card. Now, whenever we walk past this restaurant down Castro St for a stroll, we can't help but make fun of the dimsum and remind ourselves, we'll never be sitting in that window again.

Went in a few Sunday's back for the dim sum. It's Sunday, so of course it's packed. There was only 2 of us, so we were immediately seated on the upper level. The only issues is that I always feel like the carts with the "good stuff" miss you when you're way up there. Oh well..we had: 1. dumplings with shrimp and chives - nice juicy dumpling w/o too much grease. 2. eggplant stuffed with shrimp in sauce - hands down the best dish. Give me this and a bowl of rice and I'll be a very happy girl. 3. Duck - my dim sum standby. I would have preferred a crisper skin, but I rarely complain about duck. 4. rolled noodles with spicy sauce and dried shrimp - husband didn't like, but I thought it was tasty. The place was packed, so even though we asked for fried rice, it never arrived. At least they didn't charge us for it...

This is one of the few late night restaurants in Mountain View on a Thursday night. They have a great discount menu since it's night time. The food was quality, the service was a bit slow, the place was nice and clean.. I would totally come here anytime for great Chinese food! I also recently had dim sum lunch here. Totally awesome, but don't get seated on the second level. We spent soooo much time up there looking down at the dim sum carts on the first level and STARVING. The service is awesome though, super friendly and kind.

3.5 star. Came for late night dim sum on a week day. ?The restaurant was half full on the first floor and the service was better than a crowded weekend. ? We aimed to try out the 3 for $10 dim sum menu and to my surprise some items were quite interesting. ?Among all 6 dishes we tried, I would recommend the chicken and pumpkin porridge. ?Shiu mai is pretty descent, shrimp and leek dumpling is ok, shrimp dumpling is also ok, the minced beef and taro porridge is creative with lots of ingredients but not my cup of tea with the cilantro. With regards to the steamed spare ribs with rice noodle, the spare ribs are OK but the rice noodle is not too well soaked with the meat juice. ?I noticed that they used "ho fun" instead of the real paper thin "chen chuen fun", hence the taste difference. ? Note that you have to order 3 items to get the $10 deal, otherwise, a single item is $4+. ?Overall, I like their porridge selections but the portions are not that big (only one medium bowl size).

Have come here for daytime dim sum a handful of times now and it's all pretty consistent. Once in awhile the baskets we get are cold since it's been around on the carts but overall, I still like this place and recommend coming here if you're craving decent dim sum and don't want to drive to SF. Go early if you want to get egg tarts, they seem to run out by noon-ish. I highly recommend late night dim sum. It's 3 dishes for $10 (order in multiples of 3) and it's all cooked after you order so everything is piping hot and fresh. I would say this is my favorite option at Fu Lam Mum.

This is mostly in regards to the dim-sum (which I didn't know is served at lunch time, usually I eat here for late meals in the evening). ? ?then again, my friend and I also ordered two regular plates, the dim-sum I picked up as appetizers since I was curious to try it out. The dim sum idn't taste very good. ? ? On the plainer side of flavor. ? ?I tried the chive "hockey puck" dumplings, char siu so, and the sticky rice chicken. ? Something was missing. ?

This place was much better before they moved locations. ?They used to be further down Castro St. in a smaller spot and were relatively ghetto. ?Now, the place is all fancy and the prices are higher, but the food tastes exactly the same. ?(It doesn't help that the food wasn't that good to beigin with).

I really gave this place flack in my previous review, but I know the reason why. ?You have to know what to order here in order for it to be good. ?The good stuff isn't the cheapest on the menu either, so you must take that into account. ?I would not do dim sum here, no matter what anyone says. ?I learned that in my previous visit. ? What you must get here is the preserved egg and pea sprouts (jin ying dan da dou miao [gold silver egg large pea sprouts]). ?It's amazing. ?The other dishes that come to mind include things like the salty fish, chicken, and tofu clay pot. ?There are a few others, but you must be adventurous and stray away from the dim sum menu and the americanized dishes. I would come back here as I've said before, it isn't my first choice, but it is good if you know what to order.

If it's after 9pm and you're wondering around Castro looking for a place to eat, check out Fu Lam Mum. They serve late night dim sum daily after 9pm, and it's 3 items for $10. Pretty good deal no? Fu Lam Mum is a decently-sized restaurant. The main room is packed with big tables and small tables, so no matter the size of your party, they'll have a table for you! The service was pretty good, considering the time of night. I figured the servers would be slow and grouchy, but all the servers I encountered were friendly and nice. I've been here twice for late night dim sum and was satisfied each time. There's a list of 24 items that you can choose from. Since there aren't any carts at night, you have to specifically order what you want. So far I've tried the Shrimp & Pork Dumplings, Steamed Chicken Feet, Sticky Rice Wrapped in Lotus Leaf, Steamed Pork Buns, Fried Taro Puff, and Pork & Preserved Egg Porridge. Overall, if you're just looking for some good food late at night, then check out Fu Lam Mum. However, be warned that late night dim sum is most definitely not the same as weekend lunch time dim sum. The dim sum is good, but there is some difference in quality. Pictures: http://bit.ly/hUHOgP, http://bit.ly/f4zYS8, http://bit.ly/gS2iU4, http://bit.ly/hIKU1U, http://bit.ly/gyYtdr

My sister and I were there on 04-27-08. ?The restaurant seemed frazzled. ?The staff didn't quite know what they were doing and dim sum being pushed out was sporadic. Went back again a week later. ?Service had improved. ?Food availability was still a bit sporadic. ?The shrimp dumpling (har gow) had good skin, but the filling was a bit dry. ?Steamed beef noodle (beef cheung fun) needs a bit of dry aged tangerine peel. ?The Malaysian steamed cake (ma lai go) was AWESOME. ?Soft, warm and just sweet enough. ?Stuffed eggplant had really good sauce. ? For the most part, the techniques executed were excellent, but there was very little innovation. ?No signature dim sum items. ?Nothing new that I haven't had in dozens of other dim sum restaurants.

UPDATE 7/1 I was surprised that Fu Lam Mum's avg rating isn't higher, given the crowds that gather there every evening / weekend. ?I think, however, after reading the individual reviews that many of the really low reviews are from...people who don't have expertise in Cantonese cuisine (folks, all Chinese food is NOT the same). I can confidently say that among those who know Cantonese cuisine (i.e. the 150 guests at my wedding, the majority of whom are Cantonese and are from or have visited Hong Kong) Fu Lam Mum got very high ratings. I had my wedding banquet at Fu Lam Mum in early June and was amazed by the quality of their banquet food! ?Everyone who's been to a Cantonese wedding banquet knows that food usually goes down a notch or two because the chef is cooking for several hundred people at once...but no, in this case, the food was better than ever! The managers of the restaurant, Ben and Simon, were very professional. ?The staff were exceeding professional and the food came out in a timely, well-paced manner. ?Would definitely recommend them for a wedding banquet (in addition to a regular dinner) ---------------------- Visited for the first time about a week and a half ago for dinner and wasn't disappointed! ?I had the rather unique experience of picking this place for my wedding banquet without trying the food first (the restaurant wasn't even done yet!) ?Brave indeed...but now I'm psyched by my choice! My family is full of tough food critics...especially when it comes to Cantonese food (since my parents and uncles are from Hong Kong originally). ?This place got rave reviews...from my future in-laws, my mother, my uncles, my father, my father's friend...word is definitely getting around in the Chinese community! The dinner I had there was fabulous! ?The peking duck in particular (I know, I know, not really a Cantonese dish...) was fantastic - just the right amount of fat, but not overwhelmingly greasy like some other places. ?Good duck flavor as well and they included a lot of meat. ?The vegetables were also extremely fresh and well-prepared (we had the 'dow mew'...a type of bean sprout). For folks complaining about the cost...well good Chinese food (like any other cuisine) costs money! ?Also most Chinese families don't order alcohol with their meals...so the restaurants can't count on that as a cash cow. ?If you want a good deal - come after 9pm on weekdays and order their late night specials ( less than $9 per person). Oh and they serve a mean dim sum on weekend (maybe weekday) mornings as well! ?Word from my relatives is that it's better than Joy Luck Place and the other South Bay options.

Recently reopened in their new digs next to HK Bistro, Fu Lam Mum seems to be aiming towards a more upscale clientele. Dim sum for 2 on a Sunday... The place was hopping and we waited about 20-30 minutes to get a table. Given reviews from fellow Yelpers, we were lucky to get a table on the ground floor and fairly close to kitchen. However, we ended up being on the wrong side of the circuit, as the carts that passed by us tended to have already been around the floor once, so variety was sometimes a little lacking and food was sometimes a little lukewarm. We opened with the chrysanthemum tea - the tea was decent but I had hoped to actually have chrysanthemum petals/buds in the tea, given the upscale image FLM presents. And then picked up... Shrimp chow fun (xia chang fen) - pretty good, though some shrimp were very juicy and tender while others in the same order were a little dry Siu mai (shao mai) - tender and done pretty well Fried taro dumpling (yu tou jiao) - good taro flavor, but a little lukewarm in the middle Har gow (xia jiao) - done well, moist and tender, not dry like you sometimes find at other places Pan-fried chive shrimp dumplings (jiu cai bao) - good amount of filling, nicely crisp outside, and just downright tasty - probably my favorite of the meal My dining companion wasn't feeling the turnip cake (luo bo gao) or chicken feet (feng zhua) today, so those will have to wait for a return visit. Also, they ran out fried shrimp balls (zha xiao qiu) right before the cart got to our table and the kitchen never came out with more... Sadness. Their menu professes to have an even wider selection of goods - so next time I may have to try ordering directly from the wait staff. I certainly understand the appeal of the entire dim sum cart experience, but I find that ordering off a menu is more efficient and usually gets you hot food straight from the kitchen. YMMV. Bill came out to just over $20 for 2 people - not stuffed, but comfortably full. Overall, comparable to Joy Luck Place down in CV - quality is perhaps a little behind JLP but it's also a little cheaper - and not as far as a drive as Millbrae, where some of the best dim sum is. Waitstaff were mix between Cantonese and Mandarin speakers. So the final verdict, not too shabby. 3.5 stars for now, with potential to move up to 4, pending return visits. Will likely be back to check out some more dim sum, plus the late nght menu ($8 a dish from 9p-1a).

The both ducks, peking boneless duck, and cantonese crispy skin duck, are pretty amazing. The peking duck is de-boned, de-fat, and pure goodness of super crispy skin and juicy meat. The duck comes with the steamed buns, sweet sauce and scallions. You are to wrap the duck meat AND skin in the bun, with the sauce and scallions. The duck tastes great without the bun too. The cantonese crispy skin duck has GREAT flavor, thanks to the great marinate. The skin is crispy, which is to my surprise cuz I though it'll ge soggy because of the dressing. I do think this is overall too greasy, or much greasier than the peking boneless duck. It's not de-boned, so all the fat remains, plus the grease from the dressing, too greasy for my taste.Nonetheless, it tastes great that 2 of us finished one duck in no time. The glazed shrimp with walnut is pretty amazing. The flavor of shrimp bursts in ur mouth once u bite into it. The service is nice. The waitress remembers me somehow and was very very friendly. Clean, new restaurant. Not a cheap eat. Great place to take friends, family, or colleagues for a chinese treat.

I went there last Friday for dim sum. I've not been to many dim sum places but I believe their dim sum is only average. I had better meals at Joy Luck Place (Cupertino) than I had at Fu Lam Mum. The place is new and somewhat "fancy" but the food was not special at all.

Great value dim sum. We found it is just your typical offerings that you expect. The pork buns were rare as hen's teeth, as usual. On a Saturday at noon it wasn't too crowded. They would get 3.5 stars if I could because they had the great baked custard buns for dessert. You don't often get those. We didn't walk away amazed, but we certainly weren't unsatisfied either. Also, I hear they do late night dim sum - perfectly located near the Caltrain Station - good to know!!!!

So me and my honey went here last night. I'm still on the hunt for a good Chinese food restaurant in my area. I didn't realize I was walking into a dim sum restaurant. lol. Totally caught me off guard. The place seemed a bit classier than expected as well but I did see folks dressed down. The menu was large and very impressive. It was a bit overwhelming trying to figure out what to eat. Service was very slow too but when you had their attention they were very helpful. When the food got to our table it was pretty good. Expensive but good. $60 for 2 people. Wonton Soup, Lemon Chicken, Pawns and Walnuts and Combination Rice. Ouch! I must say I wish I knew what to order here everyone else had some nice looking food. Bring a friend who knows how to order! I'd be willing to go again if offered. The food was good just a bit pricey.

The dim sum is very, very adequate! Not too pricey. Same ol' pushiness, but with much newer dinnerware and much nicer decor than Golden Wok (remember that place!?). Fun times. I don't know about having a banquet here, especially for a wedding, though. Because we were eating dim sum above someone's wedding banquet and that seemed a little odd. Oh well, to each its own. (:

This restaurant used to be one of my favorite for late night meal way back when. I only found out that it was relocated to this new spot, closer to downtown public parking structure, a couple of months ago. Last night, I went to this place for dinner for the first time in 6 or 7 years. I was glad to see that they still had after-9pm specials although the selections were much less than before. One that is no longer on the after-9pm special menu and that I used to order all the time was salt & pepper soft shell crab. Clams with black bean sauce was also a goner from the special menu. All after-9pm specials are $8. Along with these after-hour specials, they also serve dim-sum -- $10 for 3 items. I never had any good dim-sum that was served outside of lunch hours, so I think that I would just stay away from these late night dim-sum items at this restaurant as well. ? My wife and I wanted to order with lots of vegetables for this time, and I just couldn't find anything from their after-9pm menu, so decided to order these below from their regular menu. - Sauteed seafood and vegetables with XO sauce - Deluxe sauteed vegetables They were both pretty good. At some places, seafood (shrimp and calamari) isn't prepped well and even over-done. Their seafood items came out just right. Their sauteed vegetables were done right as well. Another good part of this restaurant is that they open until 12pm (although they used to open until 2am when they were at the old location when I was their regular customer).

I like this place. It's clean, it's trendy, the service is quick, and the food is great. I do find it a little expensive. I used to go to the dim sum place in east SJ and noticed I spend about ten dollars more at Fu Lam Mum. The folks here are can speak english! Yes, this is important for people like me! I'm used to guessing or asking questions and getting blank stares. Here, the servers let me know whats in each dish and I can almost have a conversation with them. It does get pretty hectic in here, but the place is cozy enough to get decent quick service. On top of the that, you're not trapped in a sea of chairs or bumping elbows with the carts that roll by. Overall, I like this place a lot. There's plenty of parking, and the area it's in is great for walking off a huge meal.

This restaurant can be intense. ?We came here for lunch on a Saturday because I wanted Matt to have his first dim sum experience. ?We were seated upstairs with a view of the main floor, which provided good entertainment while we were eating. ? It took about 5-10 minutes before the first cart came by but once it did, it was like a flood of carts swarmed our table. ?I told Matt to just point at what looked good so that's what he did. ?They didn't have a huge selection but the items that we did get were good. ?Yum, pork buns.

I like the dim sum here, and the restaurant is cleaner than a lot of other chinese restaurants. There are seatings on two levels. The lines can be quite long on weekends, so be prepared for a crowded restaurant. ? I have not tried dinner here, only dim sum, and I think they have a lot of selections to choose from. Taste are better than most dim sum places in San Jose, SClara, & Sunnyvale. ? Their service are good as well. Even on busy crowded days, I never had problems with getting refills on the hot tea or ordering food from the carts that come around. ?Check out the light fixtures, I thought they are pretty cool.

Came here for dimsum during the weekend, not bad! ?Service was friendly and quick, we were impressed the waitress actually remembered what we asked for and brought it to us directly when it came out. We had the normal fare - shrimp dumpling, sui mai, glutinous rice dumpling, etc. ?All tastes pretty good. ?I thought the rice noodle skin part on the shrimp dumpling and rice noodle rolls were a bit thick, but tasty nonetheless. Will definitely come back when we have dim sum cravings! ?A lot easier to get the dishes we want from the friendly staff, and parking in downtown MV is much easier than a Ranch99 parking lot.

I love Fu Lam Mum! I was way long overdue for some dim sum, so I rounded up some former colleagues for lunch today... I'm so happy I chose to come back here. Fu Lam Mum never disappoints. It's reasonably priced, the carts keep wheeling by, servers are always friendly, the restaurant itself is more than decent looking, and, the food is excellent! FINAL ANSWER: I highly recommend this spot especially for team lunches.

After having gone to a few dim sum places over the course of my life, I'd have to say that this is my favorite one in the South Bay. Everything is always hot and fresh, and not overly greasy. They serve some traditional Cantonese dishes during dim sum, such as beef tripe + spleen; pigs feet ?+ soy sauce eggs, etc., and I'd have to say that the tripe was pretty good, but the feet were just OK (a little but too vinegary for my taste). Expect 20-min waits, though, even if you get there at 11:00-11:30 am., and even longer waits up to 45-min on holidays.

I brought a few people here for an informal new year's dinner. ?We made a reservation and we are really glad we did. ?The service wasn't anything fancy. ? They were super busy and getting someone to help you immediately was a bit challenging. The food was pretty good. ?Strong flavors and not too greasy (especially the duck which can be more fatty and greasy than meaty). ?I will probably make a return visit if I don't want to travel too far.

I came here for dim sum with my coworker friends for lunch. ?It's a really nice restaurant with two floors, high ceilings, open space and lots of windows. ?A couple of my coworker friends were Chinese, so they knew what to order. ?I tried a few new dim sum dishes aside from my regular dim sum order, which was the taro dumplings, steamed rice noodle rolls with shrimp inside, and taro puffs. ?We also ordered the shrimp and pork dumplings, Chinese broccoli, chow mein noodles and egg custard tarts. ?The dim sum was delicious, the service was good, but we had to wait a while for the chow mein noodles because they were so busy. Be sure to get there early for lunch or dinner because the seating fills up quickly.

Fu Lam Mum gets about half of my dim sum business (the other half goes to Dim Sum King). I come here frequently on Sundays after shopping at the Mountain View Farmer's Market. The place is always pretty packed. I'm an ABC, so I don't get anything too exotic (ie. intestines or chicken feet), just the standard fare -- shrimp dumpling, BBQ pork buns, sui mai, turnip cake-- and they do that pretty well. Their baked chicken buns is the best I've ever had -- my kids seem to really eat it up. The noise level at the place is very high, but with two loud kids of my own, they seem to just blend into the background without disturbing anyone.

The duck was cold, oily and mainly bones. Some of the dim sum could have been very good but it almost all came out luke warm. Overall, our excitement to enjoy good dim sum was not appeased. Service was very spotty and servers rushed by or piled up and waited too long. Maybe that's the nature of dim sum dining, but I've had hotter and better.

Just had dinner here. The place looked nice. decoration is nice but simple at the same time. We had to wait a good 25 minutes for our table of 8. By then I was starving. Our first dish.. Beef West Lake Soup.. was bland. Had to salt & pepper it myself. That dish isn't too hard to make. The food picked up a bit afterwards but it still wasn't great. What I didn't like was the service. The entire staff seems to lack experience. The busboy/ tea guy only knew of Jasmine tea. Our server was Chinese, yet he couldn't tell apart the vegetables. We had ordered a dish that was in a lil wok & sat on top if a lit flame. Half the time, we had to relight the pot ourselves cause it was out of propane or something. Dessert.. was even better. I ordered a sweet roll of some sort for dessert. We seriously waited 20 mins for it.. before we flagged down a server to ask about it. They told us.. they didnt have anymore... that they had ran out. Note.. we had already paid the bill & the entire party was waiting on me for my dessert. I'm not bashing. The owners are really sweet. & I understand the restaurants still kind of new. I believe the place had some potential. but they have a lot of work to do.

I am giving it 2 stars for the decor and for the owners hard work and perserverance towards the american dream. other than that, the old adage holds true....well decorated chinese restaurants aren't very good at making food. We had dim sum here on a sunday, and chinese tradition dictates that if you can't make something as basic as dim sum, you are in trouble. We tried the traditional dim sum dishes in order to have a base bench mark with which to gauge the food. ?This included: Lotus wrapped sticky rice - this was bland, sticky rice too gelatinous Har Gow - skin too thick, shrimp tasted frozen Siu Mai - bland Har Cheng Fun - noodle too chewy and thick, shrimp didn't taste fresh Char Sao Bao - salty and bun was mushy These are not good signs. ?If the simple dishes cannot be accomplished, I would hate to see how the expensive and exclusive dishes such as Shark's Fin Soup and Treasure from the Sea Soup come out. Hopefully, Ben will recognize what is wrong with the kitchen and fix it before his restaurant venture craps out.

this was one of the better lunches I've had in my life. I think the ambience and just the way the food is served makes a huge difference! we got a bunch of the dimsums off the carts - even though sometimes we didn't understand what the server said, we're adventurous enough to point and eat so it was almost fun not knowing what we were getting. mainly because it was all pretty much good. I have to say there were some scary looking things which the more adventurous in my party ate and I would still stay away from, but it was all good. quick, efficient service with reasonable prices. the shu mai, pork buns, duck, chicken, spare ribs... everything was good! this is a great experience - I'd recommend everyone try it out at least once!

I came once with 2 co-workers on a Friday. ?The wait for a table was pretty long because when we got there, they did not open upstairs for the customers yet but a few minutes after we finally got a table, they decided to open up the 2nd level too (man--that sux). Mediocre dim sum (it was a hit-or-miss). But after I got back to work, I felt very greased out and had to spend some time in the ladies room :(

This place has been on Castro St. for a long time. The new location is great, especially when parents come into town as it is much nicer looking. I've been there for a dinner a few times. Weeknights are pretty easy but be advised there could be a wait on weekends. I thought the food was pretty good. My family was happy with the quality and prices. They ordered the banquet menu which included duck, prawns with walnuts, and steamed tofu. The service still needs a bit of work. I found that the managers are well-trained and have a good eye, but not all the servers know the system yet. Also, the hostes my friend and I had a couple weeks ago was so overwhelmed that she skipped us even after the manager told her we were next. The food on a Saturday night took a long time. I have yet to try the dim sum but am very excited to have more choices around Mountain View without having to go all the way down to Cupertino or Ming's. If I could give a 3.5 I would, but since I can't, I'm giving 4 stars for now with the hope that the service will even out a bit over time.

Came here Sunday night at about 9.30 pm with two friends, Lawrence K. and Fran H. ?First off, this is a clean looking Chinese restaurant with high ceilings, and a 2nd floor dining area overlooking the first floor. ?We were immediately seated and started looking over the menu. ?I let Lawrence K. do all the ordering b/c this is a place he suggested. ? BBQ Pork and Roast Pork appetizer - this appetizer was served with a hot mustard/mayo dipping sauce on the side. ?First time I've ever had the sauce, and both types of pork were delicious. Blanched Shrimp with spicy soy sauce dipping sauce - not on their menu, but Lawrence K. has ordered this dish before. ?Asked for 1 lb. of shrimp and there were about 10 shrimp. ?Not over-cooked and the soy sauce was really good with chili peppers and green onion. Lettuce Cups with Seafood - again, this dish was very tasty. ?Lots of shrimp and scallops. ?Fran H.'s choice on this one! Oyster and Roast Pork Clay Pot - a little bit small, but cooked to perfection! ?The roasted pork wasn't overcooked and dry. ?The oysters (about 5-6) were large and the sauce was not too salty (b/c many Chinese places make this clay pot, but usually salty). Ginger and Green Onion Crab - really, really good. ?The meat was tender and tasted fresh. ?The only thing I didn't like was they 'cleaned' out the stuff under the shell...which is the best part! Service was very good...with the exception that they brought rice out to our table, before anything was served. ?They also almost gave us the wrong dish that another table had ordered. ?The waitress we had was on top of it! ?We had a quizzical look on our faces, and she immediately came over, looked at what was on our table, took back the rice, and brought the correct dish to the correct table. ?She even said to the lady that brought the rice and dish to us, "What are you doing??? ?They appetizers just came out, and the clay pot you gave them was wrong!" All in all, a great dining experience! ?They are opened late, even on Sunday, and serve dim sum after 9 pm (for a special price of $10 for three different plates of dim sum, of course there is more than three kinds to choose from!). ? Seriously, this is one of the best tasting and very authentic Chinese restaurants I have been to. ?You have a hankering for good Chinese food...you gotta give this place a try!

This place was delightful. That's the opinion a friend and I had. The 15$ Peking duck tasted better because it was on sale. The giant clam dish was delicious (and unique/new to me) - also 15$ - although if you're a spice wimp stay away from the peppers. Their hotness tends to linger. I so appreciated the taro pudding-ish jello complimentary dessert - such a delectable combination of flavors. I will be returning, not only for the frog legs, and the sea cucumber, but for many dreamy items on the long variety filled menu. Thoughts of scrumptious-ness. ---- Update: Just went there and highly recommend the taro oyster egg pancake. The jellyfish and seaweed salad and squab were all solid :)

Serious dim sum eaters, please don't come here. ?The food is just not good. ?Is it inedible? ?No it's edible, but it's mediocre at best. ? One major thing to judge dim sum restaurant by is Har Gow. ?Since about 75% of all dished have the same shrimp in it, well if the shrimp ain't crunchy and sweet then probably these other 75% of your dishes aren't very good. ?Secondly, if the skin on the har gow is either too soft or too dry, then your cheurng fun probably ain't gonna be good either. Spareribs - fatty and dry... ? This place doesn't even give you the garlic chili paste that is your dim sum standard. Due to FLM's convenience, they got an additional star. ?As for dim sum quality food, I would have to say saigon taste much much better ( but beware of the fish on the wall's as they may attack you!)

Came here for the first time today. ?It was overall a good experience for me. ?The shau lon pau, which is a litmus test for me, failed, but the other dishes were from decent to good on the tasty scale. ?The shau lon pau's bottom was too thick, so overall the dumpling was too doughy for me and not enough broth inside. The sticky rice was good, but how can you get this wrong? ?The shrimp roll dumplings and other standard dumplings were decent but nothing really tasty. ?The pork slices were good. ? The shrimp stuffed mushrooms were tasty and probably the best thing I had today, which might not be good indicator for a dim sum place. ?The cold tofu was clean and pretty good, and their egg plant in garlic sauce was solid.

Not a bad spot for dim sum on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Since we were closer to the San Jose area, decided not to make the trek to Chinatown in SF. Parking is plentiful, with free public lots nearby. You'll notice during the walk from the parking lot to the restaurant that there are tons of eateries, especially of the Asian sort, all over the place. Good to have options, just in case. Thankfully, the wait wasn't long for the two of us. Got seated right away and started the binging process that is dim sum. Everything was pretty good, especially the sticky rice wrapped in banana leaf (which chicken and Chinese sausage) and the shumai, which really is the definitive dish - at least in my book. If they can't make shumai correctly, you're probably not going to succeed with other items. One other positive to note: most dim sum places give you Coke by the can when you order. I mean... I can go through a can of Coke with a few gulps. They serve it fountain style here and don't charge you for refills. And service is fairly quick, despite the madness of a packed house. Will be back again the next time I'm in the Bay.

This is my favorite place for dim sum in the area. Food is tasty and quite authentic. Service is typical of Chinese restaurants. My favorite is the lightly deep fried tofu (tender and soft inside with a hint of sweet taste) and the eggplant stuffed with prawn. If you come before 11:30am or after 1pm on weekends, there is usually no lines. They also serve late night dim sum which I have yet to try out.

Definitely an average Dim Sum spot. I would only come back if I was really craving Dim Sum and I didn't have time to go anywhere else (since I work in Mountain View) The price is not overly priced or anything, but the food was just mediocre. I would keep expectations low and just accept it for what it is - a very very average restaurant.

It's not topshelf Dim Sum (you'll need to make the trek to SF for that), but it's a huge leg up from what they sell down El Camino at Ranch 99 and a helluva lot better than what you're gonna find in the frozen section. Fu Lam Mum offers a large dining room (opening up their second floor during weekends) and a diverse variety of plates (steamed, baked, cold, soup, and fried to order). However, be advised that quantity does not equate to quality. Their xiao long baos (soup dumplings) are moist, but lack actual broth. Their har gow and siu mai will do, and their chasu bao is acceptable, but not fabulous. Service can be pretty spotty, but then again what actual Chinese place isn't? Given that a significant portion of the surrounding area is of Asian decent or actively seeks out Asian food, you can at least be rest assured that the food is authentic and not a "sell out" to acquire to Caucasian taste. Wait can get pretty out of control on the weekends, but I like it for brunch. Leave your manners at home and come in with your game face on - you'll need it to flag down carts, demand for waters, and hold your ground when they try to upsell you. Coming back for more? Beats driving to SF and manning the Chinatown traffic if you're just looking to get your fix satiated.

Best Chinese food I've had in recent (and not so recent) memory. We got the Hong Kong Style BBQ Pork and the Seafood & Eggplant Clay Pot. There was nothing not to love about the food -- the clay pot especially was delicious! Generous portions, fair prices and servers that actually speak English. Oh and that smell some people mention? Yeah...it's kind of in there but you get used to it after about 5 minutes. It smells like fermented vegetables and dried fish -- kind of like Ranch 99 but not as fishy. Anyway, definitely a fan!

I like it! Superbowl/Lunar New Year weekend but wait wasn't too bad since called in for a reservation for dim sum for 10 people at 12:40pm so they do take reservations. Dim sum - most things were warm or hot with good flavor. The tofu was cold and not crispy on the outside. Taro puff buns and Baked Custard buns were delicious. Crepe Noodle with beef was delicious as well, the noodle was not too thick and wasn't thin either. The filling was the right amount. Yay! Finally a place that can make crepe noodles the way I like it. The interior is definitely unique from a lot of SF or Millbrae dim sum restaurants. Come and enjoy some tea with tasty dim sum that won't disappoint.

This is a very typical dim sum place: a large noisy dining hall with food carts circulating. The food is as good as most places, not spectacular, but pretty tasty, and there is a wide selection available. They will even bring out dishes not currently on the cart for you if you ask. I have found that where you get seated decides just how good your experience at this restaurant will be. Whenever my friends and I end up closest to the kitchen doors, where the full carts come out, we will have a great selection and quick service. If you are unlucky enough to be in the area that gets covered last before they wheel the cart back into the kitchen, you may have to wait a while to get your food, and the best dishes may all be gone by then. This is my standby for dim sum brunch. Never ate anything off their a-la carte menu, just dim sum, so can't say much about their regular food.

Have been there twice for lunch, and can't see why it draws so many people. Have had dim sum from the carts and ordered off the menu. On both occasions, much of the food was over-salted -- not just a little but a lot. Noisy, not good for a business lunch. ?Tip: ?Don't sit next the to aquariums, because you'll get lots of kids and their parents almost climbing over you to see the fish.

Love their dim sum-- it's good, basic, and very quick, which is a plus, since I'm toting around 2 kids under the age of 3. ?I love that I can eat in about 20 minutes and be out the door. ?Even when it's busy, there's never a long wait, thanks to the upstairs seating. ? We also love their dinners-- everything is pretty decent and the prices are reasonable. ?It's a relatively clean place, as well, which is important in my book! The only annoyance is that I always need to ask for something a couple of times before I get it (like water, or a straw, for instance).

They have a reduced price menu after 9PM A GREAT deal. and great place to eat late at night. The Hunan style bean curd with pork ?is awesome. Lots of garlic, chilies, and a wonderful sauce served on a sizzling grill. The Salt and Pepper Crab is simply amazing. 5 stars. The fun noodles with seafood is a winner also. ?Depending on who is cooking it can vary. ?I like the brazing of the noodles that gives it a special flavor that is wonderful. If you know what dishes are awesome then you will be extremely happy, but there were a lot of duds before I hit on the winning recipes. So good to get someones opinion on what is good there. I'm not a dim sum fan but a LOT of people were into it. Only disappointment is no healthy brown rice alternative. White rice not so good for diabetics, and Bathroom could be cleaned more often.

This is my favorite lunch place. ?It's your typical family owned Chinese restaurant focusing on cheap and fast eats. ?The differentiator is that they make things especially tasty. ?The consistency isn't always there, but when they do make it well, this place is 5 star all the way. ? I recommend any of their seafood dishes, except maybe their prawns which I wasn't too enthused with, I think maybe they were dead before cooking... You know what I'm talking about. Go there after 9PM and you can order off the super cheap lunch menu.

I like eggplant and garlic so I always order that if it's on the menu. Yep, Fu Lam Mum has it on the menu and was very good. I'd say better than most other places. The eggplant was cooked long enough but not so long as to be complete mush. Also got the house fried rice, which was ok. It was made with shrimp, chicken, and krab (yes the fake stuff). The waiter was attentive and pleasant. Overall, I liked this place and will try it again.

I don't normally eat eggplant, but Fu Lam Mum makes some downright tasty eggplant. ?Another dish I enjoy is the crispy fried fish. ? Service is great compared to some other Chinese restaurants in the area. Go during lunch or after 9pm to take advantage of the lunch time specials.

NOTE: ?This review is for the original Fu Lam Mum (before the update and move to new location). I get the same dishes every time I come here: ?the braised tofu, salted fish and chicken fried rice, and steamed fish. ?The quality and taste are always consistent. ?The size of the fish can vary, however, so it's probably best to inquire before ordering. ?Once, I opened my takeout to discover a very tiny fish. ?:( ?It tasted good, but was seriosuly small. As far as ambience, there isn't much going on here. ?It's your basic Chinese restaurant, where you go for food and not much else.

For all you Mountain Viewers looking for good Chinese food, this is the place. I've ordered take-out from here a couple of times, and the food is less greasy than Queen House. Get the fried rice! The rice is soft and fluffy and the food is fresh. It's getting great business that it's moving to a bigger location! Still on Castro, so don't freak out. I recently saw signs that it'll be between Hong Kong Bistro and Xahn (Vietnamese food). That would be so crazy if the restaurant took up the entire building and used the 2nd floor. I can't wait for it to re-open

The crispy hangar duck is fantastic! We've been here twice and we've had it both times. The skin is really crispy, the meat tender and juicy and the taste excellent. It's really among the best duck I've ever had. The sauce it's served with is strange and we always skip it cos just the duck on it's own is enough. The ee fu noodles are ok but we can't eat crab so that's a bit of a shame. I like it a bit softer but hubby liked it as it was, "al dente". I wish they had a vegetarian version with mixed mushrooms. The claypot eggplant Vietnamese style (with spicy basil) was yummy but I prefer the Chinese version without the spicy basil. In general, the food is good, the duck is great and we really have to try the dim sum one of these days.

We came here today around 10:45am and we were seated immediately with a packed downstairs. ?We sat by the kitchen area so got some piping out food while it came out. Only dimsum that was luke warm were the platters that came out. Shrimp Cheung Fun - Pretty decent Sticky rice with the lotus wrap - Pretty decent but small with very little pork and mushroom inside. Shredded Chicken with Panfried noodles - $9 and it was okay. ? Daikon Pudding - the cold dish (b/c it comes out in those platters) Beancurd wrap - piping hot. PRICE - ~$30 for two people. ? SERVICE - SLOW, the waiters don't look friendly and when you ask for something, they don't acknowledge that you asked them to bring something for you. (ie.hot chilli paste) AMBIANCE - Fairly clean and new. I like the chopsticks. Not sure if I will be back; maybe only for a special occasion or when I have relatives visiting from out of town and we don't want to trek up to SF.

I like this place. Their dim sum taste pretty good, and the restaurant is clean and not that crowded. I recommend their nuo mi ji, taro bum, and liu lian su. (the last 2 items are dessert) BTW, I won't suggest come here for later night dim sum (they have it as a promotion, since it's cheapre). First, the food doesn't taste fresh, make me feel it's left over from lunch; 2nd, not much dim sum choice.

This place is actually pretty good. Prices are steep, but I mean it's dim sum, if you're not careful that shit'll add up faaast! Came here for the first time last week for my boyfriends birthday breakfast (yes breakfast!) LOL we were soo excited we got downtown at around 1030. Anyway food is good. I only know the names of siu mai and char siu bao, so i have to go by looks for the others. Haha. The custard bun in yummy tho. Actually it's all pretty good :) The wait staff is a little hard to get a hold of tho, it gets pretty chaotic so when you need water it's like mission impossible. Otherwise they're nice.

Been here for birthday group dinner a few times and dim sum for once. The Good: Dishes, ingredients are not bad. Taste decent, too. They have a few of their own special dim sum menus. The Bad: Service can be bad when it's busy. Servers keep forget our requests, though they are nice. Some dim sum special menu can taste bad... The price is on the rather high side.

Great place for Dim Sum if you do not want to go outside Mountain View. No other place in Mountain View offer Dim Sum. Dinner menu not too bad, but a little expensive compare to other restaurant in Milpitas or San Jose. Does no give any free soup. Service is varies from time to time. Some time you can get a very good service, but sometime they forget to serve all entree until you almost done. So make sure you have to remind them if you notice the food does not serve on time. Not too bad, you can try it out if run out of place to eat.

Decent place, given it is in Mountain View. ?Went there on Sunday, after the farmer's market. Selection felt small, although they have people running around with trays hawking goods. ? Quality is overall good. ?Commenting on what I ate: ? ? ?The shrimp dumplings are tightly packed and seem very fresh. ? ? ? ? Chicken feet ?is so-so. ? ? ? ? The spare ribs are low-quality and too fatty and sinewy. ?I had to TRY to discretely yank out the tendons that get caught in my teeth.... ? ? ? The baked pork buns are nicely puffy with finely diced pork meat. ? ? ? The lotus-leaf wrapped sticky rice was excellent. I noticed they use less sodium, which is good. Service is normal. ?Nothing spectacular. ?We arrived early--around 11am so it wasn't too busy. Pricing was reasonable. ?Easy in-and-out for us. Just nothing to wow me. ?Or maybe I'm used to energy from the crowd which was lacking since I was there early? Anyways, 2.5 to 3.

I only come here for the after 9 pm dim sum. They have a couple of awesome dishes for mondo cheap - beef brisket with supreme broth, clay pot minced beef with egg, and the various dim sum items. Food is pretty solid overall, but a bit too pricey any other time of day. Service is hit or miss, with the waitresses sometimes totally indifferent to you unless you can break out the canto / mandarin. Which I can't do well :P

Mediocre dim sum but convenient spot for a big lunch group. I'm not particularly impressed by the dim sum here, although they're not bad. The dim sum is not as good as Saigon in Sunnyvale or Koi Palace in Daly City. The service is so-so, they seem to have troubles taking away the empty dim sum trays from the table. The upside about this restaurant is it's conveniently located on Castro Street. Also, they have tables that fit up to 10 people and they're not too busy during lunch time. So if you have a big group, this is the place to be. However, if you want good dim sum, go somewhere else.

I'm probably destined to dislike any dimsum place that's not in NY... but I will try to be as unbiased as possible. I went on a Sunday (early afternoon). ?The food is good, seating was quick and the staff was friendly. ?I personally just though there wasn't enough variety and so kept getting the same ladies trying to "sell" me the stuff I "rejected" only two minutes ago. ?But otherwise, I'll definitely be back (unless I find a better spot)...

Ate dim sum here on Sunday, during busy lunchtime. PRO: -wait for seating wasn't that long -not too rude host/hostess -very attentive waiters/waitresses -all the carts visit all the tables, including the upstairs tables -elevator. allows families with strollers to be seated upstairs. -table was constantly checked for empty dishes -efficient and caring staff CON: -people who wash dishes don't clean well enough or some waiters have dirty hands. a bowl given to me for the rice porridge has hard crusted edges and was greasy. however, a waiter instantly attended to my needs and got me a very clean bowl -the restaurant defaults on charging tea at $1.00 per person. before we sat at our table, the waiter asked us if we wanted tea. we said no; we just want water only. when they tallied up our check, the tea was added in and charged us $1.00 per person. luckily, the waiter who got us our water verified that we did not order tea and changed our check. i'm not trying to be cheap, but seriously, i didn't order something, so i don't want to be charged for it. dim sum lunch came out to be $15 per person.

I had a horrible experience here. ?The food was ok; there was nothing special about it. ?But the customer service, just like most Asian restaurants, is terrible. 3 plates for $10 so we ordered 12 plates. ?They made a mistake of giving us 2 plates of one item istead of two plates of another. ?Instead of fixing it, the lady told us that it's not their fault , and now we should just order another 3 plates (for an extra $10 in their pockets) to fix the mistake. ?I also did not appreciate that the lady was staring down my boyfriend (when he vocally complained about their service). ?It really doesn't cost much for them to give us a small plate of noodles to fix the botched order. ?Had they done that, we would've gone back. You get cheap food, so you get bad service, my friend says. Well,I get better service at a McDonald's. PS. I remembered just now that I also got nagged for taking too mcuh time to order when all I was asking was if they have mango pudding.

Love the late night dim sum (open until midnight! So rare for this area...)- 3 items for $10. The porridge is a small bowl but was enough for two people to share. The food was definitely oily but delicious and hit the spot for a hungry girl on a freezing night. Service is ehh, as expected for a chinese establishment.

3.5 star. New Cantonese-style seafood restaurant on the Castro block. The deco was modern and you can see they took time. Service, being new and all, was good. We went for dinner, and the place was completely filled after 7:30. Most of the Cantonese dishes tasted good, not much complaints in the tasting. But I wouldn't recommend ordering non-Cantonese dishes at these restaurant, because that would just totally defeat the purpose of going to these restaurants. The dishes that stood out for me were - golden fried pork ribs, braised beef with soup, and bbq pork in the appetizer plate.

I hadn't been to Fu Lam Mum since it was across the street. Had a very good dim sum experience on Easter sunday. Seven of us in our clan went to have dim sum since it was centrally located for all of us. We arrived around 11:40 and got a table right away. Everyone agreed dim sum was very good and reasonable for $66ish for 7 people before tip. Service was good for a Chinese restaurant - meaning people were friendly and prompt. Unless it is some high-end Chinese restaurant, friendly, quick and prompt is what one hopes for when it comes to most Asia-fare restaurants. Didn't realize it was open till the wee hours too most days. That's a plus for late night cravings! New digs on Castro are much better than the former location on the other side of the street. Verdict: good dim sum on this trip. Willing to explore this place further.

I was asked after coming here whether or not it was the best dim sum place in Mountain View. ?I replied sure, considering it's the only place I've ever had dim sum in Mountain View. ?To be honest, it's less of a kudos to how good the place is and more of a knock on the state of dim sum in Mountain View. ?I came with a fairly large group on Sunday for lunch, since we were seeing off some guys from our church who were going to Cambodia for a mission trip. In regards to the food, the dim sum was pretty run of the mill. ?There wasn't anything exceptionally great about it, though, because the tea wasn't refilled regularly, the grease tended to build up when eating, making it hard to get through everything. ?We also ordered some noodles, seafood crispy noodles and beef chow fun I believe, both were remarkably flavorless. ?If you really want to have dim sum in Mountain View, I suppose you could do worse, but honestly, if you really want dim sum, don't go to Mountain view.

The dim sum chef did a real good job at the following: -any dumpling (i.e. shrimp ball, scallop ball, spinach ball, rice noodle) -deep fried salty dumpling -little dish of "gui fei" chicken However, the tea is not good with a normal charge of $1 per person.

As a long-time Mountain Viewer, I dined in this restaurant for a couple of times, whether it's a company lunch or a family get-together, I always had a good time as the food is good here. However, today is not my lucky day, as I encountered one of the most ridiculous things in my dining experience. ?After the meal, we paid the bill in cash, and was waiting for the change coming back. But after a while, nothing returned to us. So we checked with a waitress. She asked the cashier where is our change, then we heard him yell over the counter that he considered those are all tips because 'it's just a little bit of money'. What? ?it's over 20% of our bill, and he just took it without even asking us? They don't provide table service, and it's not a 5-star restaurant, how can they claim a 20% tip for a small group WITHOUT our permission? ?Since we insist, he finally returned the money to us. But when we made the tip, we found there's still short of one dollar in the change. Though it's only $1, but it's so nasty and dishonest of them to take away guests' money in every possible way. The table leader who dealt with this issue also managed it in a very ridiculous way. Instead of checking with the cashier (the cashier just walked out as if he has nothing to do with it), she purposely blamed on the other waitress in front of us that she should carefully count the money before she handed it to the cashier. I felt I totally cannot communicate with these people. And I don't think they have manager on site, otherwise the manager should already hear everything because it happened in front of the guests. I felt such a shame for them. And of course I will never go to this restaurant or recommend it to any of my co-workers and friends again.

I visited the restaurant and I ordered Rock cod with tender green(s). I know the plate, it's one of my favourites so I normally know what to expect. This time I got a plate that wasn't really good tasting. Some of the fish was partially raw, the sauce was not really tasty and the whole thing did not meet my expectations. The place is nice, big and elegant but some people tend to get noisy. The plate I chose was not super. Maybe they serve better food. The menu looks really nice. I have wanted to eat at Fu Lam Mum for a while. Maybe I'll visit again and try something else next time.

Fu Lam Mum is probably one of the most authentic, no frills Cantonese food restaurant in the south bay outside of SF Chinatown. ? Nicely priced without being over priced. ?Efficient and brisk service without the pretense. ?It seems to be open everyday of the year. ?When you need a Chinese food fix after 9pm, head for Fu Lam Mum. ?Ask for the after 9pm menu and you will be surprised that these are the most popular Cantonese dishes at lower prices. ? You will notice the place gets crowded between 9pm and midnight 'coz everyone knows the value they're getting. ?If you speak and read Chinese, then you'll be in for some real treat. ?You can order snake soup, lamb stew and other exotic delicacies not in their regular menu.

I went for lunch today and was surprised that they served dim sum! There aren't many dim sum places in the Mountain View/Palo Alto area, so I was very excited to try it out. And it was good! Even my mother-in-law thought so, and she's from NYC so she compares everything to Chinatown and Flushing. They offered the traditional dim sum dishes and I was impressed by the taste and quality. The shrimp dishes had huge shrimp, not tiny little ones that you get at some other places. The only thing that I had that I did not like was the spring roll--something was a little off with those so I will not be getting those again. The new restaurant is modern, clean and bright--a huge improvement from the old place. The variety and assortment may not compare with Dynasty (Cupertino), but the food is good and the location in Mountain View is so convenient.

This review is for dinner only It's HORRIBLE experience 1. Waitress seemed to be angry with someone/thing. Or she was just too tired and they should have hired more ppl. We felt scared by her face. BTW, most of the staff are not Cantonese, which means this place probably doesn't offer authentic seafood (Cantonese style) 2. 30 Minutes passed after they took our order and we still had no food on the table. Talked to the man in the suit, stupid dude told us kitchen was busy. WTF!? If you couldn't afford to bring food out fast, don't open such a big place, you moron! He didn't even seem a bit sorry. And it took 42 minutes for them to get us our first dish. 3. Even though we were so hungry due to the long wait, the food still tasted HORRIBLE. Chinese cooking doesn't mean soak everything in soy sauce, you dumb a$$! I mean, literally, EVERYTHING SOAKED in SOY SAUCE. So freaking salty! Sodium doesn't cause high blood pressure any more? I dint know why people give this place any star at all. I would have given it a ZERO STAR if possible. Actually, the friend who suggested the place was so embarrassed that she kept apologizing all thru dinner. And we have so far decided to not let her choose restaurant for a while. Avoid the place. BTW, parking is impossible in DT Mtview around dinner time Saturday, that is not their fault. But after spending so much effort finding parking, given what we had got from this place, we were just so UPSET!

If you're looking for Dim Sum in Mountain View- come to Fu Lam Mum! I can't even tell you how long I've looked for a dim sum place in the Palo Alto/Mountain View/Sunnyvale area, and after trying over 6 places, Fu Lam Mum is the best there is, and even ranks up there in the best dim sum I've ever had! I ate there on a Sunday morning with my brother, my original dim sum companion back when we first tried it in London, and we were thoroughly impressed with everything- the price was right, the food was hot and delicious and they had all the favorites. Their Char-siu (bbq pork buns)- which are the dealmaker for me- were to die for... SO yummy. But I was also impressed that even less familiar items looked delicious. ?I tried a couple of dishes I'd never thought I'd like, but were equally remarkable. I know reviews say it's too commercial, and not the normal, chaotic dim sum place, but it was bustling, clean and just a wonderful experience. The service was quick, friendly and constant. I would go back every weekend, heck everyone night, if it weren't for my diet, but Fu Lam Mum is now the place I go to splurge on yummy and authentic dim sum!

Unlike most other dim sum restaurants, they serve nice hot dim sum during lunch time. One of the few restaurants where I can eat my favorite tomato beef fried noodle! Ok service depending on your luck. Some China'ese waitresses are really rude! In that case, give $0 tips and write 'rude service' on the tips field!

Late night dinner specials and dim sum! yay! ?Late dinner is $8/dish and dimsum is choose any 3 dishes for $10. ?Good late plates are: ? sizzling black bean fish claypot chicken (this is actually served in a little wok) seafood tofu (sounds yucky, but delicious soft tofu with seafood and meat topping steamed in a lotus leaf). Not on the menu, but you can ask for Hong Kong style chow mein -- this is thin egg noodle, crisp on both sides and topped with delicious spicy beef and veggies -- yummy! reasonably priced and excellent, friendly service. ?Consistently 4.5 stars

Last Wednesday night for dinner with daughter who is here on business for the day. Had the sea bass with bok choy, eggplant with tofu claypot and the house special fried rice. Very tasty and generous portions. Made reservation with Ben for 8 for Mother's Day dim sum. As usually, dim sum was excellent (only negative was they forgot about our Fried Daikon Cake). However, there were enough variety so I forgave them. I guess we just love this place for Dim Sum!

I came here after a graduation at around 8:45 and there were still quite a lot of people at the restaurant. ?We were eating with family members and my mom ordered one of those dinner sets they offer. ?It included soup, spicy fish with black bean sauce, beef and scallop with bell pepper, walnut prawns, tofu cooked in bamboo steamer, bamboo fungus with mustard greens, and other dishes that I can't seem to remember. The dishes actually came out at a pretty good speed. ?Unfortunately, while I was munching on a bamboo fungus, I found a metal shaving from those metal sponges. ?I was dumbfounded for a few seconds, and then the waitress offered to bring out a different dish as damage control. ?Props to her for that, grossed out by the metal shaving. ?She brought out the spinach with salty egg instead, which I didn't really like since I don't like salty egg. I also came here with my family on another occasion for the late night dinner specials which were also quite good. ?We ordered the beef brisket soup, eggplant (not spicy) clay pot, and the fish stomach clay pot. ?All were very good and affordable. -1 star for the metal shaving, but other than that, quite good.

Good for post 9pm meals only. Dim sum is sub-par. Food is overall expensive. Next door (same owner) is a better bet for lunch or dinner.

Overall: 7.5/10 Ambience: 6.5/10 Large spacious dining area, very typical design and layout for a large Chinese restaurant. Having a second floor helps during peak hours. Unfortunately, I don't think Fu Lam Mum has any private function rooms (correct me if I'm wrong!) -- usually bigger restaurants have such rooms for events. Food: 8/10 Portions are generous, and the quality is there. Authentic southern Chinese cuisine. The food menu is quite comprehensive. Service: 8/10 Very friendly service staff. The manager, Simon, is usually very attentive too. There was once when their service was extremely slow, but they made up for it by giving free dessert. Value: 7.5/10 Inexpensive; prices are about what you'd expect from a typical Chinese restaurant. As usual it depends on what you order. The late night menu (after 9pm) is very worth it. Portions are huge.

Just moved to the Peninsula from NYC, and I'm so glad I found this place! Been exploring different Chinese places, but I have not been that impressed -- Pan Tao, for example. Am I in California or what?! My mother was coming to visit, so I decided to do some research on my own, and I am so glad to have found Fu Lam Mum. We went for dim sum, and the food was yummy and clean. I definitely noticed how less greasy and more legit the dim sum is, compared to many places back on the East Coast. THIS is what I was expecting. The selection was sufficient, especially for a suburb on the peninsula, right? We asked for a durian pastry but it was taking too long, so we had to cancel the order. It's okay though, I still got love for this joint. Some friends and I came back a couple of weeks later for late night dim sum, and we had a good time. Late night dim sum is rare, so I was definitely feeling it. If we had been drinking earlier, it would have been just as much fun to roll in and get some late night dim sum. The selection was not as broad but definitely sufficient to fill the munchies.

Ever since they relocated down the street, I've been a frequent eater here at Fu Lam Mum. If you want classy Chinese food, this is pretty much your only option in downtown Mountain View. Ben (the owner) and Simon (a manager) are awesome. They've helped me pull off many a family dinners over the past few years. ?Their roasted duck is especially delicious. But outside of the banquet options, we usually like to go on weekends for dim sum during the days and late night on weeknights for their 9pm specials. The only drawback I've experienced is that sometimes at night, its nearly impossible to flag down a server. A few times, we've had to wait nearly 20 minutes before our server was able to take our order or refill our water.

Hey the owner worked really hard to get here. He used to be a server at the other chinese restaurant down the street. He's done a nice job decorating the inside and it's a hot spot for the various chinese holidays: like lunar festival and new years. The food's pretty good, but more geared towards asian clientele. I'd give it a 3.5 stars but I'm giving the guy credit for working his butt off to make this place. He doesn't leave until 2 am sometimes. The price is okay.

So basically, I went there last night for the second time ever. I went a few years back with a friend and remember being somewhat unimpressed by the food and really unimpressed by the prices. Anyways, I moved to Mountain View a bit ago and last night my friend and I decided that we wanted Chinese so we walked into Fu Lam Mum. The service took incredibly long (40 mins before food), the food itself was mediocre, and they charged us for a dish they never brought out. The situation: two college kids walk into Fu Lam Mum on a Saturday night. They leave, still hungry, and having paid $55 bucks for a meal that was "whatever" taste and quality. The moral of the story? F YOU lam mum. Go there knowing that it may ruin your evening as it did mine.

My husband and I really appreciate and good tasty food; so from time to time we like to venture out and check out restaurants we've never been before. We decided to stop by this resturant for dim-sum after we checked out Sunnyvale Farmer's market for the first time. ? The main reason we decided to check out this place was because I remembered there was a line last time I walked by this place. ?So, it got to be pretty good right? ?Wrong! We got there around 10:30 am. There were already few tables filled. But the restaurant is not busy at all. ?A cart came by quickly and we ordered the usual dim-sum - round steam bun, shrimp dumpling, shao-mai, a tofu wrapped dish. ?I took a bite of shao-mai and noticed the skin were tougher than usual; then I tried the round stream bun (one of my husband and my favorite). ?Ick, it's got a very strange flavor; not like any of the steam bun I've had (and I've had many). ?I moved on to the tofu-wrapped dish; hum not great! Finally, the shrimp dumpling is OK, but still not great (the wrap seems a bit dry and tough like shao-mai). ?Overall, nothing we've had seem fresh nor well made. ?This is definitely not quality dim-sum that I was expecting. The experience got worst as no other carts ever came by again! ?We've seen wait staffs walking around, buffing utensils, chatting with each other, filling carts with food, but NOT serving them! The restaurant is not busy at all, yet all of us are waiting and not being served. ?The wait staffs just kept on doing whatever they are doing as if there are no customers! After waiting for over 15 minutes with no new food coming out (yet we can see them putting on the carts), we decide to pay our bill and just leave. If the food were great but the service is bad, we "might" put up with it once in a while. ?But horrible food and bad services? ?Forget it! We will definitely never come back to this restaurant again.

I came here because all my friends raved about it. We got there a few minutes after they opened and there were already two parties seated. I should have known this place was sketch when I saw a waitress checking tea cups that were already on tables and dusting the inner portions off with one of those yellow shammys that you would use for your car. We got a few pieces of baked pork buns and the egg tarts. Those were really good. We also ordered walnut shrimp, orange chicken, pan fried noodles, and BBQ pork fried rice. These items we usually get at other chinese restaurants to compare food. The noodles and shrimp were good. The chicken and fried rice were bland. As we are eating the food, I look at the ledge to my left (we sat by the windows of Castro St) and I see a bug crawling and trying to get to the table. Then I moved my placemat and found a dead bug there too! I'd probably only get their baked pork buns to go if I ever dare go back there. Bugs are bad news.

Good place for dim sum that's popular on the weekends. I almost always come here for dim sum but it does get pretty packed around lunchtime on the weekends. The food comes out hot, they have a pretty good variety of ? dishes, and it's not super expensive. It's nicer and cleaner than a lot of chinese places too. They also have this dessert bun that has taro inside that's awesome! It's called snow white something in chinese? I can never remember what it's called. But it's a super tasty way to top off your meal. They also do a pretty good job with pan fried noodles whether with beef, chicken, or seafood. They give a decent amount of meat toppings with the noodle, so it's not like 90% noodle and 10% meat, which always pisses me off when that happens at a Chinese restaurant. The noodles are also nice and crispy but not burnt which is also critical. Definitely a good place to try for dim sum!

Disappointing: salty, heavy/greasy and expensive. Prior to the move and expansion, FLM was a haven for late night dining at reasonable prices for southern chinese style fresh seafood (particularly liked their steamed fresh/live fish and yee-fu noodles). The food has unfortunately taken a turn for the worst since they have moved; what's more, the price has been jacked up... :-( Dim sum is heavy (w/ the exception of chicken feet, which is one of the few satisfactory dishes they are serving), cooked-to-order vegetables are also messed up. Do not recommend it.

We strolled downtown Mountain view this Sunday at noon, and noticed that surprisingly, all restaurants were empty. All but Fu Lam Mum, going full throttle! Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of Dim Sum... and some items on the menu seemed a little bit weird (chicken feet? Really?) But everything we ordered (for 8 of us) was delicious and the service was swift! My 2 favorites were the rolled rice noodles and the chicken sesame buns. Can't wait to go back!

One, if not the only, of the few Chinese places in downtown Mountain View that are in the category (or at least trying to be) of Mayflower (in Milpitas, San Francisco and Millbrae), Joy Luck (Cupertino) and Dynasty (San Jose). The main dining room is open, spacious and contemporary. None of that gaudy red and gold decor. There is a second floor but I have not gone up there. Fresh seafood in tanks. I have been here twice with small and large parties and the service has been good. When we ordered fresh seafood, they would catch the creatures from the tanks and bring it to your table for inspection (I don't know if that's standard practice when it's crowded...I would imagine other patrons not appreciating the water from the unhappy fish). The food is good but I feel the prices are way too high for what you get. $15 for walnut prawns?!?! ?Bok choy I think was like $10. We ordered the following food (party of 10): Minced beef soup, walnut prawns, salt and pepper spare ribs, lobster mein, yang chow fried rice, whole ginger and scallion chicken, fresh steamed striped bass, garlic baby bok choi, a soda, 4 orders of white rice...grand total....$210!!! Is it just me or is that a bit much? I would have given this place 4 stars for service - cuz at a Chinese restaurant, that's hard to come by - but I had to downgrade to 3 for their prices.

This place is our best Hong Kong style dim sum in the Bay Area! We bring all of our friends that appreciate good authentic Chinese food here ever since we first tasted the ?consistently delicious food. The wait staff is friendly and efficient and the ingredients are fresh. ? We've tasted pretty much everything that they bring by on the carts, and our favorites are the various Shao Mai and Chang Fen dishes, eggplant, the sweet sesame & red bean ball (dessert) with the Da Dou Miao (Snow Pea Shoots) as the leafy green dish that we order from the menu. The atmosphere is OK (highly evocative of an actual restaurant you might find in Asia) and the decor is a little sterile, but the good news is that the restaurant is very clean. ?If you're going on a weekend, make sure to get there before 11am if possible to avoid the lines, which invariably end up out the door and down the street by noon.

We have been to regular dim sum on weekends but recently heard about the midnight snack version. ?So after nine pm you can have three dim sum dishes for 10 dollars including bowls of porridge (jook). ?WOW this is sweet! ?My wife and I shared three one nite after nine and it was just enuf for a snack and to hit our craving. ?What a DEAL! ?Anyway this is our new late nite snack trip!!! What could be better after a movie? I was especially fond of the taro/minced beef porridge...taaaasty!

Fu Lam Mum - A Tale of Two Restaurants I believe that there is a type of Cantonese restaurant that has two faces. ? One is the evening dinner. ?This type of restaurant has many of the typical Cantonese offerings typical of banquets such as Crispy Chicken with Shrimp Chips and also other Hong Kong specialities such as Hong Kong Chow Mein. ?However, must must be ready to plunk down a serious dollar amount since this is the type of restaurant where a dish can cost you $20-45 depending on if it is a seafood dish. ?The service was so-so and I had the distinct feeling that our party of two was easily dismissed for not being a banquet table. ?Although I did notice that ?a large banquet table was served rather slowly as well.... The second face is that of a dim-sum brunch place. ?This offering is much cheerier, with ladies bustling about with typical carts offering most of the usual favorites such as spareribs, tofu skin rolls, siu mai, xia jiao, barbecue pork buns, and sticky rice with chicken. ?These were all tasty, although the bbq pork buns seems strangely orange and not quite the bright red I expect from my Oakland chinatown dim sum places. ?But I guess the thing to say is that it is all pretty much tasty, despite the ranting of other reviewers. ?The service was 30% better than the dinner, although it wasn't too busy so who knows what happens when there's a full house... This place is like Peony Restaurant in Oakland Chinatown, but definitely less busy at least if you arrive on a weekday night or early morning for brunch. ?I would definitely recommend it for a nice brunch or a fancy banquet, though not for a casual dinner.

Food was decent/average. However......... rice rolls were AWFUL!!!! I'm not talking about the beef or shrimp rice rolls, I'm talking about the plain rice rolls they fry on the little cart. When it came, it was literally one big mound of fried rice flour... we couldn't make out that they were supposed to be rolls, not could we separate easily any individual rice roll. The manager however was quick to refund us that dish and was very understanding when we pointed this out to him. Decor and seating is nice. Overall price was reasonable for lunch. Fuk Kin fried rice was very nice.

My three friends and I hit this place up for late (9pm) dim sum. ?We were given a table next to the back exit / kitchen and it was awhile before anyone came by to take drink orders. That said, the food was TASTE-EE! ?If there's an upside to sitting by the kitchen, it's your food comes out piping hot. We ordered some dim sum, and some unadventurous main dishes. The steamed pork buns, Mongolian beef and Sweet and Sour Chicken were crazy good. The BBQ pork fried rice was a bit greasy and unseasoned but my girlfriends raved about the shrimp dumplings which I passed on. Other than the rather cold reception we received the only other drawback is the sterile atmosphere of the place. The lighting is identical to my high school cafeteria and so was the stale vibe. The aesthetics could best be described at utilitarian. Forget any sexy textiles or pleasing wall hangings. The name of the game here is good eatin.

The Dim Sum isn't great, but it is a bargain, quick, and they are open late! When I was studying at Foothill, I loved dropping by to get dinner after a night class. Always ask about specials before ordering. The staff is varied, some are plain offstandish (perhaps not fluent in English), whilst others (especially later at night, Foothill students usually) can be really chill. It's a great place for a quick bite, or a cheap monster meal. They are conveniently open early and late, and they are more affordable than Ming's (though the quality isn't as great as... but you get what you pay for). If you haven't been here before, try it. It's a good place to sate the urge without driving to Chinatown or paying too much.

Last year our dear Chinese neighbors took us here and we had a great meal. Last Sunday evening we took other neighbors with us. They had never been here and they have been in the restaurant business so I was anxious to get their feedback. Their feedback was very good but probably slanted for their host. The walnut-prawns, which we all said was one of our favorites, came with way too much mayo and unseasoned walnuts on the side. We ordered some substitute beef (they were out of what we first ordered). ?It had way too much gristle and fat. ?The sauce was good. Proportions were small as well as the dining plates. ?We asked the waitress why the small plates and she mentioned something about the owner's liked them. Maybe small plates make the amount of food look larger. ?ha hah Dessert was a mango gelatin. ?It was so good I ordered another one. Service? . . . outstanding, and seating was immediate. I think this restaurant caters more to the dim-sum crowd.

Had dim sum here again this weekend and they were great. Been here a few times and the quality has been consistently good. The staff's friendly and attentive. Most staff speaks Cantonese (and probably Mandarin but I don't). They have the basic list of dim sum covered but nothing out of ordinary that you won't find anywhere else. Bonus that it has a parking lot in the back. It's shared with other business but usually no trouble finding a spot in there if you are there before 11 AM. On weekends, the place definitely starts to heat up around 11 AM. I recommend you get there 10 AM-ish.

this is my first time having an official Chinese dinner ever since i settled in the Bay area over a month ago. ?I read that they had late night dim sum special and wanted to try it out. I was extremely hungry after waiting for my bf's company meeting to end. ?He was finally finished by 9:30pm. ?While I was waiting, I searched for Chinese restaurant near the office and found Fu Lam Mum. Had the Shrimp Dumpling (har gaw), Steamed Spare Ribs (pai guat) and the glutinous rice ball dessert for the 3 dim sum combo. The Shrimp was quite surprising and not like those soagy cheap frozen har gaw that some cheap restaurants serve. ?The spare ribs was strange and unpleasant to me because they included the 'celery-like' taste of what was supposed to be n the beef balls dim sum and i dislike that taste. ?I asked for the dim sum dessert to be served later, but the owner said that cannot be done because all dim sum ordered at the same time are made together. ?I guess if I didn't order the combo, they could've made it separately. Then, I ordered a clay pot chicken. It came with a bowl of rice and is also part of the late night special of $8. ?The taste was good, but the chicken pieces were so tiny. I would come back again for late night, but probably not if I had other choices.

Love the dim sum and the bbq duck! ?Very yummy and reasonably priced. ?Don't expect great service though. ?Since my family loves the duck so much, we are willing to overlook the sloppy service. ?Although they have high-chairs, these chairs usually do not come equipped with a functional seat belt. ?Hence, best to bring your own.

I came here for dim sum twice. ?Once at night and once on a Saturday morning. ?Sitting on the second floor is definitely better since you can scope out which dim sums are being circulated. ?The food here is nothing special. ?The chicken feet is more on the sweeter side but the taro cakes and shui mai were delicious. ?The only disappoint (and reason for -2 stars) is because I had ask numerous times for egg tarts which is my favorite dim sum. ?After about 20 minutes of asking the ladies with the food carts and waiting, I gave up. I actually never been to a dim sum restaurant that ran out of egg tarts so this is pretty disappointing and unexpected.

In general, very delightful experience there. Pros: 1. it is unbelievably cheap, esp. their lunch special ($5.95, with rice and soup). The lunch special is valid for 7days a week, for both lunch time(11am-2:30pm) and night time(9pm-12am). The food is very good, considering the price. 2. They take credit card. Cons: 1. Not many choices available.

First time here. ?Wanted to try it since it was *packed* when we passed by on Mother's Day-- and it's a really big room, so there must be something good here, right? ?As some have mentioned, the pictures in the menu don't match actual entrees, they are provided "for reference only." ?Quirky, but no big deal. I got the broiled cod w/tofu in black bean sauce. ?The fish was actually batter fried, not broiled. ?Not bad. ?My date got the clear noodles with vegetables. ?The clear noodles were good, except for the one long black hair she slowly unthreaded from the plate. ?Grooosss. At least the manager took that dish off the bill, but it took a few minutes to negotiate that with the server, due to the language barrier. All in all, not a great first impression. ?We won't be back. Zoltan!

Went for dimsum on Saturday after the farmer's market with 3 friends. Arrived at about 11am and was seated right away. ?We got hot tea right away and about a minute later had a cart come over with lots of the staple steamed dim sum items. ?A few of the things we tried were the har gao, siu mai, sticky leaf wrapped rice stuff, and beef wrapped with noodles. ?The har gao and siu mai were kind of dry so I put soy sauce on it to make it better. ?Sticky was was good and so were the beef wrapped with noodle. ?Also had egg custard buns that had a really unnaturally orange colored custard in it but it tasted normal enough. ?In the end it came out to $38 for the 4 of us with 9 dishes. ?The food was okay but for that price we were pleased. As for if I'd go again, I think I'll stick to Joy Luck Place in Cupertino or maybe Mayflower in Milpitas.

I eat here at least once / week. ?The owner also owns Hong Kong Bistro next door, and the wait staff has always accommodated my special requests - even drink orders that normally come from the other side of the house.

This is my second-favorite dim sum place in the Bay Area. Though it doesn't measure up to Yank Sing in SF, the hour saved each way from Los Altos makes it our first choice when we are in a dim sum mood and not planning to spend the day in the city. Don't miss the sticky rice and shrimp and pork balls. Everything else we have had has been standard or better than standard. The one caveat--the menu during regular dinner hours is VERY expensive and doesn't seem to offer dim sum. I am not sure about late night.

Dim $um Dood again. It's time to shake yo ass, drink some tea and eat some bbq pork buns bitche$! http://www.youtube.com/w¡­ Skanky sister restaurant HK Bistro was full next door, so I had little choice but to duck into FLM and fly $olo. Late night Dim $ummer$ take note. Archie R was right. FLM serves Dim $um late at night. 9 pm and after they have a set of specials where for $10 you can have your choice of 3 of the following: Ha Gow - shrimp dumplings Siu Mai - ?shrimp and pork dumplings Jing Pai Gwut - Steamed pork ribs in black bean sauce Jing Fung Dzow - Steamed phoenix claws (aka chicken feet) Seen Juk Guen - Yuba roll with minced pork inside Yeh choy go - steamed cabbage cake Dau Mieu Gow - shrimp and pea sprout dumpling Lor Mai Gai - steamed sticky rice with chicken mushroom preserved sausage wrapped in lotus leaf Cha Siu Bao - bbq pork steamed buns Lai Wong Bao - steam custard buns Tseen Tsuhng Go - Thousand Layer Cake (salted egg layers in between) Dzeen Gau Choy Gow - pan fried chive dumplings (guaranteed to elevate your burp and fart gasses to the next level) Dzeen Lor Bak Gow - pan fried daikon cake Ham Shui Gok - Pan fried glutinous rice puff Wu Gok - Fried Taro Puff Dza Ha Gow - Fried Shrimp Ball Dzeen Dui - Fried Sesame Ball with red bean paste inside Luk Cha Dza Tong Yuen - Green tea fried ball (?) Pai Gwut Chun Fu Fun - pork chops with rice noodle soup See Yau Wong Chow Mein - vegetarian soy sauce fried noodles Heung Wu Ngau Sung Jook - taro and minced beef congee Seen Ha Suk Mai Jook - Shrimp and corn congee Gai Yung Nam Gwa Jook - minced chicken and pumpkin congee Pei Dan Sau Yuk Jook - Preserved duck egg and lean minced pork congee Good for the late night clubber, Dim $um seeker, late night stoner munchie or munchie stoner. But bottom line, my 2nd lunch visit was still an average meh, although a minor notch better than the first. This time the dim sum was generally served more hot than last time. Ha Gow skins literally tore apart easily when picked up by chopsticks (unless you are very careful and gentle). Not much variety today either, the typical classics and too much of certain items that they probably wanted to sell before bringing out new stuff. If you have time to kill maybe you can wait, but for a lunch on the run, just eat whatever they have, a few and then get outta here. I ordered one glass of ice water, and when the bill came I got charged $1.00 for tea. I let the manager who I think was the owner know and he said no problem he'll scratch it off. Then when I wanted to pay by credit card he asked for ca$h. Uhm no thanks next time. This is the second time that had happened, last time I asked for a pot of hot water, and still got charged $1 for tea, although they corrected it. And that makes me one $ad A$IAN CHEAPNE$$ glass of iced water. (No Ascii art needed, not for these guys).

Looking for authentic Cantonese cuisine without the need to visit Hong Kong? Come to Fu Lam Mum, you won't be disappointed. The menu features a wide selection of classic Asian dishes and the portions are generally quite large while pricing remains modest. This restaurant features large tables to accomodate large groups and family style eating, but pairs and individuals are welcome too.

Good dim sum. I'm subconsciously comparing it to Ocean Star, arguably the best dim sum place in California, and this place compares well. At least I don't have to fold your elbows in front of my chest or kicking your buddy in the crotch while you are eating a steamed leek dumping. I'm not a huge dim sum fan, because the variety is pretty limited after a while and the food can't be possibly prepared with the same level of care as regular entrees. That said, the food here is pretty tasty and dining experience is quite pleasant. More importantly, you don't have to wait till the weekend to enjoy the real dim sum like some other places. After all, dim sum means "morning tea", not "weekend tea".

After dining here with my family last weekend, besides being a good place for dim sum, it's also one of my new fave spots for dinner. :-) Not your place if you're looking for items like General Tsao's chicken, but if you want traditional Chinese fare, this is the one for you. I'm picky with 5 stars, but I would call this a 4.5. Highlights: - Set meals: authentic, great quality, good portions, and great price. I haven't had a Chinese set meal this good since my grandparents used to take the whole family out when they lived in this area. Excellent array of dishes that served party of 4-6 for $88. Don't remember the name of the menu but it was on the bottom left corner and the one at that price point. Several dishes and all fantastic. Here are the ones ?that I remember: -- Peking duck: small duck but great flavor. Enough crispy skin for the steamed pac-man shaped buns and enough meat on the bones to have that as well. -- Tofu: huge bamboo bin filled with a huge slab of firm steamed tofu topped with a gravy of pieces of seafood (scallops and shrimp), meat (chicken and duck), and veggies (mushrooms and circular slices of green stalky bean type thing). I've never had this before and I loved it! Gobbled so much of it up myself and had more to take home. -- Walnut prawns: lighty fried large prawns, super light on the sweet mayo (I'm not a mayo fan) and traditional sweet glazed walnuts. One of the best I've had. -- Flounder: cut into succulent pieces. Very fresh, as this place is known for their seafood. If you're squeemish, don't be scared by the skin that's left on or the deep fried tails on the plate. ;-) -- Beef: tasty and tender with the biggest mushroom stalks I have ever seen. - Came with a dessert: usually it's just bowl of some red bean mush, but we actually got to pick a dessert per person. :-) Mango jelly for some and a delish warm baked custard bun for me. My tummy left so happy. - Service: a Chinese place with great food AND service? No way! That was pretty cool to find. ;-) We got drinks when we wanted them, waters were refilled, and they even put a plate on top of our pecking duck buns so they would stay warm while we had other items. - I realized they are open late: midnight on weekdays and 1am on weekends. Always love good late night Chinese food options. Lowlights (my flip side to highlights): - It's so authentic, it makes me really miss my Chinese grandparents. :-( This place is definitely on my "hot tamale train" (for those of you who watch So You Think You Can Dance) and I'll be back time and time again!

I came here for a friend's birthday. ?I have to say that the dim sum was quite good. ?We ate here at night time so we didn't get to eat the dim sum until about 9pm. ?It was better than I expected. ?The service was could be a bit better. ?They forgot our drinks a lot of time, and didn't really refill the water as much as they could have, and it took them quite a while to get my friend's soda. ? Parking can get really packed in the streets so if you are new to the area, you can park in the parking lot that is FREE, but note that on a Saturday night it can get busy so you might be searching for awhile, but it is not as bad as the city. ?Food is pretty good. ?Just be patient with the service, and don't expect good service. ?Go and try for the food.

This is my new dim sum place. The wait can be a bit annoying, but it's totally worth it. I haven't tried their main menu, but if you want just dim sum, this is the place! I usually go on Sundays, around 1pm and the wait is not as bad then. Service is average, the water boy will ignore you once in a while, but flag down anybody and they'll bring you what you need. Well priced, great place to go with friends.

We went last night at 9pm for the late night menu - $10 for 3 dim sum items. The fact that they have a late night menu is great - more supper options! The choices were quite limited, but the dim sum seemed fresh made. That means you have to wait for the food - I think we waited about 30 minutes for our order of 6 dim sum dishes to be served. But the food came piping hot. Food quality was okay. I've tasted better, but I also tasted worse. Its quite adequate for a quick supper. I would definitely return if I ever find myself hungry at 9plus and want good, hot food.

At Fu Lam Mum, literally the wheels on the carts go round and round . . . until you are stuffed and have to turn them away. Dim Sum is the staple of this restaurant with shrimp dumplings costing $3.25 a plate and most dim sum plates ranging between 3 -5 dollars. Watch out for the dinner menu though where they serve food more Hong Kong style with bones and skin attached to chicken meat (as opposed to Chinese American food with good ol' chicken breast). It definitely gets crowded during lunch but I think it just adds to the experience. ?After all, who would want to go to an empty dim sum restaurant? ?They also have late night dim sum specials for that late night craving where you need something better than Jack in the Box. ?Be aware though that the late night dim sum list is abbreviated.

Came to this place with all of our family hoping for a fun and enjoyable family style dinner but instead got subpar food and awful service. The noodles were boring, the beef and chicken were bland, and the waiter had a massive attitude. We asked for her recommendation and she literally told us she didn't have time to "read the menu" for us. What??? We then had to GET UP twice to ask for items we needed and waited for our check until well after we finished eating. Save your money and spend it somewhere that actually wants it.

I am oblivious to everything else on the menu because when I come here I have my eye on the house fried rice. ?I can just eat that for a meal. ?It is not at all fried for one thing, more like lightly sauteed. ?It has plump little shrimp and pieces of pork that is tossed with all the typical fried rice veggies and eggs. ?What is different about it and what makes it taste great is the soft and moist texture. ?Apologies, but I cannot recall anything else on the menu even though I have eaten here dozens of times. ?But, the fried rice remains as clear as a bell.

An average dining experience. We ordered the prawn w/walnuts and the seafood bean curd. The boy found the prawns bland. I thought they were just average. The Seafood Bean Curd sauce was too salty. I tried a Seafood/eggplant dish that another person at my table had ordered. She liked my dish better so we exchanged and were both happy. Service was efficient, and they were very accommodating with multiple separate checks and placing our large group up in the balcony dining area separate from the main dining room.

Thought this was a decent place for a Cantonese dinner. They have a 6 person meal for 80 bucks - 5 dishes and 1 soup. Pretty good deal. We had 6 people and added 1 more dish for more variety, but it probably isn't neccessary if you aren't big eaters. Standout was a stuffed tofu, mushroom, eggplant trio dish, the steamed fish, and the house chicken (kwai fei chicken). Restaurant was a bit empty for an early dinner on a weekday - I'm gong to guess this place is more popular for dim sum lunch or late night dim sum. Still, the dinner was perfectly good, and I would return.

I know a Chinese restaurant's worth by the type of chili sauce its waiter produces when I do my usual flag-the-waiter-"hi-can-i-get-some-hot-sauce-?please" routine. ? The quality of the hot sauce is directly proportional to the quality of the food. Which is why I knew that, when a saucerful of Huy Fong chili garlic sauce was presented, we made the wrong decision to come here instead of Amarin across the street. ? We were right. ?Not only were the three dishes - rock cod in claypot with spicy sauce, beef short ribs, and house special fried rice - came out with 15-min interval of each other. ?The dishes were a parade of disappointment one after another. ?The rock cod was chewy due to copious amount of batter, the pot that it came in wasn't even made of clay. ?The beef short ribs were a poor rendition of kalbi, only nowhere near as juicy and flavorful as Sunnyvale's Myung Dong's or Jang Su Jang's. ?The house special fried rice was oily, bland and mixed with ridiculous amount of soggy lettuce shreds. ? All for $52. ? Panda Express would probably provide better value than this.

I came here during the lunch hour with a party of 7 from work. Service was terrible. We were seated on the top level and had to flag waiters several times. We weren't even finish saying what we needed before they walked off - so had to repeat the request. We had an added bonus of 3 people at our table who were able to speak cantonese but it didn't seem to matter. What was more is that we were always served last compared to the tables around us although we were closet to the stairs/kitchen. The food was okay, nothing spectacular stood out. The only thing I give them kudos for was their desert bun. It was a special dough with taro filled inside.

Not exactly what I expected but not bad either. I was hoping for awesome Chinese food, but what I got was just okay.

Decent canto food. I like Kirin (down castro towards el camino) better, because they give bigger portions and have more consistently good tasting food. Fu Lam Mum's food sometimes comes out very salty. I think they drench some of their stuff in too much soy/oyster sauce. Anyway, come after 9 for cheaper specials. I like their salt and pepper seasonings, but it's fried a little limp, and not crispy. The black bean beef is probably my favorite item, because it's so so so tender :D

I FLOVE THIS PLACE. I'm in good with the owner. He's a really great guy and I congratulate him for opening up his second resturaunt on Castro Street (Hong Kong Bistro)... I go to this place just about 1 to even 2 times a week. Because they offer such great food and if you go during lunch time, you recieve the lunch special prices. This is authentic chinese. No fuss or muss here. After 9pm, you also get the lunch special prices. This is usually the time it'll get packed. Free soup and rice with entree is always a good deal at about $5.00. I highly recommend coming to this place. You will not find another place better, unless it's the sister resturaunt. Just a footnote: They are more than happy to adjust a dish to the way you want it or you can even ask for things that are not on the menu. Just as long as it goes with thier style of cuisine. Obviously you can't ask them for Green Scallion Pancake, if you do they'll tell you to go next door or across the street. Everytime I go, I get pretty good services. They always provide me good services...

Honestly, if I could give this place ZERO stars, I would. In fact, I created my account right now, just so that I could complain about this place. I think I probably experienced the WORST customer service ever tonight. I had a waitress named Chung who was belligerent, rude, and condescending to my friend and I who came in to have a late dim sum dinner. My friend really wanted to order a specific shrimp dumpling dish but couldn't quite remember the name, so she described the dish and asked Chung if it was available and what it was called. Not quite understanding what she said, Chung proceeded to YELL at her about how it wasn't on the late night dim sum menu and that she couldn't order it. My friend, obviously taken aback, wasn't sure what to do and so just randomly ordered the first thing on the list because she wasn't quite sure what else to do. But that wasn't the end. Somehow, it just wasn't enough for Chung to be rude, but she had to screw up ALL of our orders except one! We ordered eggplant in garlic sauce (and specified it to not be cooked with meat as I am a vegetarian), two bowls of white rice, shrimp dumplings, shrimp and pork dumplings, and egg custard buns. What we got though was one bowl of rice, thousand layer cake, shrimp and chive dumplings, and eggplant in garlic sauce that contained chicken! The only thing she got right was the plain shrimp dumpling and even that wasn't exactly what my friend was looking for as she ordered hastily in order to avoid further confrontation with our waitress who obviously wasn't listening to anything we were saying anyway. Upset by being treated like complete crap as customers, my friend and I demanded to speak with the manager, who wasn't even around! Instead we talked to another waitress who obviously had no idea what to do and proceeded to just apologize half-heartedly and walk away to finish her conversation with other members of the waitstaff. I honestly cannot believe the terrible service we received, and to boot the food wasn't even that great. If you want real dim sum with a kind and attentive staff, then just drive down to Mayflower or ABC because honestly even though this place is a five minute drive from my house, the past two times I've been here have been horrible. The management of Fu Lam Mum really needs to take a good, hard look at the kind of staff they employ, because if the service is so bad as to make you want to drive an extra half an hour to the next closest dim sum place, then you know you have a major problem on your hands...

Came here for dim sum. Service was exceptional! It was easy to find someone for hot sauce and water. When I wanted something I didn't find in the carts, the lady was quick and nice about getting it in the kitchen for me. Everything was mediocre. The xiao long bao was not that good because the meat wasn't very tasty and the skin was a bit thick and chewy. I did like the custard buns!

Nice casual place to bring your kids. They will like looking at the fish, lobsters, crabs and jumbo prawns in the tanks. Friendly and professional wait staff. The regular menu has a nice selection. The cashew chicken is good. The plain vegetable dish was fresh but bland. They gave us a free mango pudding desert that was really yummy. Dim sum starts after 9:00.

We went here for rehearsal dinner on a busy Friday night a couple of weeks ago. Since we were a fairly large party, we were seated upstairs in an area sectioned off by discreet, beautiful and decorative Chinese wall dividers. ?The restaurant decor is modern with a strong Chinese decorative flair. It's not overly flashy and they used a more subdued color palette. Their serving ware is more modern and sleek but despite their good looks, they weren't as functional or easy to use as the plainer styles we've seen in other restaurants. I was really not a big fan of their tall water glasses (reminds me of the ones Yank Sing used back in the 80s) and their weighted chopsticks. The glasses were too tall/narrow, and got in the way of the lazy suzan. A few of us accidentally knocked over our glasses, spilling water onto the table and/or laps. As for the chopsticks, the capped metal at the top of the chopsticks made it top heavy -- we were forced to hold the chopsticks up higher -- making it a bit more harder to use. The food was really good. The dishes arrived warm, and the ingredients tasted fresh. The bride and groom ordered a banquet style, eight course meal for each table that included a variety of seafood, chicken, beef and vegetable dishes. We were stuffed silly. My favorite was their stir friend crab dish. For a Chinese restaurant, the waitstaff was attentive -- very similar to the other "nicer" Chinese restaurants like Hong Kong East Ocean in Emeryville. I would like to try their dim sum and hope to visit again. ?I agree with Jack T (San Jose) -- this is a restaurant for Chinese people.

Definitely come here for late night dim sum! They start serving it at 9PM, and you can get 3 dim sum dishes for $10 -- pretty cheap for the area. The food isn't fantastic, but it's one of the few dim sum places in the area and also one of the few real food places open late in Mountain View, period. It's normally pretty empty and I've never had to wait to be seated.

I have only been here for Dim Sum so my review is based on weekend morning Dim Sum experiences. ? Fabulous! ?The food is authentic and delicious. ?There's a great amount of variety to the choices. ?Service is fast and the managers in particular generally stop by every table to say hello. ?Simon in particular always takes the time to make my baby giggle when he sees us. ? My kids are 3 and 1 (VERY picky eaters) and in general difficult at restaurants. ?However, Dim Sum at Fu Lam Mum is something the entire family looks forward to. ?The children love the experience and trying new foods. ? We love it. ? My husband always goes for the steamed pork buns- excellent. ?I am a huge fan of the seaweed salad. ?Delicious. Tip: Go early- as in right when they open if possible, the lines can be insane around lunchtime. ?If you go when they open, you'll get a table immediately, fast and friendly service.

More like a 3.5 to 3.75, but will round up for cheap and satisfactory late night grub. ?We got the braised fish and tofu in clay pot, which had a nice balance to it. ?The salt and pepper fish (we had ordered salt and pepper shrimp, but this came out instead) and wasn't in the mood to bicker and wait, so oh well. ?Good decision, probably my favorite dish of the three we got. ?Wasn't overly salty like a lot of the other Chinese restaurants and not smothered in batter; surprisingly well made. ?The Hong Kong style pig intestines were also good if you're into that kind of food. ?Owner had to ask me twice and remind it was was intestines, lol. ?I'm like yup, I know, I always go for those type of things. ?Only qualm about it was I felt the garlic was a bit too roasted and a little overpowering. ?Other than that, was an enjoyable late night meal and relatively cheap as well. ?~$30 bucks for 3 dishes and tons of food.

my co-workers and i were sent here on a high recommendation. we decided to check it out for a birthday lunch and it was a memorable choice, to say the least. the dim sum carts and vendors were aggressive and much too frequent for my liking. i was too busy saying "no thanks" for the first half of our meal to enjoy the company of my table. the place was also SO incredibly LOUD. we had to pretty much yell to talk to the person sitting next to you. it is a nicely remodeled and beautiful two story venue, but the busyness and carts can kinda kill the ambiance. we ordered several dishes off of the lunch menu. the quality of the food and meat was above average for most Chinese restaurants [especially compared to those on castro] and it was very affordable. if you are chinese or a big fan of dim sum, you could have a very different view on this place than i. a chinese co-worker of mine was pleased to see many traditional dishes on the menu. with all of that said, i'm not too sure i'll go here again.

Was just here for Sunday brunch with a friend. ?We walked in and were quickly seated in the downstairs area with no wait, which was lucky because by the time we left they had opened the upstairs and there was still a wait outside. ?Jasmine tea and water were brought to the table within seconds, and like any dim sum place, the ladies with their carts wasted no time in approaching us. ?Can't remember all that we ordered, but it was all vegetables or shrimp as my friend doesn't eat meat. ?There were lots of options, and it seemed that all the staples I'm used to were available. ?I do remember dessert though, the egg custards were very good, as were the sesame balls. ?As a comment to other people's reviews here, our waitress was very helpful and spoke english well, which was useful when trying to communicate with the servers, as their english was close to non-existent. ?I'm glad that I knew what some of the items were, as my friend had not had dim sum before and I think we would have been overwhelmed had it been both of our first time here. If I lived in the area, I would try to come in here for the late-night (after 9pm) special - 3 dim sum dishes for $10. ?Even at brunch though, prices were very reasonable. ?Having been to some of the places in the city that are a bit pricey, I always worry as the servers stamp away on the card that I have no idea how much money I'm spending. ?For the two of us to eat brunch today, the total, including tip, was $30 - that's pretty fantastic if you ask me!

It's Christmas Day. ?You're Jewish, on vacation in California, and looking for a place to have lunch. ?Unfortunately, not many restaurants are open, unless, of course, they are run by people who do not celebrate Christmas. ?This very situation was the one my mom, my aunt and I were stuck in on Christmas Day 2009. ?Since we all really love sushi, we were looking for a decent sushi restaurant in the area that just happened to be open, but all the places my aunt had suggested were closed, so at my aunt's suggestion, she, my mom, and I went to Fu Lam Mum. ?I had never had Dim Sum before but am always open to trying new things, so I thought, why not give it a try? It happened to be a bit hectic that particular day, since apparently, at least in Mountain View, in addition to the so-called American Jewish tradition of eating Chinese food on Christmas, it is a Chinese tradition as well. ?They do have a menu but one of the things that makes Fu Lam Mum unique is how the waitstaff walks around with the Dim Sum on carts, but it gets to be a bit noisy amidst the customers all talking and the waitstaff all running around trying to accommodate everyone who orders things off the menu and wheeling around whatever they're wheeling around on their carts. ?Since the lower level seating area was packed, we were seated upstairs, which was also pretty packed, but we were happy to at least get seated moments after we arrived. ?I would imagine, though, on a day other than Christmas it would not be as crowded, but for it to be that packed, they must be doing something right, eh? Nonetheless, I was satisfied, and so were my mom (who opted out of Dim Sum and ordered tofu instead) and my aunt. ?I would definitely come back here if I were visiting again.

I really like this place. Honestly, I've only ordered off the lunch/late-night menu where everthing is $6, but eveything I've had on it was quite tasty. You can get get a whole, braised, tilapia or a plate of oysters for just $6!!! That's a bargain. And I love that soup they give you at night (at lunch it's hot & sour soup, which I'm not a fan of in general).

Cantonese style restaurant. We went there for dinner instead of dim sum, so not sure what the quality of dim sum there is like. Dinner we ordered: 1) Crab meat soup- it was ok, wasn't the best soup we've had. When we asked for vinegar (which is very common when you have seafood soup in Chinese restaurant) they didn't give us the thick dark vinegar, which was disappointing. 2) Pecking style pork rib- was a bit too sweet and fatty, we definitely had better pecking style pork rib in other Chinese restaurant 3) Tong Choi/Kong xin cai (water spinach) with sauteed fuyu: the vege was quite fresh, wasn't too tasty, but it certainly came in a big portion! 4) Seafood eggplant clay pot- this was probably the best dish out of the all. They gave big scallops and shrimps in the dish. All in all, not too bad.

First off, if you're hoping to have a conversation, look elsewhere. This place is LOUD. High ceilings with no baffling, and not a lot of soft surfaces. I wasn't too impressed with the food. We ordered the eggplant in garlic sauce, and it came out with chicken. Which wasn't mentioned on the menu. Good thing I'm not a vegetarian. The chicken in black bean sauce was super-oily, and the chicken was mostly fat and gristle. The service was mostly attentive, though. The food came quickly, they refilled our water glasses (though it took two requests to actually get water in the first place)...I wanted to like the place, because the servers were friendly and clearly cared, but the food was just so dramatically "meh" that I don't expect to ever go back.

I cannot resist the temptation of dim sum! Even strolling by on a Sunday afternoon & seeing a line of people, we still decided to wait. The thought of succulent har gow was making me salivate. We were seated very quickly & YAY the magical silver carts came to our table & there were no disappointments. Most dim sum places I have been to before had very rude service. However, at Fu Lam Mum everyone was very sweet & pleasant. : ) A smile goes a long way...& not being of Asian decent, the waitresses were really kind & explained the dishes to us. Thank you!

Thank heavens for Fu Lam Mum. ?After returning to the Peninsula from LA, I was so utterly saddened by the local selection of Chinese food around my new place in Palo Alto. ?I was appalled by how tasteless, oily and embarrassing the food at places like Hunan Garden were - if they're going to insist on serving dishes like mu shu pork and sizzling beef that only appeal to small children and sadly unsophisticated palates, then at least do them well. ?But no, that's too much to ask. Fu Lam Mum is actually pretty authentic Cantonese food, which is music to my ears. ?A few of the dishes can be a little greasier than I'd like, like the salty fish fried rice, but at least they serve it at all. ?The wok heat is not the best, but I love that I can order real Chinese food here and not get totally ripped off as I would at Su Hong's. ?

Richard Pro here with another review. Fu Lam Mum is one of the better decorated Chinese restaurants. It's large, bright, and clean. We are well-acquainted with one of the waitresses and enjoy soup on the house when we visit her after 9pm. ? Peking duck here is exceptionally unsatisfying. A very disappointing choice. My father enjoys ordering a beef broth with boiled white radishes, despite the fact that every time we agree to never order it again because it's bland. I typically go for a very flavorful chicken, garlic, and onions served in a Wok at your table. They only messed up on this order twice out of the 20 times I've gotten it over the past 3 years. Food here is fresh and hot. I come here for dinner and dim sum. It's very busy during dim sum and their dishes are flavorful and authentic. Prices are very reasonable and service is quite good. Try to flag down one of the managers. They're both male and dressed in suits. Overall, 4 stars. You can get a very full meal here for a good price and it tastes darn good.

I have come here for dinner once, and for dim sum at least four times. Dinner here was mediocre. The food was pretty good in the way that cheap, greasy Chinese food is usually pretty good. There is no reason to go out of your way to go to dinner here. But the dim sum is great. I love the trolly service, and always look forward to the trollies bearing stacks of brown dumpling cases. I have a fondness for the fried turnip cakes, shrimp dumplings, bao, shrimp rice noodles, green tea balls with sesame, and taro pork puffs, but really, all of the dumplings are great. The plates of meat (usually pork) tend to be dry and flavorless. Avoid the chicken feet and the durian pastries (which stink). I inevitably eat far too much at dim sum here. The selection is slightly limited and the food is slightly less delicious than my South Bay dim sum favorite, Joy Luck Palace (Cupertino), but this place is a close second. I highly recommend coming here for dim sum. I would love to try out their late night (read: post-partying) dim sum service, but meanwhile, I love spending weekend late mornings here. It is pretty noisy and disorganized, though, so as for most dim sum, avoid wearing anything nice.

Recently went here for dinner on a Friday night and while the restaurant was packed, the experience was unusual. While the food was decent, with interesting dishes available, the most memorable part of the dining experience was the "unique" service. The waiters bring out the dishes to your table (that you ordered) and mark things off very much like a dim sum dining experience. AKA the waiters are alway on the perimeter of your table, lean over you to cross off items on the bill, and frequently shout by your ear to communicate with other waiters in the area. I guess this would be fine if you ordered dim sum, but for a reunion dinner with friends, um, not so much.

Just a 'no' to this restaurant. ?My hubby called to make a reservation last week. ?When we arrived, we told the female receptionist that we called and made a reservation at 12:30. ?While she had a hard time trying to understand that simple conversation [don't forget that she actually made the reservation over the phone for us!], she had the lead waiter come over and for no reason, he yelled out loud to the point that every waiting customer could hear him [while we were actually just standing next to him] that they actually do not take reservations?! ?Wow, I mean, really?! ?In that case, did my hubby just talk to a ghost? Food was just okay; not many varieties. ?They seem to open to cater for their loyal customers. ?Would we go back? ?Hm..hell no! ?We will probably head back to Millbrae or Dublin for some serious Chinese food.

Love this place for Dim Sum - give it a 4+/5 for their friendliness adn ability to speak Cantonese, Mandarin and English. Plenty of variety, hot food and busy place - I love to get there about 10.20am on Sunday with friends and spend some quiet time before the hordes of people come in. Dinner, not as good as I thought We had crispy flounder (bland and kinda oily) Salted Fish Fried Ride - very good Braised tofu and greens - very good Chicken with green onions and ginger - pretty tasteless The dinner meal was OK, expensive compared to Kirin Chinese Resaurant (further down on Castro) I think the food is more tasty and less expensive there for dinner Would give FLM 2.5/5 for dinner, but Dimsum 4+/5

one of my family's favorite.. i think we've been coming here for at least 12+ years.. they have good lunch specials.. and if you go after 9pm.. you can order off the lunch specials.. so its definitely a good deal.. so good in fact, sometimes we'll wait to eat dinner after 9 some of my favorite dishes: salt and pepper spareribs, house fried rice, fried fish "filler" (i think it was fillet and someone missed the r..but either way its yum)

Yes, it is SUPER busy, but I can totally understand why - The dimsum is GREAT! ?We went on opening day and we had to wait at least 40minutes for a party of 7, but it was well worth the wait. ?Every dish we got was hot and we all know that cold dimsum is NOT tastey. ?Also, we wanted dessert, but the one we wanted they didn't have. ?When we asked for it, we did not knowing it was the manager we spoke to. ?He came out with a different dessert for us and gave it to us at no charge because they were out of the one we wanted. ?THEN 10minutes later, he tells me they decided to make more, so he brought it over at no charge!!!! We were sooo stuffed we couldn't move for a while, but it was a good feeling because the food was delicious!

The food at the new Fu Lam Mum is overpriced now. I miss their late night lunch specials at their old location. Now their selection of lunch specials at night is weak and more expensive. Boo. Their dim sum is okay, but their service is pretty darn horrible here. Service was better at the old location. Move back!

The dim sum here was pretty good. Typical dim sum, not exceptionall good but not bad at all. Service was better than most dim sum places I go to. The only complaint was that the carts didn't come as frequently as it did to other tables. Maybe this was because we were in the corner of the 2nd floor. Would come here next time if I'm looking for some dim sum and don't feel like driving to San Jose.

GREAT DIM SUM!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not only is the giant restaurant incredibly clean, the service is excellent! Usually you don't get great service at dim sum, but this place is incredible! The servers are quick and always get you want you want (whether it's iced water or more ha gao-totally mispelling that). It's very reasonably priced too. Nothing I ordered tasted too greasy. The Ha Gao (again, apologies for mispelling) is SOOO FREAKING GOOD. I don't really eat anything else when I get Dim Sum; the ones served here are delicious! I've been here for dinner too and their menu is very big, lots of variety and the quality seems to live up with each dish too. Kinda interesting, I noticed that the head hosts speak to their employees in multiple languages!

Don't get me wrong. The dim sum is pretty good here. I went here with my boyfriend and he really wanted bigger portions so we ordered the chicken. ?When they brought it out, it was cold, which we were not expecting. ?Maybe I just haven't had real Chinese food before but it would have been nice to have a warning that it will be cold. ? Then when we told him that we wanted warm chicken and that this is not what we expected, he took the chicken back, warmed it up in the microwave and gave it back to us! ? Needless to say, I was not a happy camper.

Only come here for the ambiance. The dim sum was alright...nothing extraordinary. The same carts came by every few minutes, not much variety, and tasted just ok. However this is the nicest looking dim sum place you will ever see. It is super clean looking, and kinda up scale. Service was better than usual. Probably will not be back for dim sum. It is located in a quaint lil area.

This is a Cantonese Chinese restaurant and is mainly catered for Dim Sum, although thee are dishes you can order too. Their Dim Sum is good, definitely one of the better ones I've had. Their prices are slightly steep and their choices seem somewhat more limited (at least compared to Hong Kong Saigon) but the quality was good. Everything tasted fresh, place is spacious, the ladies pushing carts aren't so pushy or rude. My family also ordered the steamed sea bass which was very good. Maybe slightly undercooked for my taste but I think that's a difference of tastes. I also read that they have Dim Sum til midnight and DS after 9 PM is 3 plates for $10.

A great place to go for dim sum (only served during lunch and after 9 pm). We've also gone for dinner and had some really yummy ox tail in pumpkin (both tasted great) and other dishes. Feel free to ask for stuff off the menu (we ordered Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce which is not on the menu!) More on the traditional side so be mindful that the menu doesn't carry items you'd find at places like Panda Express.

After this place (re)opened, I no longer feel the desire to battle the crowd at the Serramonte Koi Palace, which in itself says a lot about the food. ?The typical dim sums are tasty, though sometimes a bit too greasy with more fried than steamed items. ?However, since I judge a dim sum restaurant by the tastiness of its chicken feet, this place definitely deserves 4 stars. ?The tripe and porridge are both quite tasty also. ?I miss the high-end items, such as shark fin dumplings or swallows nest, but for a neighborhood joint this is a great place. ?Come before 11AM if you want to be seated without waiting.

3 to 3.5 feels accurate. ?kinda pricey cantonese menu, better when you go after 9 PM. ?dim sum offerings are $10 for 3. ?menu is like a daimo. the peking pork ribs standard, seafood chow fun with xo standard. the claypot rice with preserved pork and chinese sausage needed to be better (more crisped rice, sausage too dry) wrapper not that great on the shrimp and chive dumpling so after 9 there is the $8 deal menu also got the salt and pepper shrimp. ?smaller amt but not a bad deal the chicken claypot doesn't come in one. also got the seabass -- prepared japanese style

The seafood hot n sour soup was the best dish we had. Everything else really had no flavor and not that impressive. The space is huge and I really dont see them ever being able to fill up the entire restaurant with guests. It has a banquet feel to it. It is a good place for groups, but the food really wasn't that great. The chopsticks are heavily weighted on the ends ...lol...makes it really hard to eat with them. Glad I tried it, but probably wont go back.

We celebrated my younger bro's bday here. We have pretty much hit up every spot on Castro St. in MV, but haven't tried Fu Lam Mum yet. Overall experience, pretty good! As soon as we walked in, I was taken back by how big the place was and the cool design. We were graciously greeted by the host and seated right away even though our whole party wasn't there yet. We ordered the chow fun, house won ton soup, walnut prawn, flounder, and mongolian beef. All were delicious. Not spectacular, but all up to par. Service was very good too. Our waitperson was very attentive and made no mistakes. They even brought a small complimentary dessert for my bro at the end. The headsets do kinda crack me up though...not sure if the whole secret service look works for an asian restaurant. I haven't had the dim sum yet but we'll probably come back and give it a try despite the ?hit-and-miss reviews. Chalk up another great establishment on Castro St!

I was dying of hunger and I'm not a big fan of Chinese food, but I did eat a bunch that night... and they have many wannabe vegetarian friendly dishes... wasn't super crowded on a Thurs evening and pretty spacious and stuff.

Dim sum served in the evening as well. However, the selections/varieties are limited during the evening. Dim sum was ok. The lotus leaf sticky rice dim sum was good. The food was shiny and alright. Service was ok. The place is two story and big. Everything here was just ok, nothing spectacular. Although, the server that night was pretty nice in offering us to sit back and chit chat as long as we like because it was an hour away from closing time, which is midnight, and there were no other customers coming. He brought us more tea after the bill was paid. That's a really nice gesture but I can't give this place more than 3 stars.

Fu lam is an establishment that is highly overrated both in terms of culinary cuisine and cost. ?For the price that you pay, you'd rather go to Dynasty in Cupertino. ?Chinese people judge dim sum by the shrimp dumplings (har gaw or xia jiao) ... This place doesn't pass! ?Tried using chopsticks to remove them. ?The skin stuck to the tin. ?We could not even pry them off with the fork! ?I gave up and just ate the shrimp filling inside. ?Reminded me of frozen dim sum gone bad! ?The wrapper was just a dry jelly blob. ?Terrible!

tried to have late night dim sum the other night... i eat fish but not other meats.... talked to the server and he told me all the dim sum which were only shrimp; but I got one of them and it reaked of pork, not sure if it was fried in lard or what but it was horrible. ?so basically, I have only had good experiences here when someone chinese orders... Im not chinese.... but it seemed like the waiter understood what I was saying, soooooooo i dunno I did love the fish curry with tofu from the late night menu so I guess I will have to stick with that - if there is a next time - and play it safe. still love the hot tea also.

On the July 4th holiday we stopped by for dim sum lunch. We were lucky to get there in time to get a table. ?The variety wasn't as vast as previous times. ?The quality is average. Nothing spectacular. ?Our party was 3/4 Cantonese, so perhaps that sways this review. However, the atmosphere and decor are in-line with the clientele frequenting downtown MV...this is not your hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant. ?So, at least it's pretty clean everywhere (from seats to tables and the carpeted floor). ?The waitstaff mostly spoke both Mandarin and Cantonese (in addition to English) so that was helpful. ?The tea we asked for was supposed to be gook bo (two type tea with crysanthemum and bo lay flowers) but it was a lot more "bo" than "gook" and was very strong. ?If I have to nitpick about the tea I must've forgotten what there was to eat....because it was forgettable. ?

I'm happy they finally opened a dim sum place here in Mountain View. ?As I always had to go to Saigon Seafood dim sum instead, which has a long wait. ?However, being a new place, I am also giving them some leeway to get their act together. ?For a dim sum place, comparing to other places that serve dim sum, I wasn't happy with the food quality. ?I had the lo bat go, har gow, lo mai gai, and pai gwut. ?Everything had a very bland taste to it, except the pai gwut was pretty good. ?It's like they used a lot less pork fat and salt, as it just didn't taste as good as other dim sum places. ?Plus they charge for tea? ?Tea house is supposed to provide free tea. ?At the same time, I ordered Oolong, and they gave me Jasmine. ?Also, I came alone, and they sat me upstairs at the edge, thus no one ever served me. ?When I did get served, I was getting the leftovers. ?Downstairs appears to get more selection from what I saw. ?Also, the prices for some of the items were decent, like $5 for special and $3 for medium and $2.5 for small. ?The owner appears to own the HK bistro next door, which is a place I like to some extent, but was not satisfied with Fu Lam Mum. ?I'll have to give it a few more tries. ?The good things are that it's not packed, thus no long wait. ?And the place is new and clean. ?Oh, and one last thing, there's no hot cute Chinese hostess at the front!!! Update: I went back here today and ordered the lo bat go, shrimp and pork cheung fun. ?The chueng fun was decent, but small portion. ?lo bat go was not tasty and cold. ?I went here early, so there was plenty of seating and sat downstairs, service was good. ?Not big selection like other dim sum places. ?I still stand by my 2 stars. ?Sorry. ?Hopefully it'll get better.

Overall this place is a 3.5 just like Yelp says. I've been here twice, for dim sum and for dinner. Service is good and it's a clean place. ?So if those factors usually shy you away from Chinese restaurant, this time don't. ?Not everyone speaks English well, so you have to be very patient and take your time in ordering. ?In general, I don't mind that because it takes me out of the states and to the country of the restaurant. ?It's definitely not a problem when the food is good. So, about the food, it's a good dim sum spot. ?It's on the pricey side though. ?So I still prefer Joy Luck dim sum in San Mateo or Cupertino. ?But if you want your dim sum in Mountain view, that's the place to go. As for dinner, I found the menu "huge" and hard to follow. ?They have pictures of dishes that they are not serving and only to decorate the menu! So after you drool looking at one of those pics, you find out they don't serve that dish at all! We ordered: ?Cucumber Special Dish/Appetizer - Basically a Chinese way of pickling cucumbers. ?It's a bit americanized. ?And in this case, I prefer the authentic way of serving it that you can find in Cupertino Village restaurants. ?Clay Pot of Eggplant with Seafood - DELICIOUS! ?I order this one because another yelper posted its picture and it's really as yummy as it looks! ?Fried Rice with Seafood Special Sauce - Really really good too. ?A huge rice dish with seafood in a creamy sauce on top. ?Nice contrast between the fried rice and the creamy sauce. ?Chicken with Cashews - Was just ordinary. Those dishes were for 3 people. ?It was a loooot of food. A few favorite things about this restaurant: ?o It opens late, like until midnight on weekdays! ?o It has dishes with salted fish that I can't wait to try (tofu & fried rice) ?o Lots of chow fun options too. Although 3 stars for me, I'll be back because it's close by, it's clean and if you order the right dishes, you get a delicious meal.

review of dim sum: pro - no line. lots of tables con: nothing that stood out. the BBQ pork buns were brown inside vs. bright pink (but maybe that is a matter of style) the spoons they gave us for our sweet tofu, had yucky specks crusted on it. that I couldn't wipe off easily. mom my complained that she had to ask for all the sauces. they should just give them to us. we ordered BBQ pork buns and it took forever. would not go back here, there are better places to spend my previous calories. though huge space.

I've only been here for Dim Sum, and it was fairly decent. Slightly overpriced which is what you would expect for Castro Street. My only complaint was that at the end of the meal, we were surprised with a large bill and told that certain dim sum items were "chefs special" and $7.50 instead of $3 or $4. There was nothing special about those dishes and it was just 3 little servings or typical dim sum. For double the price, I would expect more food or something new, different, and awesome. Guess not. so I guess the lesson learned is to ask before you order and steer clear of "Chef's Special" unless you want to get ripped off.

Not bad! Came here for dim sum at lunchtime on a weekday. Spacious restaurant with two levels and it wasn't crowded at all. The service was as expected for a dim sum restaurant. Since there weren't that many people and they seated most of the diners towards the center, no one seemed to have any trouble getting what they wanted from the carts (I hate it when you have to flag them down, or they just ignore you altogether). The steam baskets all came out nice and hot and pretty much everything (except for the sticky rice in lotus leaf, which was too mushy and didn't taste fresh) was yummy and tender. The only thing that I noticed was that all of the dim sum items seemed to have a bit TOO much flavor, so not sure if they added more flavor into the food to mask the freshness, particularly of the seafood. They had all of the standard fare, but nothing special here in terms of selection.

Can you believe this? We found a place near Stanford that doesn't close before 10 PM. Hooray!!! And say what? Dim sum late at night? For some reason, having the thought of a late night dim sum puts me in a state of awe. However, I find the experience enjoyable. The food at Fu Lam Mum is tasty but not exceptional. The dim sum ?tastes healthier when compared to other dim sum places I've been to. It's less greasy to be precise. It was good but I find it still mediocre.

For Mountain View, I thought the dim sum was pretty good. ?They could offer a broader variety of dishes, but I guess it's a smaller population that they're catering to. ?It was packed at lunchtime but we managed to get served pretty quick. ?Ordered the standard dim sum which were all good except perhaps the "xiao long bao" which didn't stand up to the Shanghai standard. ?Still, Fu Lam Mum is Cantonese so can't complain. A little pricier than I expected, but I would still go back unless another better dim sum place opens up in downtown Mountain View.

Great Dim Sum! So glad to have a good dim sum joint in MV. I've come here two weekends in a row now, and both times was impressed. We also got a table straight away both times, though we arrived before midday when it seemed to get a little busier. Tried most of the steamed dumplings, and also a few other standard dishes, and all tasted pretty good. I love that they have the shanghai dumplings too, though the second batch we had were lacking in soup. I'll be back again when I next crave dim sum (which won't be long!).

Warning: Review Made By A Guy Who Doesn't Really Like Dim Sum I came here because this is where my boss likes to eat. Can't argue with the boss right? So we sit down and I patiently wait for my food. The experts around me order on my behalf because I don't know what I'm doing. They have some interesting dishes. I'm an adventurous person so I went for it. First Dish: Chicken feet. Covered in sauce. The chicken feet look like chicken feet. You can't mistake it for anything else. It's creepy. But I ate it. It's difficult because of all the small bones. I was told by a hard-core dim sum enthusiast that I should have stayed away from this one. But that was after the fact. Second Dish: Shrimp wrapped in noodle. It's ok. Didn't blow my mind or anything. Third Dish: Duck. Just fried crispy duck skin. This was actually pretty good. Reminds me of Moo Goo Gai Pan. But better. So. While I'm eating, I look around the room and I see a bunch of hot middle aged women eating alone. If you're 30+ and you're looking for a place to pick up women during lunch, I think this is your spot. You only have to put up with gross looking food and the servers who don't speak English. I heard rumors that the little kid from Temple of Doom owns this place. I bet it's a lie though. Some of my information is highly unreliable. "Dr. Jones!! We're out of chicken feet!"

Salted peanuts with seaweed - complimentary Dessert - mango pudding - complimentary Ordered Sizzling rice seafood soup Vegetarian eggrolls Seafood pan fried noodles Pea sprouts Braised tofu with black fungus & veggies Steamed fish Peking duck Overall food was good, but service was really good! Very attentive, friendly, & packed away leftovers for us. ? I would totally come here again to try the dim sum. ?The almond crusted shrimp looked good.

This place has changed a lot ever since my dad sold the restaurant. I remember this place use to fit only about 20 tables, it has definitely expanded and re-decorated itself. If you get here after 9PM, they have reduced price on some of their selections. The portion is fair but the food tastes great. This is Mountain View so I don't expect the food to be cheap. Also, it's a seafood restaurant!

Dying for some dim sum, we packed the kids and drove and drove from San Luis Obispo to this place just so that we could get our fill. ?I know what you're thinking, yeah we're pretty desperate here on the Central Coast. ?It wasn't bad, and was not packed since we got here when the doors were unbolted. ?The conclusion was that it's one of those things that is worth doing whenever we run low on Asian groceries.

The new Fu Lam Mum is located next door to its sister restaurant, Hong Kong Bistro, which specializes in casual, HK-Western fusion food. The old Fu Lam Mum was desperately in need of a face lift, so I was eager to see the results of the renovations. From the scale of the construction project, I had anticipated a very upscale and grand restaurant. And that's exactly what the new Fu Lam Mum delivers. It has a towering main dining room as well as a second floor loft with balcony. The restaurant is also decked out with exhibitionist fish tanks, wine display on the second floor and full bar. All the furniture and china are very contemporary. Even the chopsticks have a little silver at the end to fit into the modern theme. The only furnishings I don't like are the chairs. Despite the nice fabric and stainless steel/brushed nickel frame, they still look like stereotypical Chinese restaurant chairs. I was here for the dim sum. They have the usual steam carts, dessert carts, as well as servers with trays of kitchen specials. We tried the chicken feet, shrimp dumplings, egg custard, pork ribs, porridge, and chang feng. Everything was prepared very well, in fact, as well as any popular dim sum restaurant. I was especially impressed by their egg custard--the tart was the flakiest (most # of layers) I have ever had in NorCal. The prices are also extremely reasonable ($2.50 for S, $3 for M and $4 for L plates). The place will be tough competition for other dim sum restaurants, especially from residents on the South Peninsula, because it delivers identical quality and far superior ambience for equal cost. Fu Lam Mum serves formal banquet style food for dinner. I haven't seen the menu, but since they splurged on a liquor license, I presume they will be serving lots of delicacies and charging accordingly. I will miss the cheap lunch specials at the old Fu Lam Mum, but nothing else. This place is superior in everyway imaginable.

Yes, the restaurant is no longer an 80's-hotel pink with crustacean carcasses hanging ominously from the walls. And yes, they now have fancier, heavier chopsticks and dishes that are all uniform. But I have to agree with Randy F's thorough review, as tonight's dinner turned out to be one of my life's top 20 most disappointing events. This may be affected by the fact that I *loved* the old Fu Lam Mum. When I say *loved,* I mean, last year I almost made my boyfriend move to Mountain View (where the rent is 10% higher than where we are now), just so I could be within walking distance of that lovely pink eyesore. God, I miss that place. The new place looks posh; I'll give them that. And the food is presented better now (whatever that means, since it doesn't taste like it belongs on those fancy plates... cheap, authentic food. Isn't that what Fu Lam Mum used to be about?). But what really had me vowing never to come back was the service. On a quiet Tuesday evening (not even half the 1st floor was full), the service was "Asian" (don't act like you don't know what that means; all us Asians begrudgingly know what that means) to the point of being outright dismissive. When I asked the server if I could order the "deep fried fish... the one with the soy sauce and green onion garnish," (that's the way I used to order this dish), he told me it was called "salt and pepper fish" now....and of course, when it came, it was a completely different dish. A completely different and disappointing dish. It also seems like the "we all serve every table" ethos doesn't work here quite as well as it did in the smaller restaurant. After taking our order, that same waiter was nowhere to be seen, and it took us four attempts at making eye contact with a passing waiter before we were acknowledged and brought a glass of water for one of my dinner companions. I just don't think I could handle the disappointment again. I am not coming back for another year, during which time I will go to Queen House when in Mountain View and hope that at least that one waiter disappears because he made 1/4 of my dinner SUCK.

I've been here only once. ?Glad to know that there's a chinese restaurant not in SF that opens till midnight. ?Prices are a bit on the higher side but the food quality is worth it. ?We ordered a couple of clay pots, one being a cod filet clay pot. ?I specifically asked if the filets they are using were ?really rock cod after I ordered. ?The waiter checked with the kitchen and came back saying no. ?He suggested a seafood clay pot instead. ?I was impressed with two things: 1) he was honest and 2) they replaced my order with the seafood clay pot which turned out to be awsome, and he didn't charge me the higher price. ?We also ordered the mongolian beef and they were all perfectly cooked and were very tasty. ?I can't wait to try their late night menu and dim sum.

My bf and I used to go here when it was at the old location(it was our first and many more date). We recently went to check out the new spot and I thought it was very drafty but nice. They used to have this rice dish, twice fried rice with chicken and abalone, and I had been told that they didnt't have it so i was pretty disappointed. But we went ahead and got some dim sum, which was decent, not steller. The reason I'm giving it a fourth star is, besides being open til midnite, because upon leaving I was told that they made a rice plate similar, Fu Kin rice (yes, I laughed to myself). Four days later, I got it. I LOVE IT. So it's fried rice and separately they give you a chicken-seafood thick sauce to put over it. It sounds strange but it's soooo goood. try it.

This place prices like an expensive Cantonese / Hong-Kong style restaurant but the food is more like an amateur wannabe. ?I have eaten at expensive Cantonese restaurants all around the world and let me assure you that the calibre of food at this restaurant does not even come close. My friends and I were here for dinner, and we ordered the panfried seafood noodles, the special of the day - "shrimp two-ways", and sweet and sour pork. ?The panfried seafood noodles were ok, although a little bland. ?The sweet and sour pork was over-cooked and dry. ?It was almost like the pork had been sitting in the freezer so long it had freezer burn. The worst was the shrimp two-ways. ?How is a plate of deepfried shrimp with two different colored mayo sauces "shrimp two-ways"? ?I was expecting perhaps steamed shrimp and fried shrimp, or panfried shrimp or SOMETHING. ?In high end Cantonese restaurants, they have a way of butterflying the shrimp so that it resembles a shrimp ball when it's cooked. ?Know what I mean? ?Not so here. ?

Decent dim sum in a convenient location - a bit pricier than the alternatives further south. ?A good proportion of the diners appear to be Chinese, so the food must be reasonably good or authentic. Many of the cart ladies speak some English, which always rubs me the wrong way - when ordering Chinese food, I prefer the mystery of mutually unintelligible communication. A deep fried fish dish showed up cold. ?Bad. ?We were able to return it, speaking only English. ?Good. Ask for a little plate of spicy mustard.

I've been to this place many times, and I'd have to say that their food is good, but not spectacular. ?I usually come for dinner, and I have come once for a large celebration that used up the whole restaurant, but not for dim sum, so I can't comment on that. It seems to me this place is on the more expensive side for Chinese food, but I guess that's to be expected since it's on Castro Street. ?The decor is average for a Chinese restaurant, but the place is rather large and it has a second story with even more seating. ?The place is generally busy and since it's on Castro, the parking is pretty horrendous during meal times because you're parking in the general parking shared by everyone. The food is good, but for the price I guess I expect something with a little more 'umph,' and I don't feel like I get that here. ?The service is pretty average for your typical Chinese place, so in the grand scheme of things, I think that for the price and location you pay for, it could be a little better. ?While we haven't ever been totally ignored, it's not like they will refill your water, so they're not extremely attentive or overly friendly. The portions are a pretty good size, and while I won't list out individual dishes since everyone has different tastes, I found that some of their beef dishes were pretty tasty, and I've tried this fried milk thing that is very unique. ?However, while I used to think BBQ pork was BBQ pork everywhere, apparently it is not. ?The BBQ pork here looks and tastes a little atypical to me, as if it's not totally on the fresh side, but since the little nephews love it, that's why it's ordered every time. Unfortunately in this area a good Chinese restaurant is a little hard to come by. ?It is hard to get just the right the combination of price, taste, decor, and service. ?This is probably a place you would take some out of town relatives to for Chinese food out of convenience and because it looks a little more upscale than one of the smaller establishments, but I don't think it would necessarily measure up to a place you'd have, say, a wedding banquet at. ?If it were up to me, I don't know if I'd keep frequenting this place, but my in-laws love it, so I guess that's where I'll continue to go.

We left hungry. ?All we saw was the same steam cart of dim sums over and over and over again. ?It appeared possible to order food but with no menu on the table and no way to get the attention of the staff, we ate the usual suspects of the sui mai variety and left. ?The receptionist was sarcastic, and the wait staff was unavailable. ?Overall the service staff acted like they had been sentenced to community service. ?It's nice having dim sum on Castro, but for now, walk on by. ?Hopefully they will eventually get their act together.

I rarely give such a low review, especially considering the food here is very good. Upon entering, one immediately recognizes how unprecedented this huge restaurant is in downtown Mountain View. The decor is a disparate mix of stylish, and tacky. ?The menu is quite large and they offer an excellent selection of Chinese dishes not easily found in most American restaurants. The food was excellent, the service was not. We were seated right away, and given menus. Our order was taken quite a bit later, and we waited a very long time for our food. We were presented with soup bowls first, soup followed about 10 minutes later, and after finishing soup, we had to ask for water, and our drink orders again. After quite some time, three other servers began to bring us our food in a very disorganized manner. They did not know what we had received ?already, and what we had ordered. about 40 minutes into our meal, we asked that our rice be served, which it was, stone cold and hardened. It was then I realized that my water glass was very obviously not clean, and had food particles in the bottom. ?Our Mushu pancakes were so hard we could barely peel them off the plate on which they were served, and when we did, we could not unfold them, or roll them up. The meal really was a wash. Bad service, and serious cleanliness issues insured that I will not go back, and I will caution others against it as well.

Pretty much my go-to place for Chinese food when I get a hankering for it. ?Doesn't hurt that this place is one of the only in the area that has nice atmosphere as well as good food. ? I think I have had almost everything on the menu by now. At dinner time, the deep fried whole fish is a standard and its awesome. ?If you get it, make sure that you eat it fast (like in 3 minutes) to ensure maxiumum crunchiness. ? The after 9pm menu is also great if you're late eater.. there's a long list of dishes that are 8 bucks. ?Can't beat that. ? Recently tried Fu Lam for dim sum and its good as well. ?When I dont want to drive down to Cupertino, its a good standby. ? Ben, the owner, is great and super friendly. ?After coming here a bunch of times, he got to know us and always stops by to chat and say hi.

For dim sum. It's ok. It's a quick fix if you don't want to go to San Jose. The fried donuts inside of rice wrapping noodles were great but the other dishes were ok. Apparently they have Shanghi bun which we wanted to try but couldn't due to slow service. All in all ok. Service slow. More expensive. I'd give it 2.5 stars but they don't have that. And 2 is for like burger king in my opinion. Good when ure really hungry but otherwise not what you'd eat.

If you want to eat in clean restaurant, you can go upstairs in San Fran or drive to Fu Lam Mum. Fu Lam Mum is clean restaurant. They have bar in plain sight, but never ask if you want drink.

We got _really_ bad experience here on Chinese New Years. I won't talk about the wait to be seated. That's just expected. But the wait for food, an hour and a half. Then 2 of the dishes had been sitting around for a half hour, at least, in the kitchen, and was in really bad shape. Another was extremely over-cooked and also difficult to eat. I give them 3 stars, instead of 1, because, frankly, we should haven't expected it on Chinese New Years. With the heavy business they'd be doing. But still, don't seat more people than you have the staff for. That's just common sense for any restaurant.

I went to this place after reading the reviews on Yelp. ?It was just ok. ?I grew up in Monterey Park so I'm a bit biased when it comes to good authentic Chinese food. ?I think I ordered the wrong items because everything was so heavy and greasy. ?I got home and had the worst stomach ache ever. ?I probably won't go back for awhile. ?We had the following items: Peking Duck - mediocre, I've had better. The duck was bland but the little "mahn-tos" were good. Fried Prawns - Gross and greasy Salt and Pepper "Squids" - Heavy, greasey and not that "salt and peppery." Bok Choy with Garlic sauce - Very tasty, but its hard to go wrong with bok choy. I agree with everyone else in that the prices are decent and the food is pretty authentic.

On 4th of July, before we went to see the symphony and firework show at the Shoreline, we stopped by this newly opened restaurant for dinner. ?It's a new building and the structure looks grand and airy. ?The talbes and chairs were middle of the road feel. ?We order fresh cod stir fry with green peas and the head and bone as soup with tofu. ?In addtion, we have beef and scrispe chicken. ?For five of us male, we did under order our food and ended up didn't have enough. ?Due to timing, we just let it go. ?The food is good and not greasy as many typical Chinese jaunts. ?The prices were reasonable but I can find better value at Kirun Restaurant a couple of blocks away with a little less atmosphere. ?These are Cantonese style with little to no spicy item as compared to norther China region.

fu lam mum's one-small-shrimp-har gow was one of the worst that ive ever tasted..the skin was thick, goo-ey and tasted like starch..the shrimp was also small and not that fresh. this was a huge difference to HK saigon's tasty har gow that was packed with fresh prawns.. i love har gow, thats why i was really disappointed with fu lam mum. we were sitting on the second floor of the restaurant. ?we were there for one hour and could only have 3 dishes. we were waiting for the cart to come but the wait was way too long. we were quite hungry and decided to order the dishes that we wanted with the waiter..but again the order never came.. so we decided to leave i cant wait to go back to hong kong saigon restaurant this weekend. don't waste your time waiting for dim sum at fu lam mum.

The food is good, the prices are fair, the service is typical. ?I usually eat there on the weekdays and the place is busy, but doesn't feel crowded because they have lots of space. ?Some of the other dim sum places are too hectic for me, but this place has the right atmosphere.

I have been to Fu Lam Mum several times and I like it. ?The dim sum served is different from the kind that you typically get a other places is that it is not greasy. ? The food tastes lighter (I guess some folks equate that with bland). The same style of ?lighter-tasting food extends to the entrees as well. The staff can be unresponsive at times, folks can sometimes wait a long time after seating for a waiter to come by to get their order. ?Great venue, open and clean.

This restaurant is fairly new. I liked the interior space because it was spacious and clean. The menu was typical. I enjoyed the Peking duck and lettuce wraps. I didn't have any seafood or dim sum.

Used to come here about 15-20 years back and then it was fairly priced with good solid Cantonese-style seafood, and a late-night porridge and noodle soup menu. That was when it was in cheaper digs across the street. ? Back then I would have given them 3.5-4 stars. Recently, I returned with my parents and my own wife and kids for dim sum. Man, what a disappointment! First of all, the new location on the south side of Castro is nice, clean, airy and spacious. On the upper end of the scale in this area. Didn't check into it, but I suspect they had dinner banquets in mind for the new place. Price notwithstanding, I rate the dim sum 3 stars. Very average fare - even in the dim sum-challenged South Bay. I don't think these guys would survive a month in SF or Oakland. My acid test - har gow and sui mai - landed them a solid "meh". ?Oversteamed and a bit bland by my tastes. ?Honestly, most of the take out dim sum joints on Clement St (SF) are way better than this place. What I do give them credit for are creativity and selection. They do have some varieties that aren't seen in many dim sum restaurants. Unfortunately many of these unusual dishes are fried or types of "goh" (cake), which I shy away from for dim sum. Taking price into consideration, Fu Lam Mum is way overpriced. The cheapest dishes were $3.50-4 per plate. Many were $6-7. For example, we like to order some gai lon (Chinese broccoli) to give us the illusion of eating healthy, Kind of like ordering a side salad to go with your supersized Double Whopper and fries. They charged us something like $7.50 for a tiny serving - maybe 6 or 7 stalks in all. My company would kill for their margins! Service was also 2-star at best. Although dim sum brings its own challenges in the realm of service, I thought they were below average here. Flagging down a waiter to bring us ice water was harder than hailing a cab in Manhattan at rush hour. Trying to pay was another mystery. 5 min. to get someone to come over to tell them we wanted the check. 10 min for the check to arrive. Another 5 min to get them to take my credit card. Another 10 min to actually get my credit card back and finish up the bill. You get the picture. Anyways, I am not big on Fu Lam Mum as you can tell. Of course, this is just one visit for dim sum, so my thoughts here don't extend to their normal menu or late-night service.

I have a hard time understanding how this place is always packed on the weekends. ?I have been here several times for both dim sum and dinner. ?The dim sum served here is just ok and their prices are poor. ?Sometimes the dim sum that comes out is lukewarm, which is a definite no-no. ?Portions for the food ordered from the kitchen are small (both at lunch and dinner) and overpriced when compared to competitors. ?This place gets 2.5 stars in my book, but I'm rounding down to 2 as after multiple visits I still leave hungry and unimpressed.

Do not go there unless you want to eat food with absolutely *no* taste ! We stopped by this place in the evening by mistake. My wife wanted Dim-sum. But we realized that Dim-sum are only for lunch time. Too late... we were placed at a table. Fine after all... why not try. We simply wasted $60 for some food that simply had no taste. Even our son who is 13 month didn't want to eat the (burned) frid rice... ah ah ah. what a Joke. The soup was made of water and boiled fish/noddles. Water tasted water... at least; the green veggies weren't properly cooked and I still remember I had to chew like a cow few times... Fried noddles were... say... bad either. No more surprise. The waitress saw how disappointed we were. They tried to get back to catastrophe by complimenting how my wife is so beautiful (which I agree but I felt like it was marketing, here... ;-P ); Then the boss stopped by... yeah. Nice try but too late. But at least we told them that something was missing in the cooking... Finally they offered us a free (tasteless :-) orange flan that at least our son could eat. Yeah! The fact you can find soo better for more than half the price (I'll write reviews about the other good places) drove me a bit upset. One may argue that maybe this kind of food is not my taste... which I would answer that it's not true : I love "Joy Luck Palace" in Cupertino, for example. This Fu Lam Mum is a joke , compared to Joy Luck. It seems like the success of having found a trendy street in Mountainview made them think they could avoid cooking decently. Just don't go there. It may be the worst restaurant from the whole street...

Fu Lam Mum catered dim sums to our wedding cocktail hour, ?since we wanted a few Chinese dim sum to add to our other hors d'oeuvres. ?They didn't dissapoint us, ?all of our guests loved it and they were happy to have shrimp dumplings and sesame balls to munch on among other western styled hors d'oeuvres. ?They were not only tasty, also made the cocktail hour more interesting. ?

The foods and hours here are great but the services is terrible even when it is empty. Its not cheap but its not a rip off. Its like a par food when you want to eat something random like Dim Sum on a cold night with your girlfriends. Its 3 types of Dim Sum for $10 but the service is so bad it might take you three hours to have dinner. 30 minutes for tea, frustrated a little after other 20 minutes to get up and get your own menu, then you have to flag a person down and then you get food every 15-20 minutes. Then it takes them ten minutes to get the check and if you are lucky and the guy running the register is actually there to ring you out. If you like it slow pace like a turtle this is the place for you. The fried taro and sesame balls are delish and the other dim sum is typical shrimp with chives or nothing or pork or fried or you know anything you can put in a wrapper. I wanted to try other stuff but they took so long I didn't want to be there until Christmas. Patience is a virtue so have a snack before coming here because the food is good not sure it is worth the wait.

Went with my family for weekend lunch around 1:30 PM. ?The restaurant was quite full then. ?The food was excellent. ? I asked for "no MSG". ?The waiter said that he'll tell the cook, but some sauces already have MSG in it. ? When it was time to serve the "hot and sour soup" ?the waiter asked if I wanted it, because it was "heavily with MSG". ?His quote.. ? Good authentic Chinese food, just don't go to the rest-room.

IMPORTANT NOTE: ?Kitchen closes at 11:45 PM! We give Fu Lam Mum 3.5 stars -- got to ?at 11:30 PM on Saturday. ?The waitress was somewhat short with us, letting us know that the kitchen would be closing in 10 minutes. ?She didn't give us the lunch specials menu until we asked for it. Basically, we wish the service had been less brusque and friendlier. When it came to ordering, they were all out of chow fun, and we didn't have long enough to browse the lunch specials to really decide on other things. ?We ended up getting the hot and sour soup (mild -- needed both the white pepper and the vinegar found on the table), two orders of pot stickers (very good), and had to have made special an entree order of beef with black bean sauce (recommended by another yelper) along with steamed rice. Being the only non-Asians in the place, the waitress delivered forks to our table without our asking (a bit odd, since we use chopsticks), and she didn't seem to remember the glasses of water I'd requested early on. ?Finally I had to head toward the kitchen and get her attention to get my glass of water. I'm sure we missed out on some good stuff on the various Chinese-only signs around the place and on the Chinese menu. ?That said, the food was good -- and darned good for that hour of the evening. In any case, we need to let folks know that they stop cooking altogether at 11:45, so slowpokes like us get there in time to order. ? One gentleman showed up around midnight and was turned away. ?Our meal came to about $35 for the two of us -- could have been cheaper if we'd gotten a lunch special for one of us instead of the entree (for 8.75 plus whatever they charged for the rice for two people.) ?We'll try that the next time we return in the wee hours. Thank you to all you yelpers whose reviews helped us find this place.

I remember going to Fu Lam Mum before it relocated to that fancy new location, and it is just as great now as it was before. However, what I will complain about is how much the prices have gone up since then. They are missing some of my personal favorites like this abalone and sauce over rice dish. We mistakenly ordered the Abalone Sauce and Lobster Over Rice dish, and it didn't really meat our expectations. I would recommend Fu Lam Mum for a nice Chinese style dinner with your family!

I came for a late night meal and it was average - the place was a quarter full and we waited ages for our bill and change. ?3 stars. The bf and I dropped by for lunch dim sum and again, average. I'd go to other dim sum places before I came here. ? The wait staff managed to walk around and around and never make eye contact unless they were standing over your shoulder with a tray of dim sum hovering over your head. ?Dropped to 2.5 stars. I went for their regular lunch specials with 3 friends and it was horrible. ?Dropped to 1 star. ?They opted for dim sum and I ordered the sesame shrimp off the lunch menu. ?My sweet and sour soup came while my friends got their first round of dim sum. ?My friends were on their second round of dim sum when I asked where my order was. ?Three wait staff started snapping at one another and I was told "Sorry, your order is coming out soon." ?Another 10 minutes later, it came out. ?Bright, batter wrapped, atomic orange sauce soaked shrimp with a few pieces of broccoli and no sesame. ?I thought I had the wrong dish and asked. ?They laughed and told me they forgot the sesame and were going to take my dish back. ?My friends had finished their final round of dim sum at this point so I just told them to pack it up to go. ?I peeked inside the to-go box and found no sesame, just glowing shrimp with impossibly thick layers of fried batter soaked in orange goo. ?My friends stared at it and held said the dish smelled acidic. ?I'd give zero stars if I could.

By far the worst dim sum I have ever had in the bay area, definitely pales in comparison to Hong Kong Flower Lounge, Joy Luck Place or Fook Yuen! Their tea is so diluted that it feels like you are drinking yellowish water! The only advantage is you do not have to wait as long to get seated as at other dim sum restaurants...I guess it should be pretty clear why!

This place sucks. I went here for Dim Sum on a Sunday shortly after they opened. There was hardly any service (although it was shortly after they opened, and they were fairly busy) and the food was nothing special to warrant the extra miles from Cupertino to downtown Mountain View. We have also been there for dinner (near Mother's Day), and that was a sad experience. Our large group (two big round tables) was seated upstairs near the mini-kitchen. The service was again slow and sporadic (the restaurant was not so busy on this evening), and the dishes came out cold. Because everyone was paying their share, for about 20 people at $20 each, the bill came to around.. well, you can do the math. This was for 16 dishes (8 per table). After the dinner fiassco, we have not been back.

Overall, I think their dinner and better than lunch. If you go after 9pm, they have specials. ?Dim Sum is $10/3 dishes (selected items) and it's still a good deal. ?Atomsphere is excellent and it's clean. ?Waiters/waitresses all speak English, so it makes easy to order without the need of knowing any Chinese. Dim Sum is OK and it's on the pricy side. ?Services is always great. This place opened even during holidays. ?They definitely work very hard by opening long hours and during holidays.

I came here on a weekend with the family, craving some delicious Dim Sum. The place was packed with people and it is pretty huge so I was expecting something outstanding...needless to say, I was disappointed. The Dim Sum was eh. The Shrimp Dumplings would fall out of their casing, which has rarely happened to me before and the Chow Fun was completely bland. I was not impressed with their food at all, except I will say that their Crispy Shrimp Balls were delicious. Service was okay but it could have been better. I had to wait for 5-10 minutes before a waiter notice me flagging them down for a glass of water. I've had my share of good Chinese food and amazing Dim Sum as well. I am always going up to Chinatown in San Francisco and finding new places that amaze me and I hoped to find the same here in Mountain View since its so close by, but it was a disappointment.

recent update (062108) since my original review (121706, which was originally 5 stars): i am now giving Fu Lam Mum 3 stars: Fu Lam Mum has recently moved down one block across the street on Castro in a swankier, larger space. ?the ambience is much more upscale compared to its previous modest look. ?i think they are catering to the more affluent single thirty-something crowd. ?the prices reflect that as well. ?i am not a fan of their new look-- i much prefer their older, more modest and humble atmosphere. i brought a large group (family and friends totaling nine) for dinner one night. ?we ordered things on the menu i've not tried before in my many experiences at Fu lam Mum, and i thought they were pretty good. ?the same stuff we've ordered before were still really good. ?compared with the prices from their previous location, the current menu is marked up greater than 33%. ?however, i am not sure that the food is worth the extra money. these factors combined (atmosphere, food, cost) will deter me from coming to Fu Lam Mum again. ?there are better options out there for a good chinese meal. i can only remember some of our dishes and we ordered nine in total: deep fried oysters -- double order--yum! salt and pepper prawns (peeled and butterflied!?!? ?what the heck?!?!) fried founder in a spicy sauce (that was good) half of a chicken, served with a green onion/ginger dipping sauce (a bit dry, actually) tender greens (hard to mess up) clams in black bean sauce (always a good one to order) ~~~~~~~~~~~ i first heard about this place through a friend. ?he went with a small group of his friends, and they didn't find the food there to be particularly special. ?then again, none of them were cantonese, and i got the impression that they didn't order anything outside of what they know as the general menu of chinese take-out food. ?seeing that seafood was a popular theme on their menu (my favorite), ?i decided to try it. to date, i've been there dozens of times, and every time i walk away with a full and happy belly without a dent in my wallet (~ $37 including tip for two, and we eat A LOT). ?i usually go after 8:30 pm on weekdays or nights, and the place is usually full of chinese people (my BF is oftentimes the token non-asian). ?the wait service is friendly and efficient, and particularly friendly if you order in mandarin or cantonese. ? ? one of my favorites is the Salty Chicken, which is served as one half of a whole chicken (i never use their dipping sauce), sliced into manageable pieces. ?consistently very tender and juicy. ?the Clams with black bean sauce is fantastic-- one of their best dishes, i think. ?the sauce is not too heavy, but maintains good balance between the clams and the sauce. ?their Sauteed squid with salt and pepper (you might know this as "spicy salt-baked squid" from other restaurants) is pretty good, though i still think Hunan Homes make it the absolute best. ?a few times i had a hankering for fried oysters, and though i only saw steamed oysters on the menu, i asked them to fry them up anyway, and out came a platter with at least six big juicy fried oysters (only $8.50!)! ?my favorite soup is the Hot and Sour, which is chock full of sliced bean curd, mushrooms, etc. ?its not as good at Fresh Taste (Palo Alto) but i still love it. ?oh, and you can always ask them what sorts of veggies they have (that might not be on the menu) and choose whatever you want from what they have on hand. ?my favorite is bok choy with garlic, and on choy (they will even make this with shrimp sauce or fermented tofu). ? ? i can't wait to take my parents to eat here when they come visit-- they will feel right at home, and maybe they can read the daily specials (written in chinese) to me too.

This isn't the best Chinese restaurant I've eaten at, but it's the most consistent. This is my family's go-to restaurant for birthday and holiday celebrations, and for the random get together. We ate here a couple of nights ago, and were immediately seated. We go here so often, and my brother knows the owner, so they pretty much knew what we were about to order. We got the $108 family meal with some minor dish changes. The bill came out to be $170 (with tip), which is really good considering the same meal would have been much more at other places. The service has always been really good. They're really attentive and accommodating. I always feel at home here because my family is trilingual and so is most of the staff. And the location is great!

Absolutely fantastic! I will never bother going all the way up to Chinatown now that I know of this great local place ... and it is not too pricey, either. My family and I picked random things from the menu, and were very happy with each. My favorite was the beef clay pot (that's not the exact name of the dish), which was a lot like pot au feu, but with a bit less veggies. The service was good, but it took a while for us to get to pay.

If you visit this restaurant, I'd highly suggest takeout versus dining at the restaurant. The service (or lack thereof) completely ruins the entire eating experience. The food was good but don't pay attention to the staff's recommendations in terms of how much to order - they try to get you to order more to increase the size of your bill (has happened all 3 times we've ordered from them). Bottom line: the food was good. The service was awful.

Fu Lam Mum has decent Cantonese cuisine located in the heart of Mountain View. Parking can be a little challenging on Castro St. but if you can find parking, you should try this restaurant. They have good dishes at average prices. Their menu offers a wide selection to suit all tastes; seafood, beef, chicken, pork, and vegetarian. I went there once with an Indian friend of mine, and because of his special dietary requirements, the restaurant cooked him a special soup (free!) so he could enjoy the meal with the rest of us. The service is attentive, and it definitely helps if you know the manager that runs the place. I like to order their Peking Duck, which is on their "daily special" menu. The used to have set dinner specials everyday but they have since eliminated that so we could order any specials on any evening. I also have to give props to the popularity of this restaurant because I bumped into a friend that I have lost contact for over 12 years one evening when I came here to eat. We have both moved away from the Bay Area after living here for a while, but it was fate which brought us back to the same restaurant again after so many years. So not only can you enjoy great food at Fu Lam Mum, you may also bump into a old friend who you have lost contact with!

My friends and I went here for dinner and we ordered the family dinner for 4. That included a bean curd dish, stir fried beef, peking duck, honey walnut shrimp, some duck meat soup and dessert. I was actually pretty disappointed in the food. The food was average, but pretty bland. Soy sauce, white pepper and hot chili oil was a staple for every dish. However, the service was pretty fast.

Stopped by to check out the new restaurant on Castro. ?Didn't know if was dim sum, but was very happy it was as I've been craving it! The ambiance is great for a chinese restaurant - - as modern as a chinese restaurant gets. ?The food was delicious, the only thing is that the serving sizes were very small. ?ie. the sticky rice with chicken is usually much bigger at other dim sum places. ?But the quality of food was definitely great! ?We had the steamed pork buns (yummy, though a bit sweeter than usual), preserved eggs porridge (yummy), vegetarian rice noodle roll (a bit cold), sticky rice with chicken (delicious), pork spareribs (tasty), egg custard (good), and the mango pudding (yummy). ?The service was pretty good. ?Apparently, a lot of the wait staff already remembered us from the "hong kong bistro" next door.- - same owner. ?I'm very happy they opened up so close to home ;-) ?Lunch for 2 adults and a 1 year old .. $35. ?Based on food quality itself I'd give it 5 stars but because the portions are small and a bit pricey I'll give it 4 stars.

we come here for most of our family dinners and the food is always pretty good (we rotate between kirin, hk restaurant and here) one of the few local chinese restaurants that haven't been completely americanized. we've come here for lunch and dinner, but i'd like to try their late night sometime. on the customer service front, this is one restaurant that definitely has its biases for asian/chinese customers. examples: 1) my dad and i came here with some family friends (who were not chinese) one of the dishes we ordered was brought out with sweet and sour sauce, and as one of the waitresses were about to put down the "chinese" sauces she was told not to because "they don't know how to eat it" (rough translation) when i responded in chinese that we *DID* want it, the waitress was like "ah! you know how to eat it it!" (kind of surprisingly but also approvingly) 2) they bring out different desserts to chinese tables and non-chinese tables. ?usually the chinese tables will get their red bean/tapioca/etc type dishes while the rest of the tables will get something a bit more generic like mango pudding or something like that. ?not necessarily a "bad" thing, but just some observations i've made in the past.

The food is exotic with interesting meat/seafood dishes. I had soft shell crab with egg yolk and it was fantastic. I wanted a second piece but me greedy companions took it all!!! Everyone liked the food here and the owner came over to chat. Good service, friendly management, and good food what's not to like. The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of five is that everything is family style (meaning you have to go with a big group) so no date night here.

There are only a handful of places still open after 9pm in the Valley. ?I mean, only a handful of places that makes good food. ?Sucky is easy. Good is hard. ?And at the Fu, it's pretty damn good. ?They whip out their evening menu after 9pm and they close at 11pm. ?And I'm telling ya, it perhaps the best damn Cantonese cuisine in the entire Bay Area. ?It's that good. ?Sure Golden Island in Milpitas is good too, but they're not open late. ?And Oakland's Peony is too far away. ?But this place will give the others a run for their money. ?I always get the crispy chicken. ?The skin is perfectly crispy and there's no fat under the skin. ?I don't know how they do it except they do it better than anyone else. ?Go during the weekdays when it's not so crazy. ?You'll get a bowl of complementary brothy soup or hot and sour (the.best.ever). ? And enjoy. ?As for service and cleanliness, this place is one of the best in the area (in a Chinese restaurant even!). ?The Queen House across the street has good noodle soup, but that's it (their menu is limited to a lot of dishes with exactly the same sauce and, ?aesthetically, it's a dive!).

This place should be renamed to Eww Lazy Dumb. We ordered an appetizer and two entrees. They brought out the appetizer and it was just meh, but tolerable. Then they bring out one entree for us to share, which was fine because that's what we intended to do anyway. The dish was extremely greasy and dripping oils and started a revolution in my stomach shortly after the dinner. Though our main complaint was that the waiters completely forgot about the second entree. Hey, stuff happens, but when FIVE different waiters come up to you one after another and attempt to take away your plates and utensils and give you the check, that's a problem. When we explained that we are still waiting on our second entree for the 5th time, one of the managers is like "Ok, so do you want us to take it off the check or take it to-go?" Ummmm, what part of "We are waiting on our second entree, so please don't take away our plates" wasn't clear? And why do we have to choose between taking it off the order or getting it to go? The restaurant was definitely not closing yet. Also, why did they assume that we were not going to order dessert? We actually were going to initially, but certainly not after service like that. What a disappointment.

Not impressed at all, we walked by this place & every time it was pretty packed, plus the name of the restaurant is the same as one of the best in HK, we thought we would give it a try. Now I know there are no relations b/t the two, for sure!!!! they serve traditional Cantonese cuisine, which specializes in seafood, BBQ & family style rice & noodle dishes, we were so disappointed at how horrible their soy sauce chicken tasted, I took one bite & gave up, this is a very basic dish to Chinese BBQ, the New Saigon have a much better version, and the beef chow fun was tasteless, we ordered a clay pot dish of minced beef w/ vermicelli, the flavor was fine but it had a burnt taste to it, someone must have forgotten to take it off the stove. I would've given this place just 1 star had not for the oyster dish that we ordered, fried oyster coated in salted duck egg yolk, an original dish not found elsewhere & it was flavorful & spot on. But I wouldn't go back there for just 1 dish, we didn't bother taking any of the leftover home.

"The dim sum there is AWESOME" were the words of my co-worker who swore up and down that the dim sum was great. ?Now, I've had my fair share of dim sum and I think I know what's a good dim sum and what's not (been eating dim sum since I was very very little). ?I'd say the food was just OK. ?The service was horrible - but you know what, I don't think i've gone to a dim sum place that had good service. ?People are rude and impatient. ?Drinks were literally slammed on my table and splashed onto the table cloth without a word of apology. ?I hated it when I get seated close to the kitchen where I can see all the dirty dishes pile up and where all the carts come out from but for some reason never come close to our table. ?Dim sum, dim sum... I love thee but I don't think your people loves me.... how I wish that I would one day find a dim sum place that has decent service where people would actually say words like "welcome, thank you, I'm sorry, I'll be right with you, how can i help you, what would you like, is there anything else I can get you, how is your food, please come back soon, ..." ?Wishful thinking? ?I think so...

this place is an excellent restaurant to experience dim sum the way it's supposed to be experienced. they push around the carts (why do restaurants skip carts these days?) and the restaurant is very clean and spacious, unlike most chinese restaurants. the service was exceptional, and it wasn't too crowded, though we arrived at 11am on saturday morning. the food is pretty tasty, and they had a good amount of variety. the price is decent, for four adults and one child, the total bill was $50. i would definitely come back here again.

Update: ?This restaurant moved from a run-down, hole-in-wall place with gunk covered green-sided ?walls a few blocks down to this MARVELOUS upscale tiled floor with stainless steel and glass rails. ?What a transformation! ? MAN...looked like the owner robbed a bank or something! ?With many anticipation, it just opened on April 26 to an UPSCALE authentic chinese restaurant . As my co-workers and I walked in, I noticed most tables were having dim sum! ?I never recalled there were dim sum at the old place. ?The place is HUGE and clean. ?The servers were all dress up, but with hand written name tags (probably still on order!) ?The chairs, tables, chopsticks, dishes....EVERYTHING was new. ?The owner spared no expense! ?The chopsticks are a lot different than what I'm used to. ?They have metal plated at the end which made them a lot heavier at one end. ?Since everything new, I hope they also improved the kitchen food. ?The menus are solid, but noticed the prices for lunch special are a little more expensive than before ($8). ?We were told if we're having the lunch special ...no tea charge as compared to if we're only having dim sum! As the plates arrived, WOW....very decorative! ?Clam-shaped white dishes! Mongolian Beef - It's nice and spicy. ?Meat was tender in the middle (tasted like they fried it a little) Fish with Spicy Sauce - Fish was VERY flavorful. ?It has a "Smoked" taste to it. ?The dish was served with fried tofu. Ma Po Tofu - ?It was good, but without the minced pork like a lot of places do. ? The food was good...but a litle disappointed at the portion...because I was DAMM hungry. ?I worked late the previous night and had only a cuponoodle. Overall, the food was great....will be coming back, but not when I'm REALLY hungry! **************************************************?************************ This is probably my 3rd time at this place. ?The food is great and geniune, but this time..it's lacking service. ?It took over 30 minutes for the kitchen to cook a simple (Curry beef over rice)! ?The curry sauce is not too spicy, just right with nice texture. ?Previous visit did take this long. 4 Stars for food 2 Stars for service.

It has nice decor on the inside, a cool use of fish tanks to separate the kitchen. However, the food was really, just plain meh. The sizzling chicken clay pot was really really oily, with not that great of a flavor. It's rare that I won't eat a dish--but that was one of them. The waitress suggested greens in a garlic sauce--but really, $15 for that? Seems a little expensive in comparison with other dishes. Also, we ordered the pan fried house noodles...only to be brought the house fried rice. We told the waitress that we didn't order the noodles, but she pointed to a printed order receipt that she left on our table (which was entirely in Chinese), which said we had ordered the rice. Luckily the manager heard us arguing with the waitress, trying to say we never ordered fried rice and he was able to bring the pan fried noodles. But, really, I shouldn't have to be arguing with a waitress over what I clearly did not order. Noodles were tasty, but our receipt (the final one in english) charged us for the fried rice (which was more expensive) than the noodles. At that point, I didn't feel like arguing or complaining anymore....just decided it was enough reason to not return.

Was in town for the art and wine festival and also to pick up my contacts in downtown Mountain View. ?Decided to stop here for lunch after walking down the block. ?I was quite surprised, the service is different from the typical dim sum restaurant. ?The staff actually spoke English and take care of your needs. ?One of the items I had to order was the Shark Fin Dumpling Soup which was quite tasty compared to other dim sum restaurants. ?The dumpling itself was soft and tender, very delicate and still retain the flavor of the dumpling. ?The soup base itself is lighter than what I usually like, I personally think the soup base at Dynasty is perfect. ?The skin on the steamed dumplings are quite soft and chewy, but then on the pan seared chive dumpling the skin was way too thick and not desirable at all. ?Overall the food was just a little above average while service is better than comparable themed restaurants. ?This would be an alternative for dim sum in the South Bay for me.

I've been here twice for dimsum with my family. They have a good thing going here. The service is fast. I wish the servers would smile a little. They would not look so intimidating. WIth the way they looked, we were almost afraid to ask for drinks...We know they are just so busy and they have to move fast but still! They do a good job with the dimsum staples---shiu mai, hargow, shiu bao, hamsuyko, tofu wrap, chow fun, etc. The braised tripe needs a little longer cooking--still a little too chewy. I wish they'd go easy on the chili flakes. The other classics took too long to bring out---barbecue pork, roast duck, etc. The rice wrapped in leaves was all right. I do see they are making the effort at greater variety in the desserts, which is great. NOthing like something sweet to top off a meal. I'd come back, for sure. There is a man who walks around giving orders but he's friendly to customers. Must be the owner. If only his staff would follow his lead....

This place has THE WORST SERVICE EVER. So i went here for chinese new years dinner. We ordered couple entrees and late night dimsum dishes. We got our entree about 20 min after we ordered but dimsum NEVER CAME... We also asked for cold water and napkins but they never came around. We were about to be done with our food so we asked the owner where are food is and he said it takes a little longer. It already has been 40 min since we ordered food. he came back and said actually we didnt put in order. He didnt even bother apologizing. He just put in our order and food came out 20 min after... so once we got our bill, I put my card down. and They charged me more than what it said on the bill. I complained to the owner and instead of apologizing he said " DONT COME BACK HERE IF YOU DONT LIKE IT" who says that? why are you in the food industry if you are not gonna please anyone?? way to start a chinese new year.

This review is meant for the newly opened Fu Lam Mum. I liked the old one much better. After it moved the new location, the restaurant raised the price 50%. Sure, the new restaurant looks bright and nice. The food tastes as tasty as the old one. But does it warrant a 50% price increase? I think the owner now tries to serve the high-end market. Not sure it's unique enough to get a 5 stars for a high end restaurant though.

Food is so-so. ?It's the only dim sum place in the area, so it's super-crowded on Sundays, but you can get better dim sum outside of Mountain View. ?When I first moved to the bay area, about a decade ago, it was a shabby Cantonese place with no dim sum, with fish swimming in murky tanks. ?I went almost every weekend. ?That was before they renovated the place and jacked up the prices. ?Admittedly, the ambiance is much better, but I miss the old Fu Lam Mum which had better food for more reasonable prices.

Great food, great service at an average price given the location. Child-friendly! And the best service I've ever had at a dim sum restaurant. Lunchtime seating is fairly fast on a weekend even while the farmer's market is going on. Steamed food is good: I heartily recommend the Shanghai dumplings, which are delicious, and the fried scallion pancakes, which are likewise. There are a lot of winners on the menu. However, as mentioned by at least one other reviewer, their tea is surprisingly weak; it might not be worth it, except as something to wash away the fairly low level of grease.

Went to eat dim sum on Sunday for maybe the 6th or 7th time at Fu Lam Mum. Food is usually good but got a bonus hair in the fish yesterday. Not such a huge deal until we got the bill. 10 dishes, nothing super special for 2 adults and 1 child-$82.00! WHAT?! Nothing to drink but tea and 10 small dishes...asked the lady to double check...she said oops, they made a mistake. It's now $68.00. We think they were trying to rip us off! Especially since in the past the same type of meal has come to $30 to $45 before tip at the same restaurant.

Excellent dim sum. ?The restaurant is elegant and spacious, and they bring by a good variety of food.

Better than Ming's for Dim Sum but not as good as Tai Pan in Palo Alto. ?However, much cheaper than Tai Pan. ?Very noisy, even for a dim sum place, but spacious. ?No chance speaking English with most of the cart pushes but again that's pretty common. ?Some dishes were a bit salty.

I go here because I like the salt and pepper pork chops. The snow pea leaves are a bit pricey, so recommend avoiding unless you plan to pay $15 for vegetables. I think the standard is usually about $10-11. For these prices, go to King Crab in Milpitas.. a bit cheaper, and similar service quality.

A really great Hong Kong style restaurant. ?The food is excellent. ?The specials on the board offer some interesting dishes that we've thoroughly enjoyed. ?The service is very good. ?We've never waited too long for a table or for food. ?The maitre'd is very friendly and always makes us feel welcome. ?My family and I always enjoy eating dinner here and it's a favorite for us.

wow. ?this new fu lam mum is definitely.. different. ?its a beautiful, bright, airy restaurant now with a really modern feel. ?much more high class than the old fu lam mum, however it has the same NOISY patrons. ?i went here two days in a row for dimsum and the food was pretty much constant. ?they have pretty good dimsum that seems fresh and seems to have less msg than the average dimsum place. ?however, they don't have as much variety as other places and some of the dishes weren't very hot. ?one thing i didn't like was that many of my dimsum selections (hargow, sui mai) were stick together and to the steamer, those ripping the skin and having my shrimp tumble away. ?i think they have pretty decent prices though (2.50 s, 3 m, 4 l). ?the owner and manager are very nice but the other server (especially ladies in green vests) were not so nice. ?i don't know if they still have cheap late night eats, but i hope so! ?as of now, you are able to make reservations as well.

this is hands down our favorite place to eat when we're out and about or i haven't prepared anything for dinner. ?we actually live a bit far from castro st, but it's so worth the drive. ?you HAVE to go there after 9pm though to get the late night specials! ?everytime we go there we order dim sum (can't beat 3 items for $10!), the salt and pepper fish filet and cantonese chicken in a clay pot. ?it has a very lively atmosphere -- definitely not a super romantic date-night place, service is sometimes a little slow (and a few of the waiters are less friendly than others...), and most days it's pretty packed, but we always drive home super full and very satisfied.
