Fette Sau... 12 hours later I am still stuffed. Got a $60 platter of meat and destroyed 3/4 of it with my girlfriend. Took the rest home. Amazing meat. Everything was awesome. The pulled pork came up short compared to the other meats. We had boar belly, beef ribs, pork ribs, brisket, pulled pork, spicy sausage, broccoli and coleslaw. The broccoli was amazing and went awesome with the ribs. A few minutes into my meal I didn't know which meat I was stuffing in my mouth, just that I was freaking happy. Waited on line thirty minutes, with beer in hand. I hate waiting on lines and rarely do, but I would easily do it again. The guys sitting next to me had a fight with another group of guys about seating. Don't sit down until you have your food! Pretty simple rule. The turnover rate seems to coincide more or less with the movement of the line so we were able to grab our own spot right away. I'm so full... if you come here just make sure you pace yourself.

This place is amazing! Don't bring vegetarian friends though - they might go hungry and get a bit upset about all the meat. There's often a line, but it's well worth the wait as the meat is so tasty, and you can drink beer while you're waiting. As sides, I loved the beans but the broccoli was a bit weird (serves me right for trying to be healthy).

Best BBQ in NY! You will leave satisfied and stuffed! Still haven't had a chance to try the ribeye, but they had sirloin this time. It was good, but chewy if you go the wrong piece. The brisket is delish!! Skip the wild boar belly (too lean), and the ribs are still too dry for me. The pulled pork is decent. I don't love any of the sides, but the fatty meats and beer selection make up for that.

If you like BBQ and good whiskey you will have found heaven in Fette Sau. The Boy and I decided to trek out to Brooklyn because he'd been craving good BBQ for a while now. Both of us were Fette Sau virgins but aware of the hype surrounding this place. By the end of our dinner the only thing we were disappointed in was the inability to finish all of the food on our plates. The atmosphere is exactly how you'd expect it to be for a smokey market style BBQ joint in Williamsburg. It almost feels like you're in someones wood cottage, complete with faux fireplace. We rolled in on the early side (about 6pm) on a Thursday so had no issues with lines or grabbing seats. Thursdays are also Fat Pig Thursdays and the day the Pittmasters breakdown a whole smoked heritage pig! Yummmmm! Sorry Wilbur. If you like BBQ you really can't go wrong here - brisket, pork belly, ribs, pulled pork, everything was excellent (in that order)! If you don't like BBQ then I really don't even know why you're reading this review and considering going to a BBQ joint... The burnt-end baked beans are just as good as everyone says they are! probably the best baked beans I've ever had in my life. German potato salad and spicy sausage are both excellent too, I like my sausage spicy (that's what she said). There is a solid draft beer selection and a top notch whiskey selection. Really the most important piece of advice I can give you: COME HUNGRY!

I never thought I would fall in love with this place but as it turns out I was completely blown away. Not only was this some of the best meat i've ever tried in my life but also the absolute best baked beans you can imagine... simply divine! This place is highly recomended...try it out! There is often a line, but it is well worth the wait. Price is good, not too cheap but I wouldnt want to save on my meat..! Got to be safe! On top of it all the location is one of my favourites, the wooden benches outside are too cute and street its on is just great. Momofukus milk bar two buildings down.. great for a dessert! (if you can even move after alll that meat)

It really hurts me to give food this good such few stars, but let the hating commence! Came here with my best friend in search of our first taste of "authentic" BBQ. We heard all the stories of how packed it gets so we came pretty early. It seemed like we weren't too far back in the line, yet somehow we still ended up waiting about an hour for food. If the food was bad I'd be pretty pissed but it was far from it. We had Brisket, Pulled pork and boar belly. All meats were phenomenal! It was pretty expensive, but I was prepared for that and with how it all tasted seemed more justified than not. The dining set up is pretty cool with picnic tables arranged to create a communal eating atmosphere. Unfortunately the space is really small so we didn't have the opportunity to eat in the restaurant. Looking around the area where fette sau is located, I was really left wondering why they haven't expanded in some sort of way. Really the reason i gave them such few stars though is that with prices so high I would think you get get a little more with your meal. Instead every corner possible is cut. They gave us a 4 rolls to eat with 2.5lbs of meat and worst of all they gave us 1 small container of BBQ sauce*think the ones in McDonalds* ?for the entire meal. It honestly seems like a change in how the operation is managed can take this place to new heights, but as good as the food was the experience doesn't support the price. I can';t see myself being a Fette Sau regular. It's worth a try but it's not a place that goes into rotation.

The pork belly ROCKS! I've had the sausage, brisket, pulled pork, boar belly but nothing compares to the pork belly. I dropped in today a few minutes before some guy ordered the last of the pork belly WTF!!! He ordered a whole slab that must've been like 3 lbs, I mean come on! Sharing is caring! My friends and I ended up checking out the other bbq items on the menu but it wasn't the same. The potato salad is yummy, and Coke in a glass is a nice finishing touch. Definitely need to open another spot in the city. Long live pork belly!

This is pretty much the definition of BBQ.. this 1st time I tried to come here was on a Friday night at about 7-8p. I looked at the line and determined that no food was good enough to wait that long for. I was wrong. I tried again a few weeks later and good lucky with a short line and a couple seats. EVERYTHING was the best that I've ever had. Brisket, beans, greens.. it doesn't matter what you get. it'll be on point. To top it off, it's a whiskey bar! Whiskey is my favorite liqour, so when I explained my obsession with Irish whiskey, the bartender explained to me WHY I liked Irish whiskey and offered a few smooth, unique bourbons for me to try.. it was a happy night.

I had been to Fette Sau before, about a year and half ago and was pretty impressed. I returned last night and was disappointed in the changes. I had the brisket, which was way too fatty. I had to leave a big glob of fat on my tray! The pulled pork was flavorful, but dry, and all the meat was cold by the time we found a seat. To add insult to injury, the price of a tiny pour of bourbon was $20! I drink bourbon all over Williamsburg and know this a ridiculous mark up. I blame the influx of rich kid douchebags to the neighborhood. Tasteless people who are willing to pay whatever because they can. This really ruins it for the rest of us! Now restaurants think they can get away with charging extortionist prices for mediocre food.

whether you pony up to the bar for a great on tap beer, or just like ordering your food by the pound this place is a little slice of heaven. ?Every time we have gone we get a large group to go in on a couple pounds of meat, a few sides and a jug of cold beer in glass jars. I don't even live in Brooklyn, but this is a MUST if you are remotely interested in beer or good meat.

Stumbled upon this BBQ mecca by accident on a trip to Bk. Definitely glad I did, it truly is amazing. Its packed all year round so be prepared to wait about 15|20 minutes in line. There isn't a wait staff, just a counter where they weigh stuff out, I like this. I suggest going when its warm out, because more seating opens up outside, and who doesn't like beer and BBQ in the sun. One tip I have, besides gorging yourself with the great slow cooked meat items, is to get the burnt ends baked beans. I'll go on record saying these are the best beans I've ever tasted. They are a must try item.

You order your meats by weight, sides by container. ?The prices are really, really reasonable. ?Two people ate and brought food home for less than $30. ?If you want to take food home, be sure to tell them when ordering. ?Great variety of beers on tap. ?Meats change daily. ?It's worth the wait. Be sure to abide by the seating rules! ?Trust in turnover. ?Wait until you receive your food before sitting down at a table.

The food is just as amazing as everyone says it is BUT, minus one star for the "every man for himself" style seating. Seriously, you need a plan of attack once you step in here because you may never sit down.And this was on a Thursday night at around 9:30pm. ?I managed to snag two bar seats (it was luck I tell ya). Besides the seating, delicious meats and tasty beers abound. I highly recommend it!!

WOW- this brisket tops them all- fatty flavorfull damn delicious........Bare bones interior....put off by the lines many times, but ventured one late weekday afternoon. Meat- brisket perfection Sides- chipotle sweet potatoes, baked beans with burnt ends, broccoli salad The Parker rolls were a nice touch, better than the white bread at Hill Country. The spicy, sweets were a home run as were the deep, dark baked beans- freakin' amazing. The brisket is pricey- whole meal cost $30 and that was for 4 slices of brisket, but it was worth it for the soulful barbecue. Summer chow outside on the picnic tables beckons... Best brisket!

Aaa-maaa-zing. Best bbq around. Get the brisket and a side of beans. Expect to wait on line Friday and Saturday nights. Up to 1.5 hours during the summer. Totally worth it, drink beer while you wait. A must go, don't miss it. I mean it. How it works: Get in line, read the specials for the day, see what looks good (who am I kidding, it all does!), choose how much you want in terms of pounds. I split 1.5 lbs with one other person with a small beans and broccoli which was plenty of food and a half gallon of beer. Get some bread and make little snadwiches with either the brisket or the beans. Dabble with the bbq sauces on the table. Enjoy :-)

My God. The wait and crowd here makes me want to pull my hair and eyes out. This place is a garage (Literally. It still has the garage door.) that barely has enough hard cafeteria tables to sit a classroom of 5th graders, let alone the line of people waiting to place their order. I can't tell if the line is a reflection of their popularity, or a reflection of the sheer inefficiency of the staff. First of all, there are two separate lines for drinks and food. Once you're done ordering and carrying your enormous tray of meat (it comes on a piece of wax paper on top of a steel stray), you'll have to teeter your way over to the bar to get drinks. My friend had the grand idea of bringing her group of 10+ friends to Fette for her birthday, and it took us a while to stake out enough space for all of us. Naturally, we ordered a lot of food and drinks. And naturally, we took a bit of time to get through all that we ordered. It wasn't long before a blonde hipster chick comes sneering to us that she is sitting next to us and she has no space for her boyfriend, and that we have to (a) finish up or (b) sit on each other's lap to accommodate for her boyfriend, who must clearly be 500 lbs if he can't squeeze in at the end of the table. We responded by ignoring her and mentally vowing to throw one of Fette Sau's storebought hamburger rolls at her face. Seriously, everybody is cranky that they're being forced to eat meat in a garage so let's all be friends and accept the fact that there's NO SPACE IN THIS PLACE. But onto the food... Most of the stuff here is dry-rub, so don't expect any savory glazes on any of these meats. The tables come with 2 BBQ sauces -- one sweet, one spicy. The pulled shoulder was oily and kind of tasteless without the aid of the aforementioned BBQ sauces. The pork ribs were also dry and tasteless. The sausage was tough. The beef items were a lot better -- I thought the brisket was great. It was juicy and the rub was savory and spicy. The house cured pastrami, was a little chewy and gummy, but the taste was there. The sides are an abomination of all BBQ places. The potato salad was ultra cold and way too vinegary. So was the broccoli salad (really? I came here to eat meat...not raw broccoli doused in more vinegar). The cherry on top was that there was NO MAC AND CHEESE. The only saving grace of the sides we ordered were the beans -- more like a chili than beans, and quite possibly one of most flavorful parts of my meal. Better options are Dino BBQ and Hill Country.

After walking the lengths of Brooklyn we finally made it to Fette Sau where we were lucky enough to jump in line right before a huge crush of people arrived. ?Usually the wait here is outrageous and they don't take reservations so we totally lucked out! ?We took full advantage of the menu ordering the brisket, pork ribs, pickles and coleslaw. ?I also had to order a Cheerwine since this southern cult drink is hard to find in the Northeast. The overall review is that the BBQ was incredible, the BBQ sauce was even better (I slathered my beef in it) and the pickles/coleslaw were okay. ?Oh and the Cheerwine was just as refreshing and sweet as always!

Damn the wait really sucks. Like, I'll probably never come back again unless a friend is in from out of town or it's another special occasion. Seating is also very limited and self-serve with lots of snooty glances and pestering people. Logistics aside, the food is pretty fabulous. You can also order beer and drink while waiting. Cool that the beer comes in glass mason jars though it was annoying since they don't have smooth drinking lips. I came for a friend's birthday party and she ordered a gluttonous amount of meat and sides. It came with 40 potato rolls and the food could've fed an entire city somewhere. However, the group of 10-15 gorged on what seemed like endless amounts of pulled pork, beef brisket, spicy sausages, beef tongue, pork ribs and various sides. There were a few different sauces on the table which you could slather ?your food in--I believe one was standard BBQ and the other was a chipotle BBQ which packed a bit of heat. All in all, the food was pretty good quality with a few standouts. The beef brisket was really tender and flavorful as was the pulled pork. The sausages were nothing special and the ribs lacked the juiciness that I've found at other BBQ establishments. The sides were not very memorable, though I only tried a few. Beans looked the most promising but I didn't get a chance to indulge. I personally like Hill Country better since the wait is nowhere near as long and the food is similar in quality. There is also much more seating space and variety of sides.

I was slightly disappointed with this place, and i've been wanting to try it ever since Matt Lang was on pitmasters. ?It was cool to have him ring me up though. My friend and I got extremely lucky, and did not have to wait too long, 15/20 minutes. ?As neither of us had been here, we figured, let's try a lot. ?I ordered some pulled pork, some brisket, pork ribs, and burnt ends baked beans. ?My friend ordered brisket, beef ribs, pork belly, and also the burnt ends baked beans. ? Our first bite was of the baked beans as so many people have already wrote about and raved, and we were pleasantly surprised with it. ?Then, it kind of went downhill. ?Our briskets didn't match up, which was odd, considering we got first and second cut off a freshly placed hunk of meat. ?My brisket was delicious, nice, tender, and juicy, my friends, not so much. ?My pulled pork was just lacking, as were my pork ribs, there was a complete lack of meat on them. ?The pork belly was pretty good, but the beef rib was incredible. ? We could have come up with a 4 star dish, beef rib, my brisket, and the baked beans, but it still would not have got a 5. ?It's unfortunate that there were downfalls with some of the food. ?And what hurts it even more is it's not cheap, at all. ?$30 and $40 respectively. ? What is really cool about the place is the atmosphere, setup, and bar/beer selection. ?The meat case is right in front of you when you order, everything is cut to order, but the major downside to that is, a lot of the meat doesn't stay warm as there is only one person taking and prepping your order. ?I can't imagine what this place is like when it's warmer out and there is a ridiculous line. ?You'd order your food, and have to wait forever to get a seat. ? Is it worth the try, yeah. ?Will I come back anytime soon, unfortunately not.

Fett Sau is so delicious!! ?It's really everything I want for bbq - flavorful, not dried out, good sides (beans and corn)...and all served on a cafeteria tray. ?It's so much fun digging into this mess of food with my friends hahaha. ?They serve jugs of beer. ?It all adds up to a very enjoyable atmosphere. ?Ribs were good, brisket was good, pulled pork was good -- If you're a meat ?lover, you definitely need to check out this place. ? I liked it better than Hill Country BBQ (although that might be a function of my not over-eating at Fette Sau like I did at Hill Country...) I did walk by it a few times because I'm an idiot and didn't see the sign "Fette Sau". ?My nose was instead buried in my Google Maps' GPS. ?It's useful to look at the Yelp pictures to see what the exterior looks like.

The BBQ is great here, but the lack of a line and the communal seating is a complete fail. In the super aggressive, type A populated metropolis of NYC, getting a seat at Fette Sau can be a nightmare. If only Fette Sau added a rope or something to seal off the line, then the seat stealing and line cutting could be avoided. We were lucky that we came on a less busy night and were able to get a seat without too much trouble, but I was getting grumpy and stressed while we were waiting for a seat. We waited our turn and were first in line, then a few people entered the restaurant and pounced on a table that we were waiting for. We let one lady slide, but the next one we calmly explained that we had been waiting. I wonder how many fights have broken out over seating at this place? Now that we have thoroughly exhausted the subject of the seating, let's move on to the more important part: the food. We had cheek, brisket, pork belly and pulled pork. The most flavorful was the cheek, but my favorite was the brisket because it was so tender. For our sides we had baked beans, potato salad and sauerkraut. The baked beans were the best side by a mile. All in all the bbq was top notch and would warrant a 4 star. I gave the subtracted one star due to the line situation so Fette Sau is a solid 3 star. If you live in Williamsburg there is no excuse not to visit this place, but if you're in Manhattan I'd only make the trek if you have a lot of time to kill.

GOOD GOD YES. Is there better pulled pork then this? I think not.... Great Brooklyn BBQ, also excellent Brooklyn IPA on tap. The ambiance is very casual and communal (if you don't mind sitting next to complete strangers who may be a little tipsy, but jovial - then this is definitely the place for you). The food is amazing, with generous portions for the sides - the small baked beans was more than enough for two people. Other reviewers are right in that it can get a little crazy with the line, however, the food is definitely worth it. We went on New Year's Eve, and it wasn't too bad at all - had to wait in line for about 25 minutes, but we stopped at the bar and drank our drinks in line for the food. Overall A+ dining experience, if you don't mind getting close and personal with a few strangers - it's New York City after all.

Brooklyn Based BBQ that went up and beyond! Pretty good bbq. For those from the south, I would compare the quality to that of Rudy's. ? FOOD: Very delicious and they are good at their craft. We tried as much as we could without breaking our bank lol! We had the - Pork Ribs ($16/lb) - We had 2 ribs however many lbs that was - Sasuage Links ($4 per link) - Got 1 link - Brisket ($19/lb) - We had 1/2 a lb - Pork Belly ($19/lb) - We had 1/2 a lb All the prices are subject to change depending on season/market values. Everything well season and well cooked. The hyped pork belly was tasty and fatty depending on which cut you get. But the brisket was the winner here! That is a must eat! If you get a nice cut, it can be fatty and juicy! The ribs were decently fall of the bone type-esque as well. Maybe not the softest type you will have if you go to the south like Rudy's or Saltlick but still pretty good. The price is on the pricey side, but hey, this is New York and somewhat expected. SERVICE: Just like any other type of BBQ/smoke house. Buffet/stand in line order type. ATMOSPHERE: Had a refurbished warehouse vibe. Brick wall partitions with metal/wooden bench seats and counters with a LCD TV. There is a clear garage door closed when we went, but it most likely can open up and the restaurant can open to the outdoors. ?Nice design tying in the inside with the outside if that is true. ? SUMMARY: Delicious BBQ but a tad bit pricey. ?If you are willing to shell out the dollar bills, then you will NOT be disappointed. This Williamsburg original will get you going with all your taste buds going full throttle! I suggest trying the brisket, porkbelly and pork ribs the first time.

Lets face it, men are obsessed with bbq or anything that has to do with meat and beer. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. While we were approaching the restaurant we started to salivate, the amazing aroma of this restaurant can be smelled from a mile away. So let me describe to you the moment we went in, I told him "Vlad brace yourself". He looked at me and said, "Oh my" As we glanced at the walls we have saw the artifacts drawn on the walls, ?it was like going through an egyptian cave and seeing hieroglyphics. We saw pictures of pigs and jugs of beer. It was eye candy, then we glanced to the counter that has the bbq in it, I felt my eyes salivating. Thats how good it was. The worker was very nice, and actually asked us if we wanted our meat to be meaty or more fatty. I personally like a little bit of both, we tried to pulled pork, brisket and beef belly. They were all very tasty. I strongly suggest to get more potato rolls then they give you.. you'll be needing them. Also, the drinks are very good, theres a huge selection. Bottom line: We were in Meatlovers Heaven.

I don't have the patience to wait for a table here so have done take out... Large unctuous portions of pork belly, brisket and pulled pork with some sticky sweet baked beans, their butter buns and some pickles are all you need. ? They do however need to invest in some better take home containers...the brown bag was soaked through with all of the mat juices and grease and so I almost ended up having everything fall out onto the street before I made it home. A bit over blown for what they do, but it's still good.

Pretty decent barbecue. Nothing really blew my mind, but it was still quite well done. Walking in, it's a communal bench setting. Getting a seat can be hard when it's cold as no one really wants to sit outside. While my friend waited on line for food, I ordered a Sixpoint Signal. I highly recommend this beer. Between the two of us, we had 1/2 lb. of pork belly and brisket. It came with 4 free rolls, but I would order an order an extra per person. The brisket was a bit dry, though the dried burnt parts with the rub or fatty parts was fantastic. The pork belly was better. It was seriously good pork as eating all that fat was delicious. The sauces were decent. A vinegar. The horseradish was overpowering and I found inedible. I would mix the sweet BBQ sauce and the spicy chipotle sauce for a balanced sauce.

Nice beer list and juicy fatty brisket. Kelso on tap, soft rolls, and brisket sitting at bar late at night in an almost empty place. It was a joy. That being said I am not one to drink the Kool Aid and jump on the bandwagon to gush about this place. I still think it's a bit overrated and don't get the wonderous appeal that people seem to have with it. I have always avoided this place because I refuse to wait on long ass lines that can take close to an hour just to order. Then, you have to order drinks seperately at the bar. Even though they have a good beer and whiskey list this just doesn't make sense to not be able to set up a system to order all at once. Then there is the deal with fighting the crowd to find a spot to eat. I got there last night around 10pm after a Yelp event close by and it was so nice and empty. During normal hours this place is a zoo. It always seems crowded which attests to it's popularity with the hipster locals. ?Plus, in summer warm weather it becomes a sweat box as it is in an old garage. Sure, it has a cool grungy character to it, but if I am going out to eat and pay top dollar for a meal I prefer to eat hot bbq in the comfort of air conditioning. Still, they do make some pretty good brisket here. A bit pricey though. Had a plate of it last night. Theirs is more on the fatty side, and very juicy. Along with some soft supermarket bought rolls and a mason jar of Kelso beer I sat at the bar and filled up. It was a good way to end the night. I would definitely come back again as long as there were no lines like last night! To each their own I guess. I still prefer Mabel's Smokehouse a few minutes away.

THAT WAS ENJOYABLE. I always avoided Fette Sau because of the Six-Flags esque queue that seems to form in front of their garage. Don't get me wrong, I've been meaning to try but I haven't had much time. Fortunately, today was my day off, so I met my company at the door @ 5PM sharp, opening time. No lines, we had the place to ourselves for a good 5 minutes! :) I'm going to itemize my review according to what I had. BBQ is serious business, so no fluff. I'll keep it simple. Pulled Pork: Full of flavor and vinegary/peppery notes, but ultimately dry and crusty. I would love to have drenched this in their sweet BBQ sauce, but I had other territory to conquer. Pork Ribs: Hammy, middling flavor. The quality of the pork was top notch, however... To be fair, I'm a bigger fan of beef ribs. Moving on..... Pork Belly: ?Absolutely epic porkbelly. Full of delicious porky fat which compliments the dry seasoning perfectly. This is possibly my new favorite way to eat pork belly. Imagine a ribbon of the mosttender ham with a peppery aftertaste, lined with an exquisite umami ribbon of fatness melting in your mouth and you have Fette Sau Pork Belly. Beef Brisket: Wow. I had this last, and I couldn't get enough. I digress, I was porked out at that point, so the beefy contrast bade well for my palate. Tons of fat and tender beef: the best of both worlds. This is no thinly sliced dry brisket. ?I couldn't decide whether I like this or the pork belly more!!! Additional notes: Broccoli salad is a nice palate cleanser, and was deliciously marinated (served cold). The cheaply nostalgic bread rolls are a step up from wonderbread, and are shamefully tasty after overwhelming yourself with protein. Long story short: PORK BELLY and BEEF BRISKET. COME EARLY.

Holy moly! This is the best BBQ I have ever had that's not from someone's backyard! I usually like my BBQ swampy in sauce, but the dry-rubbed meat was so tender and tasty that I didn't use any of the many available condiments, not even hot sauce! Excellent beer choices and sides! Community tables are always awkward but we went on the later side and it was not hard to find space for six.

The best thing here are the ribs which were much better than the ones at Dinosaur or Hill Country. I was looking forward to their sausage but it was just wayyy too fatty! One bite and I squirted oil across the table... The pulled pork could have been more moist. The brisket was all right... Nothing really stood out. Thank God I didn't have to endure a long wait! Came here on a random weekday at about 6pm and there was only one group in front of me. If I had to wait longer than 10-15 minutes to order, it wouldn't be worth it at all!!

One could go on about the enormous line that usually plagues this place, but the real trick is just to try and go when there won't be many people there. Late fternoons are good...and now that football season has started, Sunday evenings are GREAT...the place is damn near empty. I went in earlier tonight and there was NO...LINE. As for the food? You must get: Baked beans, pulled pork, and ribs You might wanna get: the brisket...it's alright, but some cuts are a bit too fatty. You could probably live without ever trying: the sausage...it's just not done very well...If you want a good sausage, go to Lorely down the road...OR....go to the meat hook and get yourself sausage to take home. Finally, if they have lamb on the menu, don't hesitate to gobble that up the moment you see it. It should not be missed.

Two words: pork belly. I love barbecue. I've been raised to love it, with a mother who, after emerging from surgery and a medically induced coma, began dreaming about the next time she'd have access to ribs. While waiting for a table at Williamsburg's St Anselm last week, my date and I decided to head over to Fette Sau for appetizers and see what was up. We weren't disappointed. We chose the pork belly with a side of beans, which came accompanied by two rolls. Our portion was hand-carved in front of us, served up on a cafeteria-style metal tray. We ate at the bar, perusing their extensive whiskey list. While I think of myself as a barbecue snob, I hadn't ever experienced pork belly before. It was tender, perfectly smoked, a nice balance between the dry smoked barbecue that I'm used to and the saucy Carolina style. The fat was beginning to caramelize in a way that inspired reverence. The beans were smoky with a hint of spice, the rolls soft and perfect for sopping up sauce. All in all, incredibly tempting to ditch the main meal and try every cut that Fette Sau offered. I'll be back.

5 stars for the food, 4 for the wait and semi-stressful seating situation. I am okay with waiting to eat something super tasty in the end and I also like the grungy garage vibe, but it does get really cold in the winter and since it is set up like a cafeteria seating system, its not the best for accommodating larger parties. I came here with a group of friends, so we ended up ordering a lot of food to share. For sides, we ordered the potato salad, broccoli salad and baked beans. The potato salad is not your typical kind with an excessive amount of mayo in it (gross).. instead, it is a lighter vinegar/oil dressing with a grainy mustard. Good balance of flavors and the mustard was not overpowering at all. I was a big fan of the broccoli salad - its light dressing of what I'm assuming was a combo of olive oil, garlic and crushed red pepper flakes complimented all the heavy meats well. Lastly, the beans .. I usually stray away from any beans, but I gave these a try and actually enjoyed them. I'm no baked bean connoisseur but one of my friends claimed that these were the best baked beans he had ever had, so they must have been good! ?All orders are also served with potato rolls, which are perfect for dipping in the burnt end baked beans or that last drop of bbq on your plate.. On to the meats! We got the pork belly, the beef brisket, the pulled pork, and a rack of ribs. Everything was so tender and had a perfect fat to meat ratio. The pork belly was incredibly rich and melt-in-your-mouth, and the brisket and ribs were really tender and flavorful. Add both the sweet and spicy bbq sauces to it all... so so good! Good bbq flavor with the right amount of smokey taste. Bonus points for good beers on tap which they serve to you in mason jars. If you are going to commit to waiting for Fette Sau, just try as much as you can because everything is delicious! It might be nicer to go here when it's not freezing outside, but I imagine the wait will be much longer in the warmer weather months.. either way, definitely try!

Much akin to Roberta's, the trend of opening up an eatery in a garage is also found at Fette Sau. My girlfriend and I found out about this place a while ago from a friend of hers who had went and made some Facebook post about the great BBQ and outrageously long line. With both of us ?being curious to try, we finally made the trip out a few weeks ago, late on a Monday afternoon. We drove out here, but whether you drive or take the L train, this place is a bit of a hike. After lucking out and finding street parking, we had about 30 or 40 minutes until they opened. It was a warm night, so we just hung out on the street and talked until the sign was turned on and the gate was opened. Since we'd arrived, a few other people had also shown up, but the scene was very calm at their 5pm opening. Inside can be described as casual, cool and hipster. We went up to the counter and asked how we go about ordering. The server asked if it was our first time - it was - and then advised that between the two of us, we'd want a pound of meat. We opted to go with the beef brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork and pork belly, which came out to be 1/4 pound of each, except for the ribs. We were served four ribs, which came out to 3/4 lb, but there are bones in the ribs as well. We also got an ear of corn, a ginger beer and the meal came with four rolls, which comes in handy for dipping remnants of the meat juices and BBQ sauces. About the food, the brisket, pork ribs and pork belly were all really good. They were juicy, tender, meaty and well seasoned. The pork ribs were especially tender and fell right off the bone. The pork belly was a bit fattier than the other meats, but that's to be expected. My one gripe - and it's a big one - was that the pulled pork was extremely dry, which also took away some of the flavor. I don't know if this is the way it's normally served, but I hope they were just having an off night. The corn was also nothing to write home about, tho my girlfriend liked it, so I let her eat it. As others have noted, the seating is communal at long picnic tables. As the place wasn't too crowded, people will sit down next to you, but weren't elbowing or being rude in trying to claim seats. More people did show up as we ate, but the environment was always calm and collectively cool. I did ask when the line starts becoming legendary, to which they replied it usually happens later in the evening. Don't forget to check out the bar while you're here. The list of whiskeys and beers on tap is impressive. My other gripe, other than the extremely dry pulled pork, was that they were out of cider. No deductions for that tho. All in all, except for the pulled pork, the meal was yummy and the food and drink ran us $38. However, while the meal was delicious, I'd have been annoyed if I'd sat (or stood) through a two hour wait to eat here.

Real barbecue! Right here in New York! I love it! The decor is great: equal parts Austin smokehouse and Brooklyn mixer. The bartender rocks: totally chill lady who didn't mind striking up a conversation while we waiting for our friends to show up. The meats are THE BOMB: the brisket is juicy, the porkbelly is to-die-for, and the sausage is perfectly spicy and sweet. Problems (minor): 1) Kind of pricey... I spent over $20 just on myself. 2) You can't order drinks WITH your meat. You have to go back to the bar and pay separately. Being lazy, I was deterred from ordering another beer because of this. A silly inconvenience. I'll be back. Happily. Oh, and PRO-TIP: if you go at a weird hour, like 6PM, and especially if it's raining, there's NO wait and plenty of seating. Awesome!

I just wanted to start my review off with a fuck yeah. and a clip of Meg Ryan faking an orgasm. So this place has really good BBQ. If you haven't seen it before it looks like your about to walk into someones garage or something. This is the only place where I've waited in line and didn't care. I will say that the last time I was here i felt like it wasn't as good. But I also came a day after eating at Babbo. So yeah. My bad. K. Focus. The food here is really awesome. The best BBQ in my opinion in the city. ANNND I'm giving this place 5 stars because like after 11PM they will sell the rest of their meat inventory on potato buns for a few bucks....thats where the fuck yeah comes into factor. Everyone is really nice and patient. Sometimes the fattey's behind you (ohhhhh see what I did!?!?!) get a little overly eager. Just shoot em down with your I don't giiiiiivvvvveeee aaaaaa ffffuuuuuuuccckkkk face. Go here - your taste buds will thank your cheeks and teeth for left overs later.

Solid, solid BBQ. Love the hipster, unpretentious vibe. Love the communal tables and dark, cozy feeling in the room. Pretty bar. The line takes awhile to move, but it gives you plenty of time to decide what to get. Came around 6 on a Sunday and waited about 15 minutes, but the place was not too crowded. Ordered a slice of brisket, 1/4 lb. of pulled pork, 4 pork ribs, a spicy pork sausage link, pickles, potato salad and sauerkraut. Everything is sold by the pound and seems like there are 6-7 options each night in addition to a rotation of sides. Staff was really nice and friendly at the counter to order. Love that they give you potato rolls with your meal (we made little pulled pork sandwiches with them which was delicious). Pulled pork was pretty good, felt like it could have been a bit more moist. Brisket was amazing. Probably my favorite meat that I tried that evening. Sausage was really good but I would have had a hard time finishing it on my own--sharing is caring. Pork ribs were good but not the best I've had. German potato salad, sauerkraut and pickles were all solid. I loved the BBQ/horseradish/spicy chipotle sauces on the tables too. Overall, for all that, it was about $18/person for 2. No drinks. Definitely not a stop I'm going to make too often, but when I'm craving BBQ in an easygoing setting, Fette Sau will be my spot.

This place is pretty incredible. The line system and absence of waiter service is refreshingly no-nonsense (and means no paying tip), the meat and sides are top-notch, and the prices are reasonable; a friend and I paid about $15 each for a half pound of high-quality meat and a "small" side per person. Nothing we ate was anything less than delicious, but the brisket stood out--probably because it was the fattiest thing on the tray, but still. Free rolls were an added bonus.

Absolutely worth a 40 minute wait, wading through tightly-packed hipsters holding their Bell mason jars full of Brooklyn IPA. Communal seating, though vast, was still at a premium at 8 p.m. on a Friday night. Though I'm normally not "that person" that's about to hold seats for friends (as I do believe in "first come, first serve" in order to be fair to all), when your best friend has a disability and walks with a cane, you're damn straight I'm piling out coats on a bench, giving the evil eye to anyone that even dare glance at our end of the table. I did not get the pleasure of seeing the meats up close prior to them being piled on our meat trays. However, my friend Ozzie was in line, collecting our charred animal flesh, and he took ample Instagram documentation of meat being sliced for us, just as nature intended. I said "meat tray" previously. There is no exaggeration. Our meat was haphazardly piled onto a giant metal tray. The last time I had meat on a platter as such, I was in some wine village near Vienna, Austria, eating unknown meats from the bone off of ceramic platters, drinking red wines and having Austrian men play the fiddle 3 feet from my ear. Fette Sau provided me with a similar situation...well, except replace everything I just mentioned with a roaring fire...on the flat screen television and LCD Soundsystem coming through the speakers above my head. The meat, this time, was much more easy to identify. FACT: I could eat their Black Angus Beef Brisket every damn day for the rest of my life. The meat to fat marbling ratio was spot on, and it was cooked to absolute perfection. Though I did dip a few pieces into the sweet BBQ sauce for a bit of variety, it's perfect all on its own. TRUST ME. The Berkshire Country boneless ribs were a little bit of perfection as well. OH, the way the meat fell apart in my fork...in was almost artful. Needless to say, 1 & 1/2 pounds of meat is enough for three hungry men (...yes, I was a man that night). I could have had more! Add a Doc's Hard Cider and a bag of garlic dill potato chips to the mix, plus about six PERFECT potato rolls and...YEAH. The walk back to the L train was seemingly long, as I was weighed down with too much cow, potatoes, and alcohol. (Luckily, my partial Irish heritage / DNA did me a solid that night, allowing me to handle that trifecta, and I was able to pull through.) Fette Sau's got it right. In the words of Homer Simpson, "You don't win friends with salad!" Indeed, Fette Sau is winning many friends with its meat.

This place was pretty damn good. The line was pretty long on a Saturday night from 9-10ish, and it took some aggressive hovering to secure room at one of the communal tables, but the vibe was very brooklyn (friendly brooklyn... not 'I'm a hipster so I'm cooler than you and what are YOU doing here' brooklyn), and the meats were delicious. I love me some meats. Here's some bonus advice: - To try and distract yourself from staring at other people's food and quite possibly drooling on them, you should jump to the bar and get some drinks for the wait (bourbon? growlers of beer?)* - Depending on group size, you should send people to find seats while other people wait in line. If you're lucky and don't have a lot of.... umm... pride?.... someone who over-ordered might offer you some of their food as they leave (not that I would know personally... /they looked normal! and they were all sharing anyway! and I was a little drunk! ...not a big deal. seriously. just let it go.) - DEFINITELY order to share, and don't miss out on the pulled pork (cover with BBQ sauce), or the brisket, or the potato salad, or the lamb....... actually, this is isn't even advice because everything was really good and I'm not helping anyone by just listing the menu... so I'll stop. Finally, sitting near the flatscreen TV playing a video of a fire will not make you warmer (well... maybe a little because of the electricity... but if so, it's negligible.) __________________________ *Note: this will backfire and make you more hungry/likely to drool on people.

It was just me and 3 men in Brooklyn (sounds like a porn title). Where oh where could we go? I've heard amazing things about Fette Sau and I knew that my boys would be more than happy somewhere where meat is ordered by pound increments, beer is served by the gallon, and the whiskey list is long and mighty. The line was pretty long. We may have waited about 30-40 minutes, and I was pretty nervous that we wouldn't be able to find a table. But the staff does an awesome job at ensuring you can't sit and hold a table before you get your food, and this makes things run well and have a good rotation. I was instantly intimidated when I was ready to order, especially since my husband and our friends' put me in charge of ordering for everyone. I had no idea how much meat to order per person, but the butcher helped me without a problem. And we ended up with the perfect amount of food. My favorite of the meats we got, was by far, the Pulled Pork. It was delicious and tender and amazing, especially on their soft potato rolls (ORDER EXTRA OF THESE!) We also got brisket and the ribs. Everyone liked the ribs but the piece I had got was really tough - but everyone else said theirs was tender. For our sides, we got the Burnt End Beans, Dante's German Potato Salad & Guss' Half Sour Kosher Pickles. The beans are a must. I can't express this enough. The beans are A-MAZ-ING. I also loved the potato salad, especially since I like more vinegary based salads than mayo based. This is a German potato salad not American, so don't expect your typical picnic mayo-potato salad. Pickles are amazing, but can you ever go wrong with pickles? Enjoy the BBQ sauces they have on each table, try them all and decide on your favorite. Mine was the vinegar based BBQ. One is very sweet and one is super spicy. They have a nice selection of local beer that's served by the gallon. If you can't be happy at a place that serves up delicious BBQ and beer by the gallon, then we can't be friends.

Hurricane gail force winds, psst! I gotta Yelp baby!! Listen, this is a mixed review. My wife is saying never again, my oldest son and I are saying when you go to visit your grandmother we'll be here. Mary Mary, why ya buggin? This is a very Brooklyn eclectic joint. I can't see this place working in Long Island. Here's a conversation if this place was open in Lawg Island: Shelly - How long do we wait on this line? Marvin - What type of facacta place is this? There's no roof? And the spices make my piles flair. Shelly- Lets go to the Cheesecake factory instead See ya! No.. this is a Brooklyn joint. Yeah, you're gonna wait for it but what a wait baby. Brooklyn BBQ is in... the house! Did you ever play that game as a kid where you told a story to five people and the last person had a different story than how it first started? My wife was like, the duck was peppery, The beans tasted burnt, too much rub on the ribs, the pork belly was too fatty and the brisket was cut thick and too dry. (She also quipted about Mission Chinese) My kids were like, did we eat the same food? If your partner sounds like my wife and doesn't like different, funky foods don't come here. If you're into a funky good time, read on my Yelpin' bud. Duck - BBQ Duck? Crazy man. It was a little peppery but tasty. The dark meat was juicy. Ribs - Thick cut with a nice rub and cooked perfectly. Deelish Brisket & Pork belly ?- They put both in the same wrapper. OMG, When I opened it up, there was so much juice. The pork belly was a little fatty but it was PACKED with flava! I thought the same regarding the brisket. Sides - Beans? yuckk, Burnt, sloppy mess. I give one to my wife. They arent too big on sides here? Dinosaur has the best to date with the BBQ fried rice. This is a fun date place. A nice summer night with some good friends, beers and Pork Belly. (forget the beans)

Just try not to accidentally order way too much food... try. Great set up, awesome bbq, but ordering by the weight always fucks me. And a little of everything is a lot. I go about 3 times a year when I get a hankerin' for some BBQ and am always wayyyy too satisfied. ? Make sure to try the beans.

Briefly ... The wait is long, and worth it. Grab a beer or two and make friends in the line. We tried every meat that was available, and while all were outstanding, the beef ribs were the memory-makers. Marbled, juicy, smoky and absolutely immense, like a mountain of meat. Finally, while all the proteins were in need of a little salt (a good thing, as you can only make things more salty, not less salty), they were most certainly not in need of moisture or flavor - dipping this meat in BBQ sauce will only subtract from your dining experience.

This may come as a surprise, but in my opinion Fette Sau has officially jumped the shark. Or the shoulder, or the pork belly. Or whatever, I think their decline has arrived... but I hope not! 3 years ago, it was my favorite BBQ in NYC. Now, it is not even ranked, and I actually am offended by the price and quality. I recently had some dried out beef ribs with some inedible fat, a meager little piece of sausage, and 4 pork ribs including one rib sliced with no meat that they weighed and charged me for. Altogether a lot of bones and barely any meat... for the price of 28 dollars. That's right, just me, some bones, and a small amount of actual BBQ for... TWENTY EIGHT dollars. I have had better BBQ for $14 at Blue Smoke, Mables, and Hill Country. I'm not sure what is going on here, but I do not recommend this place anymore. Obviously, I hope this changes! Go across the street to St Anselm, it's not BBQ but it's the same owner and a much better place to spend your money. Or head to Mables in the hood for some solid 'cue.

WOW. If you are looking for some good BBQ, then look no forward. I came here on a recent Friday evening with my family (around 6:30pm) with the full intention on eating my body in smoke meats. I came in with high hopes and didn't leave disappointed. The brisket was hands down my favorite (probably the best brisket I have ever eaten). The pulled pork (was good, but was so much better when eaten on the rolls with some of their sauce) and the sausage and beans were also great (both a little spicy). I loved everything about the place besides for the fact that there isn't much seating and the line to get food takes a long time. There was only 1 guy cutting the meats (super inefficient) and not much seating room (I felt rushed the entire meal with people hovering over me looking for an opening to sit down). Cant wait to come back when it gets a little warmer and they open up the garage door to open up the place a little. Also a great beer and whiskey selection.

Seriously some of the best BBQ I've ever had. Was in North Carolina and got BBQ and it didn't even compare to Fette Sau. I've been several times and have literally never been disappointed.

Best BBQ in NYC. From strictly a bbq meat perspective, this place is the best. The way the restaurant is laid out is horrific, so if you plan on going here, go early in the day on a weekday. Avoid weekends altogether. Every meat and side here I've tried is highly recommended - from the baked beans to the pulled pork, brisket, pork belly, etc. It's all quality and you probably won't be disappointed. Large beer and whiskey selection, although somewhat overpriced. With open seating (and very limited seating in the winter) coupled with ONE GUY slicing meat to order for each customer, there is always a line. Though the food is great, I would never wait an hour or more standing in a line and then not be guaranteed a seat. ?The supply chain logistics are what they are, so if you want the food, pick an off-peak time and prepare to wait.

Fette Sau doesn't quite earn five stars in my book but it was good so I'm rounding the rating up to four stars. Decor: 3.5/5 -Looks like it was a garage in the past and converted to a sit down bbq restaurant -So many hipsters. I felt out of place Service: 3.5/5 -Wait time on a Saturday 4pm was 45 minutes. Decent yet slow. Food: 3.5/5 -Beef Brisket was the best. You must add sauce because its slightly bland without it. The best combination was the vinegar and sweet bbq sauce. -Pulled Pork was overcooked and a bit dry. The sauces helped but the beef brisket was still the best -Spicy Sausage was disappointing. There was no flavor, just pure fat. It wasn't even spicy either! -Potato rolls were great with the baked beans. The baked beans were a bit on the salty side but had a good porky flavor

the place is kinda cool. The Brisket and the ribs were very soft and tender, the pulled pork and the tips were ok.. They were good, but you can get similar in other places as well. their sauces were good. they had about three different types of sauces. We also tried their pickles, which I found to be a little on the cucumber side rather than the pickle taste side. The beans, eh. I've had better. over all in all the food was good!! the only problem I had was the waiting. it is a communial seating arrangement. first come, first serve. there was plenty of seating, if you were willing to sit in the cold. Here's an idea forthe restaurant. if you enclosed the outside seating as you did the outer entrance you would be able to use those picnic tables outside during the winter and then in the summer you could remove the "Skin" and it would still be cool enough to sit outside. just a thought. Over all it was a pleasant experience. We will be back!

Two words- BEEF BRISKET. ?Fatty, juicy, tender, and flavorful- we fought over the crispy burnt outside. ?It was the best meat I had here, and everything else was just OK. The pork belly was unflavorful (with the fat pieces, it tasted better) and the ribs were dry and not as moist as I would like. ?I didn't try the sausage, although I will try it next time. ?The pickles were fresh and the baked beans saucy, thick, and savory (in a BBQ-like sauce). ?My friend said not to even bother with the pulled pork. You buy the meat based on pounds, they pile it all on a tray, and you grab a seat at the long table. ?I think we had an off day and we got some bad cuts of meat. ?I'll be back for the beef brisket though.

Even as a vegetarian this place gets 5 stars just for the gallon beers they serve! ?We came for dinner on a Monday night so it was fairly quiet, we had walked past on Saturday night and it was packed. ?We walked straight in and joined the line to order food. ?The line was short and we got served in a few minutes. ?I ordered a couple of sides - broccoli salad, saurerkraut and potato salad. ?My husband ordered sausage, brisket and ribs. ?We got a seat outside, as inside was full, it was a little chilly but we didn't mind at all. ?The salads i had were really quite nice and they give you a couple of bread rolls each as well. ?This was enough for me. ?My hubby perhaps ordered enough to feed 2-3 people, but he did a pretty good job of getting through it. ?He said that the meat was delicous and he would for sure come back! ? The part that i loved was the beer. ?They have a pretty good beer selection and they pour it by the gallon. ?As an aussie i really didn't know how big a gallon was, i kinda thought it was a normal growler size. ?So i ordered a gallon of beer for the 2 of us. ?As i was carrying it back to the table, i realized how big it actually was - 4 litres. ?We did a pretty good job of finishing it off, but only got about 3/4 of the way through it and had to leave it. ? This would be the kind of place that would be awesome to come with a group of friends, share a couple of gallons of beer and for the meat eaters, eat some awesome BBQ.

Some BOMB bbq in Williamsburg at Fette Sau. ?I was skeptical, as I always am, when someone says: 'we're eating in Brooklyn'. ?*shudder* ? But I made the short trek through the L tunnel, and I'm glad I did. ?I had the Top Sirloin, Broccoli salad, and the Key Lime pie. ?Top that off with a large selection of draught beers and you have one happy Devin. ?The sirloin was delicious, with that smoky char outer edge, and the inner red tender meaty goodness. ?All said and done, it only put a $15 hole in my wallet. ?DELICIOUS AND AFFORDABLE. ?Seating is like cafeteria bench style and is first come-first serve. ?Also, a huge line will form on peak days and hours, BEWARE ?(but it's worth the wait).

Want some amazing bbq, awesome beer, and a selection of awe-inspiring bourbon? ?Well you've come to the right place!! ? This is the experience: ?you walk down an alley that is full of picnic tables with people gorging on their Fette Sau (warm weather only, duh), you get punched in the face by the magnificent aroma of the bbq, you walk into a warm open cafeteria full of long, dark wooden tables and benches, and wait in line (always, but worth the wait). ?I like to have someone wait in line, and the other person can go to the bar and get drinks...this may take awhile because they have a TON of great bourbon and beer. ?As you make your way up the line, your mouth will literally start to drool from the smells, the atmosphere, and seeing an entire room full of people chowing down on their bbq. ? Finally, you get close enough to the ordering counter and see the glorious meat! ?Hallelujah! ?Their ribs are awesome! ?Their beef brisket is so moist and tender, and perfectly seasoned! ?Their sausages are wonderful! ?Their veal cheeks are delectable. ?They rotate what they serve so check the chalkboard and see what they have. ?Don't think you know every cut of meat and just look at the window--look at the chalkboard because they often have some nice surprises each night. ? When you order, they'll put an aluminum half-sheet on a scale, rip some wax paper, and ask you what you want as they weigh it out: ?1/2 lbs of pulled pork, 1 rack of pork ribs, 1 lbs of beef brisket, 4 sausages, 1/4 lbs of pork belly, and a pint of beans, should do it, for me and my guest! ? One small note about the meat, on occasion, the meat has been a little fatty and greasy, but there are so many variables involved...in general, I've found their meat to be consistently superior! ? Their sides are what is really lacking. ?Their beans are good, pickles decent, but I would love to see some better sides here...That would really complete the meal for me. ? Sometimes, I get take-out and prepare my own sides...but usually, I exercise gluttony with a big G and PIG OUT, and then rub my belly very contently after a Fette Sau experience. ? Fun, delicious and enjoyable. ?Please enjoy!

Best BBQ in the NYC area. Being from Oklahoma and spending a lot of time with family in Memphis, I've been really disappointed in nearly all of NYC BBQ, but Fette Sau made me hopeful for the future of BBQ in NYC. ? We waited in a 1-1.5hr line but took turns getting cocktails in mason jars from the bar to pass the time. ?While in line, I met some fellow Oklahomans who now live in NYC and they also swear by Fette Sau. ?When I went to pay, the cashier was from where? ?Yes, Oklahoma. ?This seemed like more than luck, it was a trend. Being in good company, I was getting excited for the food ahead. We weren't disappointed. ? Get yourself some pork shoulder, brisket, beans and rolls. ?Add to that their delicious beer selection and cocktails and you're golden. ?There's a big wait but being able to get drinks while you wait and socialize with those around you makes it a better time. Looking forward to coming back soon!

We went to Fette Sau on a thursday night when we had an unsuccessful attempt on a Saturday night..I feel Fette Sau has earned such a strong reputation of being the best BBQ in the city that everyone is ready to wait to taste their BBQ. Nevertheless, we waited an hour+ to finally order. We got the pork belly, brisket, sausages, burnt ends baked beans and the potato salad. Everything we ordered was great! The pork belly was way too much fat, so if you're planning on tasting it, ensure that you get a little. We got soo excited with all the reviews about the pork belly that we got way too much. The brisket is really good and a must try. The sides are ok..The pickles are crisp and tasty.. They have a great selection of beers and whiskeys..try one of their tastings :) The food however is on the expensive side. Plan on spending around 25-30$ per person for a good serving of meat and sides. For the cost and not having to wait, I feel Hill Country is a great contender.

It's always an event to go to Billyburg. I'm sure most people in Brooklyn can attest to it, but it's pretty darn difficult to get to Billyburg (sans a car) if you live in Brooklyn and not near the L train. Thus, it's usually for a special reason I go. Fette Sau was suppose to be the special reason to go and overall I have to say it was a bit overrated. I just came back from eating at a BBQ place in Indianapolis ( a chain ?no less!) and I have to say some of the food there was better than the famed Fette Sau. ( Was I suppose to know Fette Sau means fat pig? Apparently I was super silly minus the '-illy' and add the 'tupid' if I didn't.) ? I almost missed seeing where Fette Sau was located - inconspicuously next to a small Bodega and a bunch of recycle bins with a chain fence outside. Not too shabby - it goes along with everything else around the area. There was quite a long line - I believe we as a group waited around 40-50 minutes to get our food. Seating is cafeteria style and unspoken rule seems to be no saving seats until you get your food. Oh and if you go: the menu for everything is by the side of the line where you wait and by the register - please take the time to read it and know what you want, not haggle with the guy behind the counter on what is good / not good to get. The whole place smells rootin' tootin' BBQ good. If only I could say the same for all the meats. Beef Brisket was oh so nicely charred black. The parts without lards of fat in it were actually quite delectable - juicy, meaty, tender - YUM. Sausage sucks. For what you pay per link - completely not worth it. Baked Beans had a awesome porky flavor to it - it was my favorite. Get this. ? Pulled Pork had a great taste to it - too bad it was really dry. The meats are well balanced by dinner rolls that were molestered by someone in our table who believed they were so plumply round. ( But I believe that's a whole different issue in itself.) ? They have a few sauces on the table - I wasn't quite sure which was which, but I did really enjoy the thick brown sauce. They have a side bar for drinks with a pretty interesting menu of beers on tap. (On the plus side, the actual tap handles are pretty cool looking since it consists of knives, cleavers and grinders you would see in a kitchen. How bad would it be if it fell off the handle?) Overall, I didn't think it was worth it to come here. Fun experience, but not really worth the trek in the long run. Overrated. They do have a really cute business card.

I'm just going to be blunt: Fette Sau is over hyped hipster BBQ. ?You should expect that when you come to Williamsburg for BBQ though. The cuts of meat and selection are interesting but leave a lot to be desired. ?The black angus beef was very tender and juicy but had NO FLAVOR AT ALL! ?The pork short ribs tasted like charred air! ?This is not what you want in your BBQ! Sauce? ?They don't recommend that you use sauce on their BBQ because of the dry rubs they use on their meat but they have sauces available at all the tables there (all of the sauces provided are ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THEM! I came here with my cousin and upon his trying of one of the sauces at the table he made this hideous face, spit out his food and exclaimed, "THIS TASTES LIKE MUD!" LOL!) Half ?the essence of good BBQ is sauce, there is no reinventing BBQ in 2012 people! Make a good sauce for your BBQ and cut out the pretentious hipster BS! The sides leave a lot to be desired as well. ?I had their beans and the sweet potatoes. ?The beans were not that bad but were missing something and the sweet potatoes were extremely bland and blah. On top of the not so great tasting BBQ, they have a flat screen TV in the dining area that plays a loop of a digital fireplace. ?Talk about hipster BS, this is the icing on the cake and makes this place more of a joke. The only positive thing that I can say about this place is that the staff is reasonably friendly unlike a lot of places in Brooklyn and the greater NY area. I can't recommend this place to anybody with confidence due to taste (lack there of) and price (too expensive for the lack of flavor), and believe me after hearing so many good things about this place I left disappointed. I can't speak to the craft beer and other selection of alcohol here as I didn't feel like drinking when I was there last night. I did see a few huge gallon jugs of beer at the tables and just from the look of them it looked like a party and I love beer but let's just say nobody comes here looking for the best beer and there are plenty of places that have great drinks.

Fitting name as you sure feel like a fat pig after eating here. Legit 'que in Brooklyn NY out of all places. Ever changing menu of the highest quality meats (all pork is Berkshire and they use Heritage beef). Prices are pricey and even though their setting as the feel of a picnic area, this ain't no grilling in your backyard kind of 'que. Berkshire pork spicy sausage links. Hell to the yes. The brisket was smokey, fatty, and meaty. A potato salad sans mayo? Gotta love the Germans for that. But the star here beside the bad ass cleavers and other meaty cutlery as beer taps, http://www.yelp.com/user ?was the burnt ends baked beans. A large side is $8 but worth it. There were huge, I mean huge chunks of meat in there. All saucy and delicious. All baked beans should be like this. Communal seating all around and folks don't mind you taking a drooling gander over at their tray of meaty eats. Shit got finger lickin real here.

Wow, Fette Sau. My cousin had been talking you up for a year before we finally made it. It was a chilly October night when we strolled in, ready to get fat. Half pound of brisket. Half pound of ribs. Half pound of sausage. Potato salad. Yeah, like I said. FAT. We gobbled. We drank beer from big ass glasses. It was unreal. I was sated until Christmas. I'm not sure if my cousin has eaten a full meal since, it was that good and that filling. We actually rolled home. Like end over end. Like we were on fire. Stop, drop, and drool, ahem, roll. I dream about Fette Sau, and I can't wait to go back. The only issue is that Fette is so effing good that people line up to eat it and the wait sucksss.

I'm torn like the snausage links they serve. (and yes, snausage) I used to savor the late night menu--links, pulled pork and baked beans on the cheap, just go home, pig out, watch basketball or talk to your doll collection. That was the ticket. But as I visited over time, the service got snarkier and snarkier. I'd ask to do a to-go order and it was the classic hipster, ughh I guess if I have to stop talking to my homies at the bar I'll assemble your order. I'm not even "Likes to complain about service" guy but when it keeps happening repeatedly you grow disdainful enough you decide not to return. Outside of that, the place is fine, I understand why folks take out-of-towners here, but I think there's more interesting stuff around. Waiting in line is lame, space fills up quickly, the meats are expensive and the menu gets limited as they run out. The dearth of NYC BBQ probably aids in the love here. But the difficulty in eating here and the someone peed in my mouthwash attitude turned me off long ago. If I was feeling forgiving or the hour was late-o-clock I'd venture a return based off all the yelp love.

I want you to picture in your mind the best BBQ meal you have ever had. ?Brisket, or pork, or ribs, or whatever it was. ?Imagine the small of it in your nostrils and the flavours in your mouth. Now go ahead and go to Fette Sau and tell me that it isn't better here. Holy shit, the food here is amazing. ?Three of us went here and we ordered enough food for 6 people but it was so good we barely noticed how much we overate. ?until we were done, but then we felt nothing but amazing because of it. The seating is communal inside, but that just gives you a good opportunity to meet new people as you enjoy the most delicious, and messy, meal you've had in ages. If I have a complaint it's that the lineup forms quickly. ?You can get around this by getting there early, but be warned there's lot of people who know this trick too. ? And if you're vegetarian or vegan, well, your loss. ?Seriously.

The best brisket I've had in an extremely long time. I could tell it would be awesome as I reached the home-stretch of my wait in line. The carver was taking things in and out of the hot case to slice for people's orders. When he pulled out the fatty beef brisket, and chucked it back in... it JIGGLED, just so. The jiggle of a piece of beef that is striated with enough fat to give it maximum flavor as it hits your mouth, yet not JUST fat. And the crust on the edge of the brisket... oh. my. Gawd. Believe me, I would take the L every day to hipsterville to have a taste of this - daily - if not for two things: the cost and the wait. The cost is something that is hard to avoid. Every brisket that exits the smoker is pretty much a work of art being parceled out to a couple dozen customers before a new one has to be brought out. But it definitely limits my desire to hit it every day.. which is probably a good thing because it's probably not health food by a long shot! The wait... now that can be avoided. Tourists and noobs clogging up the line have no idea how to order meat by the pound. I can't say I'm very experienced either, but I made sure to have my order ready by the time I reached the front of the line. I cannot say the same for the vast majority of other people in line. They were discussing amongst themselves what the appropriate amount of brisket to get was, whether they should get sides, "oh, what are the sides? do you have a menu?", etc. It was just disgraceful that the staff here let the line slow down to that degree. What happened to the no bullshit NYC attitude where if you're not ready to order when it's your turn, you get to wait for the next guy ahead of you to go? Seriously, they could do a lot better. They could require people to hand in an order form with their choices, then at the last minute they could instruct the carver to get the particular piece they want out of the hot case to fulfill their order with. They could also provide a standard sampler order that they multiply by the number of people in your party for a fixed price. That would be fine. Anything to force people to decide AHEAD OF TIME and not waste the time of the dozens of people behind them in line. Oh yes, make sure to get the BURNT ENDS BAKED BEANS too. It's all the pure carnal pleasure of the brisket, but only the crispy bits, submerged in delicious goopy baked beans. Finally, I have to recommend against their cheapo bottle of red table wine. It is just crap. Get beer instead or go for the next price level up on the wine. But all in all, I love, and need, Fette Sau in my life. Please don't change. I mean, please don't change anything other than your queueing system and your cruddy excuse for red wine.

I am now fat. Why I thought sharing 1.5 lbs of meat and two sides with just one other person was a good idea, I'll never know. But I do not regret it for a second. Been meaning to come here for about a year, since the first time I passed by it, but never had the time. Was finally able to block out a Friday night and got on line. It was early (7:30-ish), and the wait to get to the meat station was about half an hour. Sadly, they didn't have the pork belly that I hear so much about. Instead, we gorged on brisket, pork cheek, pulled pork, sausage, baked beans and broccoli salad. Let's start from top to bottom... 1) Brisket was amazing. So deliciously fatty and rich, but it basically melted in your mouth. Nothing else came close to it. 2) Pork cheek was pretty good. Crispy but not as flavorful as the brisket. 3) Pulled pork was probably the best I've ever had. The lady at the register asked if we wanted buns, and we said yes. She literally gave us 8 buns. So pulled pork + beans in a bun made for a very good pulled pork sandwich. 4) The sausage was pretty good, and worth it for $4 a link. It was of the spicy variety. 5) Baked beans were plentiful. Was too much for us to finish though, even for a small. 6) The broccoli salad (which my friend read about in Yelp reviews) was a bit disappointing. It was just stalks of broccoli in salad dressing. Not worth it. Other than that, I do have to echo the complaints of those who sat outside and were ogled by the jealous folks on line. By the time we sat down, the line was out the back fence. Some people were nice, asking for recommendations and curious about what we got. But others were just dicks. One dude remarked to his friend that we were greedy for getting so much food, loud enough for us to hear. Another guy literally pointed at our tray, like 6 inches away from our food. Wanted to fight that guy. Last note - first come, first serve seating does NOT mean you should be allowed to grab a table 10 minutes before you even order your food. Respect the system, jerks.

Can't say its the best BBQ I've ever had but its not bad. ?Hipster scene where you have to scour the room for a seat at communal picnic tables and then hope that your friends on line don't have to wait too long to get the food, or you might lose your spots. The briscuit is tender but a bit fatty for my taste. ? ?Good option for BBQ in Brooklyn if you don't mind the crowds.

Came here a few weeks ago with 3 people. We had pulled pork sliders, ribs, sauage, potato salad, scallopwed sweet potatoes, cole slaw, and pickles. Everything was yummy and we all said we'd come back here. Only minus is that the wait was pretty long. After waiting for food we had to wait for a table to open up so that 4 of us can sit down together. Either way it was worth it because the food was THAT good.

Really great BBQ, especially the boneless ribs. ?Reasonably priced (less than $30 bought 3 kinds of BBQ & a side, plenty for 2 people).

What can I possibly say about this place? It's incredible. The lines can be incredibly long. It's incredibly worth it. Have I mentioned that it's incredible? This is a place to bring three or four companions, at least. No matter what, you'll end up getting so much meat, and so much beer, it's simply impossible and ridiculous to bring only two. When you get in line, have someone scope out a table area. Send some one for an incredible growler of beer. I usually get darker stouts, as they usually have some great selections and the rotating taps typically give me something new and amazing to wash down the meaty goodness with. My absolute favorite are the beef ribs. They look like the come straight out of the Flintstones. But they're quite succulent. I haven't had the chance to try the pork belly. It's on my "To-Do" list. Incredible.

A great spot in Brooklyn, food is amazing if you are an individual who loves BBQ food. There is a line to get in but it's not too bad if you go with a group, have friend go in or yourself and buy a gallon of beer share among yourselves and by time you know it you'll be ordering and eating one of the finest BBQ foods you've had in you life.

Finally made the trek out to Fette Sau. Beware, this is Williamsburg so there are hipsters and transplants everywhere! 1. The line was crazy long and the fact that they operate out of a driveway/garage means there is no airflow. It was HOT. One of the guys in line in front of my group had sweat dripping down his neck. It was only 80 degrees out but damn, their set up made it feel 10x hotter. 2. Not everything is worth it. It may seem tempting to try everything they have but here's a tip. Skip the veggie sides and the baked beans, just go for the meat. Brisket, pork ribs and the spicy pork sausage are highly recommended. We also got the pulled pork which I found dry. 3. Communal seating/limited seating. Have someone in your party grab seats as you near the butchers counter.

The Good, The Bad & The Ugly: ?Starring Smoked Meat, Single Malt Whiskey & Hipsters The Good: Scent - The Smell of smoked goodness as you are walking down the driveway towards the door is intoxicating. ? Atmosphere - Reminiscient of a rednecks garage, less the Deliverence threats. Alcohol - Great selection of whiskey's and local brews. ?Eagle Rare, come to me! Meat - Up there with some of the best in NY...on the right day. ?Noteworthy items are the briskett and pork belly although the last time I was there the pork belly was very disappointing. ? Prices - Phenomenal value for your money. ?I'll take $25 for BBQ over $100 for Steaks any day of the week. ? The Bad: Side Selection - You are limited to beans, potato salad & pickles. ?Where's my Mac & Cheese?! Limited Stock - Running out of meat on crowded days. ?Not the worst thing knowing that they get their meat fresh daily. ?Sucks though when they are out of your favorite item. ? The Ugly: Scoffs - The jeers you get from hungry onlookers when eating your meal while they are waiting on line. Lack of tables - Don't come here with more than 4 people or else you will most likely have to wait for a table and/or split up. As in all storybook endings, good prevails over evil.

Another one I can't believe it took me so long to review. ?Ive been here far to many times to count. The other night I was set to meet a group of people, including one friend who loves to hate on this place, "its overpriced man, I can get the same stuff in Houston for...." ?Were not in Houston! ?That being the case, I can be reasonably comfortable in my declaration that this is still, and has been for some time, the best BBQ available in New York City. ?As a native New Yorker, I am fully aware that this is comparable to saying a place offers the best Pizza In most any other city, but still, I love the place for what it is. ? I really think a big part of the reason this place succeeds is that in many ways it doesn't ?try to replicate an authentic experience of eating at any specific traditional regional BBQ, and instead takes the foundations of those into new weird directions. ?I could be wrong (being a New Yorker and all), but don't think you traditionally find pork belly in most BBQ places out in America, whether it be Texas, the Carolinas or Kansas City. ?They have it here however, and you must get it, or whatever particular other belly they may be offering on that given night, lamb belly on one recent occasion, beef belly on the most recent, the preparations are always mind blowing. ?The stock menu stalwarts, pulled pork, brisket are both quite fine, but I usually recommend going with whatever special offering seems most unusual. ?The other night the straight out of the Flintstones on the bone beef short-rib wound up being the star of the night. ?One other time recently they smoked a whole lamb and sold of all of it cut by cut. ?How cool is that? ? ? ? ? ? The place is an ingenious money machine. ?You line up but can buy huge jugs of the beer, from the beautifully chosen rotating lists of taps, spending and consuming as you are on line to buy more! ?The converted garage setting is a Williamsburg at is annoyingly brilliant best. ?In the warm weather when the outdoor space in the front is in full force the lines can sprawl, out onto Metropolitan Ave. If you want whiskey they have like a million varieties and offer a bunch of flights. ?The are this place undoubtably falls short is the sides, its like they don't even try. ?I just get the broccoli salad and be done with it.

Can you say brisket? ?Ohhh my... by far the best brisket I have ever had. ?The ribs were great as well, as was the corn bread and beans. ?The atmosphere of Fette Sau cannot be beat either. ?With picnic tables outside for seating (which you have to get aggressive in getting seats at; totally worth it), growlers, plenty of paper towel rolls, in this old garage... its very low-key and fun in the best possible way. ?Don't be deterred by the long line that's always running out of the place -- definitely worth the wait for the food; just make sure one person in your party is scoping the scene and ready to pounce on open tables. Fette Sau lives up to its reputation as one of the best BBQ joints and restaurants in NYC.

This place deserves infinity stars!!!! If you are looking for real southern BBQ look no further. It is surprisingly hard to find good bbq in NYC, most places slice their Brisket thin and do not cook their meats with nearly the southern authenticity. I live in Manhattan and routinely take the subway out to Brooklyn for some amazing brisket. The burnt end baked beans are very good as well but the brisket is worth every penny. Long slow line at times makes for an almost antagonizing wait, especially with such delicious meat awaiting you! I travelled to Tennessee and Texas 2 years ago and have been searching NYC for similar awesome bbq and have yet to find one until i found Fette Sau. I cannot recommend this place more, it is just that good!

&%@#! There's not a damn thing about this place that I don't like -- maybe the lineups are long enough to make me hangry, but that's quickly taken care of by a drink from the bar, which thankfully is a separate lineup from the main course. ?If you're with pals, have one of 'em snag some empty seats as they clear up -- though, don't do it too early since you wanna let some of the folks ahead in line eat first. ?Expect to rub some elbows at the bench communal seating, but that's ok since everyone's just as happy to be there as you. Wicked selection of beers on tap, though they had a lone Warwick cider which wasn't too bad either, and a good variety of spirits if you want something stronger. ?Booze comes in half-pint or pint mason jars which add to the cuteness factor. ?Just don't overindulge before the main meal, since you wanna be sober enough for the awesomeness of this food. If it's your first time and you love pork, definitely try the pork belly, cheek, or jowl (all three?) - UNF. ?Cheek was a little on the burnt side, but the jowl was beautifully fatty and rich. ?There aren't enough words to talk about how amazing the beef brisket was -- all I can say is, it's a must. ?Love, love, LOVE the beans and you'll agree the post-bean consequences later are worth it. ?The German-style potato salad was a great soothing alternative to the spicy bbq sauces -- perfectly salty, peppery, oily, tart on the tongue. They have desserts too, but if you make it that far, kudos to you. ?They should have a book devoted solely to photographs of people stumbling, rolling, or lurching out of Fette Sau after a great meal here.

My new favorite BBQ place. This place makes Dinosaur BBQ look like a vegan luncheonette Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 2:30pm. ?Now fette usually opens at noon but as soon as we arrived a sign in front informed us that today they would be opening at 3:30pm No biggie, ended up hopping across the street to Spuyten Duyvil which has some excellent IPA's on tap. Trying very hard not to fill up on beer we wandered over just before 3:30-Yay! they're open....and oh look already a line. You guys weren't kidding about the line but honestly it moved pretty quickly for us. Now I had been looking forward to coming to fette sau for quite some time so I made sure to do my yelp research on meat choices, portion sizes, and perusing the photo gallery since this isn't your typical BBQ place. For my friend and I wanting to experience as much of fette sau as possible, we settled on 1/4 lb pulled pork shoulder, 1/4 lb pork belly bacon, 1 sausage link, 1/4 lb beef brisket, and 1/2 lb beef rib, small baked beans, and small potato salad. It was a lot of food and we did a pretty good job demolishing it. A little bit of the rib was left and some of the sides but overall I was extremely satisfied with our accomplishment. I don't know if it was because I was super hungry and I started with the pulled pork or what but goddamn that had to be the best pulled pork I've ever had. I torn open my potatoe roll (they gave us four complimentary) stuffed it with pulled pork and soaked it with the table BBQ sauce. Hot damn was I in heaven. Seriously I am writing this hours later and want to go back for some more. ?The meat was super tender and that BBQ SAUCE. ?F-me standing, that stuff was slathered over the rest of the meat tray and it was finger lickin good. Staff was really friendly, decent prices, I shall be returning.

Beer by the gallon. Should I even continue this review? Everyone else has commented on the length of the lines; I don't need to then. When it comes to pork Berkshire any part is going to be amazing no matter how you cook it. It's all the fat in that line. Yum. Unless I missed it, I have yet to see a review of the Pastrami. Here we go: it's fucking nirvana. Seriously I would come here just for this. I killed an entire pound of it. Sampled some of the brisket and ribs and both were quite good. Nice amount of smoke and juiciness. No mac-n-cheese or greens? WTF!?!?! But won't knock the pickles and sauerkraut.

Oh Fette Sau... Your constant crowdedness and long lines have intimidated me, and your location all the way across the Wburg bridge has deterred me from getting my ass over to you for so long. Now that I have finally tasted some of your sweet, sweet BBQ, I can honestly say that all of my newfound love for you completely overcomes all of the previous fear and doubt I have had. I promise to never stay stray too far from you ever again. Four of us came here on a beautiful Sunday afternoon just before 6pm, to a surprisingly short line. However about 15 minutes after we stepped in line, the place somehow almost miraculously filled up quickly and tables became difficult to come by. It seems that you really have to come here early, before the dinner rush, in order to not only get a table but also score some tasty meat because when they run out, they run out. They were already out of the oh so popular pork belly when we got there. Between the four of us, we got about a pound of pulled pork, beef brisket, 4 spicy Berkshire pork sausages, Gus's pickles, and burnt ends baked beans, along with their fluffy sweet dinner rolls. The beef brisket was particular fatty that day, which was good and bad because the fattiness obviously ensured that the brisket would be moist; however us two girls aren't exactly fond of beef fat. The spicy sausage was surprisingly the standout meat of the day, the casing had a great snap, giving way to perfectly fatty, smokey and spicy pork. God I love sausage!* The pulled pork was very good and quite lean, which tasted totally awesome doused in either one of the two BBQ sauces (one is sweeter and the other smokier and sightly spicy) on their tables. The baked beans with burnt ends was surprisingly good as well, full of smokey meatiness all bathing in this thick, sweet BBQ sauce. While I have yet to try every single BBQ joint in NYC, I think that Fette Sau is possibly one of the best BBQ restaurants not only in Brooklyn but also in all of NYC. I love the laid back atmosphere, full bar stocked with beers on tap (available by the gallons, btw), whiskey and even wines, and the long communal tables. It's also great that you can order anything you want and pay by the pound, which makes the experience totally customizable and 100% awesome. -- *That's what she said! [C'mon guys, get your minds outta the gutter!]

Oh em gee. I already made a date to go back here. I've heard so much about this place, and I can't believe it took me this long to finally go! We went on a Tuesday night at around 6:30 pm, no lines whatsoever. We ordered a pound of the boneless beef bbq ribs and the pulled pork shoulder. We also ordered a side of the potato salad. The meat just melted in my mouth. All this fatty goodness with the charred and smoky flavor was absolute heaven. The sauces on the tables were good, but unnecessary. They also have a great beer selection! AMAZING.

I read about this place in an airline travel magazine, specifically for their pork belly. I've wanted to try it for 2 years, but didn't get around to it till now. Went here twice with several people. The place definitely lives up to its reputation. The pork belly was incredible...absolutely the best I've ever tried. So perfectly seasoned and tender, moist. I would call that perfection. The other noteworthy item was the beef brisket. However, it tasted a lot better and was much more tender the first time around. The second time I came here, it was a lot chewier, and didn't meet the expectations set by the first trip. Knocking them down one star for the lack of consistency in quality. But overall it was still damn delicious! And so was everything else (pulled pork, ribs, roast pig, boneless beef, baked beans). Awesome selection of local beers, too. Though they were out of the Kelso brown nut ale when we were there, which is a bit disappointing.

Being a big barbecue fan, I travel far and wide to any bbq place in the 5 boroughs, yet I always wind up going back to Fette Sau. ?Their meat is always good. You can count on them to always have the usual meats and to not run out of the pulled pork/brisket that half the other places can't seem to correctly portion out and they meat is always nice and juicy. The only real con for me here is the wait. One small counter that takes over 2 minutes a customer making ridiculously long waits on weekend nights.

There are meats and sides here that are definitely worth 5 stars, like the ribs, the brisket, some of the sausage, the beans, and the potato salad. My experience with the lamb shank was very disappointing. It was really tough, not a lot of meat, and pretty pricey. Even if you decide you aren't going to order "a lot," you still easily spend over $40. It just doesn't seem that worth it to me. It is a great place, great location, you can definitely get your meat fix here, the meat is labeled organic/grass fed, so I would recommend this place to a diehard carnivore. Or maybe not, because some of the meat items are a bit disappointing. Also, I'm not a big fan of the bread they give you. It's just filler food, to sop up whatever sauce you poured over your tray.

Better than Texas, forget being best in NYC. Never had pork belly that tasted that good, no matter how it was prepared. Pork cheeks that remind you of Christmas dinner. Baked beans with more pork in them than beans. Good ribs, they were dry, but add BBQ sauce, then climax. Brisket was insane, falls apart into shredded splinters of smokey meat so good you can't stop eating it. Pulled pork served dry, but no matter, add that sweet BBQ sauce...mission accomplished. Potato rolls taste like they are already buttered. I am going to reverse engineer the broccoli too for home use applications. Cold beer. Price doesn't make you want to call a grief counselor. Just go.

A wise man (Homer Simpson) once said, "You don't win friends with salad, where's the meat?!" Boy, do the crew at Fette Sau take this thought to heart. If you fancy yourself a meatitarian, consider this Brooklyn mainstay your happy place. Upon walking into Fette Sau, you're hit with a case of the meat sweats before even dipping a single forkful of pork belly or brisket into your face hole. A vegan's nightmare to say the least. I've yet to try a fleshy varietal that I didn't enjoy, but it's really hard for me to wrap my head around the absurdly high prices and the hour plus wait for a tray of charred meats. When I think BBQ, I think inexpensive grocery store runs and backyards in Texas... not $45 for an for a small sinful indulgence. I suppose it's New York and not a landlocked destination in the Heartland, but really... it just doesn't add up to me. Despite the massive price tag, it's still one of the best BBQ joints in town, and given the weather cooperates, it's just about the best hang in all of NY for a lazy weekend day with sunshine and a gaggle of great friends. Pair the grub with one of the many hard-to-find whiskeys and bourbons that dot their bar menu, and you've got an afternoon that'd get the seal of approval from any high flying NRA executive west of Poughkeepsie.

Pros: Great selection of beer, great meat! Cons: Long wait, unimpressive side dish, and it's awkward eating with people staring at u gorging on ur meat I went there around 6 pm and the line was not long at all. Only had about 5-7 people waiting before us. While some of my party were lining up, went to the bar and grabbed some beer and their mug ?is so cute! (Basically jam jar without the lid.) Anyways, we ordered the pulled pork, pork ribs, black angus ribs, pork belly, broccoli salad, potato salad, 3 corn cobs, and a bag of potato chips. My favorite is their black angus ribs and pork belly!!!! :D First of all, black angus ribs just melt in ur mouth! Just the right amount of rub on the outside and seasoned and cooked to perfection. And PORK BELLY! Wells, half of it is fat, but when u order pork belly, u know what ur getting. The pork belly was so oily, greasy, and fatty to the max but nom nom nom, loved every bite of it! (Order broccoli salad with this. Trust me, u will need it. lol) As for the seatings, I don't mind communal seatings, but since the line forms next to your table, people tend to stare at you eating ur food. Either u feel awkward or proud that u got ur meat before them! :) Would I go back here? Hell yeah~! But I will get there either really early or late to beat the crowd...

Come here with an empty stomach. Wait in line for at least 20 minutes, but I came here on a tuesday at 5, line was short (10 min). Pick your meat, they do it by the scale, everyday they have something the other days in the week. Find a seat, first come first served. ?Sanitize your hands and eat like an animal. Pork belly, ribs, sausages, dfkgsdfgsd...nothing tastes bad here. ?Just go for everything and eat it! ?Make your stomach happy for once..

My favorite place for bbq hands D! Go with a group so you can order everything on their menu so you can try it all, that's what we did. Brisket was amazing due to the fat/meat distribution. Sausage had great flavor and snap, and their ribs were excellent as well. Didn't dig the sides all too much. Also if you have 4 people and two are girls that don't drink too much, don't go for the gallon of beer. It's too much. That's almost 4 liters, you combine that with their entire menu and you'll start growing a food baby. I literally couldn't move for the next 3 hours.

Hey you Fat Pig(Fette SAU)....want some yum yum? Me too that's why I checked out this trendy spot.... First thing is first, this is not a first date spot as I tried to make it , unless your first date is super cool....then maybe this can work. Second the Grubb comes by the pound. What better way to have BBQ? Pulled Pork, Pork Belly, Ribs....you know all the mainstays with all the appropriate flavors, smoking, and texture. The thing that is awesome in this spot is their Whiskey Flights.....what better way to prove your manhood than to eat some pig and wash it down with Whiskey! Seats are limited and styled like park benches, so expect a lil upclose and personal with total strangers. Other than that this place is pretty dope , especially for BBQ IN NYC

To best enjoy Fette Sau, it's smart to study history. ?In particular, the invasion of Normandy in World War II. First of all, assemble a coalition of allies - at least 6 to 12 people. ?Then split this group into divisions, each with its own unique mission. When launching the assault, team Omaha should get in line. ?You need a steady, stoic on line presence as the wait will be upwards of an hour when busy. ?Those with patient personalities (not the foot-stomping angst-ridden, slap a soldier Patton types) are best suited for this task. ? A second group, Utah, should land on a table and secure a beachhead upon the benches. ?They need not try and hold an entire area - but enough space to land supplies and expand the footprint once that the food drop is imminent. ? A third group, called Easy Company, should also be sent in to maneuver within the restaurant, performing various tasks. ?Example: - procure beer for the bench warmers and line waiters - spell others needing bathroom breaks - gather needed supplies such as paper towels, toothpicks and cutlery - scout & then provide intelligence reports as to what's on the menu. ? Of course you can try other approaches (to your own peril). ?I observed small groups and couples on dates neglect the above strategies only to find themselves without a place to sit or a whistle that was not sufficiently wet. ?Do not get stuck without a beachhead or you will get overrun by plaid wearing ironically bearded panzer hipsters. Only a combined multi-faceted assault by overwhelming forces will best ensure the odds for victory. ?Finally, once team Omaha is landed at the counter and ready to order, have everyone throw in cash and simply get a giant platter of everything. Then you can feast on the spoils of war.

Oh Fette Sau. Thank you for every single mouth-watering juicy bite of barbecued rib, brisket, pulled pork, and cole slaw. My stomach is grumbling as I type this. The space is cool and the vibe is laid back. Good selection of relevant brews and libations. 5-star barbecue in Williamsburg.

Fascinating decor here. Definitely fits in with the hipster vibe of Williamsburg. On the downside, you have to wait in a long line oftentimes, which is hard to do when the aroma of the delicious barbecued meats is hitting you in the face. On the upside....everything else. Casual and laid back atmosphere with some of the best barbecue you will find in the city. I was under the weather when I came here, but I was still able to get a few slices of their famous pork belly. Let me tell you, sick or not, it was delicious! As a pork belly connoisseur, I was more than satisfied. It even came with a couple of soft rolls. Next time, when I'm healthy, I intend to sample a lot more of the short and concise menu. *On a side note, I wish they offered hot beverages such as coffee or tea. I was hoping for something that would soothe my throat, although I know it's a hipster restaurant/bar, so I wasn't surprised they didn't have any. I just think it wouldn't hurt.

Came in for dinner on a rainy day, so the dining room was packed. ?I loved the idea of walking up to the meat counter to order your meat and having it all served on cafeteria trays. ?I also loved sitting on benches, sharing sauces, and everything else. ?It almost made me feel that I was at an actual BBQ. The service was great and I loved their beans and BBQ sauces, but I didn't quite care for the meat as I thought I would. ?Maybe it's because it was hyped up so much or maybe I came on an off day? ?But a lot of my meat tasted like wood, the texture was great, just not the taste and I ended up trying to mask it with their yummy sauces ... and I'm not a fan of pickles being more like cucumbers. =\ I am definitely going to be giving this place another try since I refuse to believe that what I had that night was what everyone's been raving about.

Inside, outside... line I can easily grow facial hair on. ? It smelt like good bbq, I was excited for brisket. ?that line made me want to hurt myself. ?Even with a down pour people were sitting outside eating i couldn't help but think they were mild ReRe's I dont care how good the food is im not getting wet as hell for it, these people even had their food getting wet. So we got off line and decided to look for a bar to get a beer and we would come back closer to time. We found nothing, and about ten mins later we grabbed a few beers and waited the line out. ?The people that we behind us before we left about 20mins later were about 2 feet closer to eating. ?Thats f*ckin silly....No seriously. Not the "Hey look this guy has straws in his mouth pretending to be a walrus silly" "But if they dont get their shit together im breaking out my 22 on a school roof and going ape shit on someone silly" Too far? Perhaps, but lines like that drive me insane...... The place itself feels like your eating in a garage, its not horrible but I watched were they kept the dry goods and I did not envy anyone who worked there. When we actually got the food after making sean stand on lines for what felt like years it was good. Not slap you're momma good. But good. ?We shared everything. ?The brisket was nice but I love my brisket smokier, I did really enjoy the pork butt and the beans were surprisingly good. Worth the wait on that line, Na...... There has to be a better system for this place, they must lose a lot of business this way.

Of course I was expecting to experience serious foodgasm here, so I was slightly let down when my food didn't even make me horny...but it may have turned me on a little. The wait: The eight of us waited about 35 minutes to get our food at around 8pm on a Monday. Of course getting a table together wasn't an option...luckily I live just a block away and have a courtyard so we were able to bring our food here. Broccoli salad: I liked it! However, I wish they had cooked it longer so it was less hard. It's pretty spicy too, if you're into that...and this is probably the only dish on the menu that will NOT make your body hate you for consuming it. Pulled Pork: Tasty, but I thought it was a little too flavorful. Pork Belly: Yummy as expected, but I really liked the pulled pork more! Buns: I'm glad they give you buns but I wish they were bigger...it's not big enough to make a diesel pulled pork sandwich! Corn Bread: They got none. What's up with that? How could they not have corn bread?

I've been meaning to try out this place for quite sometime. I was in the area so decided to stop by for a 'snack.' There's a long entrance to the door.. seems sorta like a red carpet to the pearly gates of heaven. Ok, I kid but it could come close. This place has the cool rustic vibe that Brooklyn does so well. Lined with wooden walls and floors along with the picnic tables creates a cool atmosphere! Now onto the food! Got the beef brisket, pork cheek, beans, and pickles! The brisket was by far the tenderest moist juicy meat I've had! The pork cheek was a bit too cooked and more a chewy texture. Not a huge fan of the beans, seemed like they were cooked too long. I wish I had gotten more of it! I will be back to try the other beautiful meats very soon! Tip: get there around 5:30 or earlier or else u will be waiting for hours!

Ah Fette Sau, you fill my house with the smell of BBQ all year round, and I just can't hate you for it. Sometimes the lines can get absolutely out of control, to the point where it might start to hurt your experience. Luckily it's in such an amazing location that if the line looks too daunting, there's no shortage of incredible places to check out. This is for sure the best BBQ I've had in Williamsburg, I haven't had enough in Brooklyn and NYC in general to say much more than that, but I'm working on it. Everything I've ever had at Fette Sau was top-notch, and they have a fantastic whiskey selection to boot. It's a bit pricey, but when you want some quality BBQ, this is the place.

Vegetarians need not attend! My old chef buddy from Tampa (now local Brooklyn-ite) was telling about this place Fette Sau. He was saying it was the holy grail of BBQ. Being from the south, I assumed he was mistaken. ...later that day, grease was all over my face and hands. The meat is sold by weight and served on half sheet pans. The beers are served in mason jars and they make their own pickles. This place is the realnesss. If you don't know what "bark" is you must teach yourself. They perfectly execute their craft here. If I cant own a grill or smoker up here I let them do it for me. They also supply at least six different sauces on the tables for your enjoyment. So tasty!! TIP: They open at 5 on weekdays, be there at 4:55 so you get a seat at a table. They sell out of food and quickly become standing room only. I always bring guests in for a bite and ALWAYS bring myself here when I hit Brooklyn.

Cold barbeque. There is no excuse for serving cold barbeque at a barbeque restaurant. However, I'm sure their brisket and duck would taste great warm. The pork belly tasted like a pork rib you would get at a mediocre chain barbeque place, only with tasteless fat attached (which should have been the good part). Their vintage Holstein sirloin had an unpleasant cinnamon taste. You'd think they were going to grind it up and put it in a meat patty to be sold in one of those street carts. Their beans tasted like burnt sauce. At least they were warm. The sausage link was ok. I just wish they had eased up on the fennel. All the meat looks so good you almost instinctively want to say it tastes great. I really wanted to like this place, but it will be hard to give them a second chance.

I had my eye on this place for a year and didn't check it out until this past Saturday. I would say this place is a 3.5, but I guess I'll round up compared to other BBQ places I've been to in the city and because of it's setup/ambiance. I had the beef brisket, which is prob the best brisket I've had in the city. I also had the pulled pork, which turned out to be a bit dry. Luckily they have sauces at the tables. The sauces are kind of tangy. I also had the broccoli salad as a side, which was really refreshing on a warm sunny day and was a good break in between mouthfuls of BBQ. They also leave on the stems and it was a little crunchy too, which I liked. The line wasn't too long since I went after lunch hours, like 2:30. How it works: You line up to order your food. You order by the pound, most things are around $18/lb. 1 lb + 1 side is pretty good for 2 people. You can pick up paper plates, silverware and wet naps when you pay. You also order drinks at the register. It's easier to have one person find a table and another order the food and drinks. The tables are communal and each table has a roll of paper towels and two containers of sauce. The restaurant is pretty good w/ making sure the paper towels are replaced because BBQ does get messy. Once you're done, you can just get up and leave. I'd def like to come back here and try the other things on the menu. The other things in the window looked amazing!

My meals are usually vegetable heavy, but I deviate from this when the meat is as good as it is at Fette Sau. For the love of food, please order the pork belly, pulled pork shoulder, and the ribs. Off of friend's plates, I've sampled all of the other meats on the menu and they have all been PERFECT, with the exception of the brisket. I may have gotten a bad piece, but it was literally all fat and I couldn't even eat it. The baked beans are to-die-for. You have to eat them. Same with the pickles. Yum! The broccoli was awesome the first time, but the second time I came back it was actually swimming in olive oil. I love olive oil, but it was just too much. I ended up actually using my bread to soak the oil out of the broccoli in order to render it edible. I'm taking one star away for the wait, although it's really not that bad if you have a good beer/cocktail and a bunch of friends. It just sort of sucked in the cold winter waiting in line outside.

This place is an epic meat-whiskey fest! Do not fear the inevitable line, if it helps, grab yourself a whiskey drink from the loaded bar and wait patiently. All of the meat is on display behind the counter of which you order, which is dangerous because we wanted to eat everything and did. ?Your feast is served on a half-sheet pan with awesome rolls. ?Do not forget the sides, specifically the baked beans which are loaded with pork..I wish that I could remember everything we ate but I can't, I do however remember having my blown ? Back to the whiskey though, the bar is stocked with tons of ?whiskey, most of which I had never heard of, forcing me out of my Jameson shell, totally okay though, discovered that Whistlepig is great too. ?I felt like a total man after leaving this place, full of meat and whiskey, great meal will definitely return.

There's a hierarchy of BBQ joints in Williamsburg. If you're looking for all-American style cheap and quick canteen-style BBQ, head to Mable's Smokehouse. If you want quality BBQ, head to Fette Sau - if you're prepared to brave the lines. Fette Sau is modestly sign posted - a small neon-lit sign hangs above the long front entrance, where you'll probably see the back end of a long line. Expect to wait up to an hour in the summer to get served, but boy is it worth it. Like Mable's, Fette Sau doesn't serve chicken, but they have a decent collection of sausages, pulled porks, ribs and beef brisket. I love the BBQ beans. They're smoky, wholesome and tantalizing - much better than Mable's. Love the pickles and potato salad too. The potato bread is also worth a mention - always good with the pulled pork. The downside - we ordered the beef brisket once and this was too fatty for my liking. There's no customer service - you're expected to seat yourself (when there's room!) and clear up after yourselves too. The overpowering 'smoky' smell might appear inviting in the winter, but when it's super hot outside, it's probably the last place you want to be - cooped up inside!

This was the best barbecue I've had outside of Central Texas, and I'm so, so glad I made the "trek" to Williamsburg. The hour-long wait was torture, especially with the smell of juicy barbecue in the air, but so worth it. Fette Sau is in a former auto repair shop with long communal tables in the main room and then more tables outside in the front. It's dark, dingy, and overrun with men with handlebar mustaches. You can drink while you wait, as there is a bar that serves beer in mason jars. Good to have a friend scout for a table while you wait in line. Hover shamelessly; everyone's doing it. Simple sides like baked beans, German potato salad and broccoli salad are solid but obviously not the main attractions. I really wish they had creamed corn, but at least the baked beans were terrific. As for the meats, I was crazy about the brisket and pork belly. So freaking tender. Their signature sauce goes well with everything. I also LOVED the rolls--so buttery and soft, if only they were unlimited. Root beer to wash it all down. I split all of this with a friend, and it set us back $50. It was plenty of food and we had some leftovers, but it was still pretty pricey. BBQ lovers, add this to your bucket list.

Great on food but lousy and non existent on customer service. ?The management should not allow people to occupy the seating area while the other people in their party get the food. ?Seating space is limited and when someone holds the table it effectively doubles the time the seats are occupied. ?this one ?time I was their I was told not to sit here because their friends were on line and right by the front. ?I sat nearby and by the time I finished they still weren't joined by the rest of their party. ?I knocked off 1 star for that and I blame management. Last night was even worse. ?I have never tried beef belly before and it was on the menu. ?I asked to have a taste and was told "we don't give free samples" ?I said then weigh it I don't need it for free I just need to know what it taste like. ?He said I can sell you a quarter pound. ?If I don't like it would you take it back and he replied NO. ?I had purchase over $100 for 2 people and felt like leaving it and walking but it was after nine and my son was hungry. ?If you don't mind the, "we don't give a shit attitude about you because we make money" then go their. ?Last night was forty degrees and people were eating outside. Hey how 'bout tenting the area so the people and food stay warm. ?Oh yeah that cost money and your don't ever spend on the customer benefit. ? I should have knocked off three stars but I'm a little more benevolent then they are. They'll never see me again and you shouldn't go their either. ?There are a lot of restaurants that do a lot better for the customer

I got off the train from Boston at 7:30 on Thursday and was standing in line waiting for tasty BBQ by 8:40, with cider in a pint glass. Awesome. Seating is communal, the line for food is long, and I liked everything that I tried (to varying degrees, of course). Pork ribs: nice dry rub, tender meat. Pulled pork: juicy, good flavor. Broccoli salad: I know this is probably heresy, but this might've been my favorite thing I had from this place. Perfectly cooked and dressed broccoli. Half-sour pickles: crisp, juicy, very well seasoned. Baked beans: not as meaty as I'd hoped, the beans felt slightly undercooked to me. Rolls: come with the meal, I certainly wouldn't ask for extra. Basic large, flavorless, rolls. Drinks: tried the cider, which was good but a little sweeter than I typically enjoyed, and then had the Bourbon mule was I surprisingly liked (surprising only because I'm not a bourbon person, but I'm a sucker for ginger beer). Communal seating was fine and everyone was cognizant of not lingering overlong as people were constantly needing seats. The BBQ sauces on the table were mostly good; I liked the North Carolina style, the other two were typical sweet or hot.

I'm going to preface this by saying that i was blitz'd out of my mind when i went to eat here. ?I had just come from a Yelp wine tasting event and when i got on the 2 hour line, my buddies ordered a LOT of whiskey and beer and we were drinking that online. ?Also i had, what they call on How I Met Your Mother, some sandwiches. ?Needless to say the memory is a little fuzzy. They ran out of the pork belly when we got to the front of the line so we ordered about 5 pounds of briskets (remember, we all had...sandwiches). ?The briskets was absolutely delicious. ?I dont quite remember what it tasted like but i do remember eating about 2 pounds by myself. ?I also remembering taking a piece of the brisket, using it like a scoop for the beans and just threw that in my mouth. ?Good times. I will definitely go back here so I can write a better review intricately describing the what the brisket (and the pork belly) tastes like (I'm guessing it tastes like christmas). Happy eating, suckers.

Best BBQ BOO YA! FETTE SAU = Fat Pig I love BBQ and travel the usa ?and for the year its my favorite. I cant even understand how someone would post a bad review. The food is excellent. It is expensive and it is a pain because the line is long. But thats because its that good. If you dont want to wait get there early - way early otherwise grab a ball jar drink or two and start talking up your fellow on-liners because they are become friends by the time you get to order. Awesome pulled pork, great duck, brisket you name it you cant go wrong. This guys knows how to make BBQ and its the best problems being they run outta stuff so if you get there when there outta stuff your outta luck! ?Again its the best of NY

BBQ BLISS!! ?I consider myself a barbecue Gourmand of sorts, I seek the stuff out all over the nation. I've been to City Market in Lulling Texas, Oklahoma Joe's in Kansas City, Blue Smoke in Manhatten, Patsy's Ribs in St. Louis and other BBQ institutions. Although being a native New Yorker may give me a slight bias, the old addage, "If you can make it there, you'll make it anywhere" is generally the truth. New York has the best food in the World and now BBQ is no exception. This experience was on par with any BBQ encounter I've ever had. It helps when you can buy growlers of quality microbrews while waiting on a line that stretches over the Verrezano Bridge. They display the meats of the day on a chalkboard and you roll up to the counter in about an hours time to greet your game. I sampled the ribs $22 per pound, the pulled pork $18 per pound, the Pastrami $25 per pound, the briskett 18$ per pound and the sausage links. There are also several sides to choose from and they give you some small potato rolls to make sandwiches. The two sauces on the table were excellent. I will take them in order. The ribs were fantastic and in some ways exceeded the quality of Pappy's in St. Louis because the rub doesn't stay you for two days. The pulled pork was very good, possibly great but not overly moist. The sausage links were stellar, crisp bite like a pickle and bursting with flavor. The brisket had a nice peppery kick to it but in my opinion was overcooked. The Pastrami was rubbery and should be removed from the menu. You are within five miles of the best Pastrami in the planet, stick to Katz deli. The food is sent out on paper like in Texas and the whole experience is entirely uplifting. Don't visit New York without a trip here. This place has serious moxie.

Came here on a Friday night, waited in line for a little over an hour. Come here with at least 4 people. It isn't worth it if you're alone or just a two-some. The beer selection was good and I like that they have those massive gallon jugs of beer. We ordered brisket, pork ribs, beef ribs, potato salad, broccoli stuff, and sausage. When we finally got our food, I went into eat mode and only stopped to take a breath once in a while. It wasn't possible for anyone to communicate with me or vice versa for that 15 - 20 minutes of food shovelin' goodness. It's that kind of place. One thing I will warn though, the ribs aren't the fall off the bone kind. They are cooked a different way, and I personally like them, but there were complaints of the tougher texture from my group. They still tasted amazing. Definitely try the beef ribs and the potato salad. The bread was meh. The one shitty thing about this place is the seating system. It's nerve wracking to wonder where you're going to sit and it's hard to save a seat for a large group especially when other people are walking around with large trays of food and waiting to sit down. We didn't end up having trouble finding a seat, but the possibility does exist.

Not much to say that hasn't been said. I'll add that they have a bunch of Manhattan Special sodas that I don't think I've seen anywhere else. Gassosa (lemon/lime), Orange, Sarsaparilla. I can't remember if they have the Cherry or Vanilla, but I think they may. I didn't even realize Manhattan Special made anything but those Espresso sodas until I saw these others at Fette Sau.

Did you just call me Fat Sow? This is the worst food hangover I've had in awhile. After waiting in line for about an hour, downing about 2 growlers amongst 3 people, we finally ordered pulled pork, brisket, spicy sausage, gigantor dinosaur short ribs, pork ribs, pork belly, oh and of course sides of chili baked beans, german potato salad and broccoli... AND another gallon growler. The brisket was unfortunately slightly dry, but I just ignored it and devoured the amazing fall off the bone ribs and snappy spicy sausage and succulent pork belly. Though my companions in gluttony loved the sides, they were kinda an afterthought to me. Needed to save room in my bellay for as much smoked meats as possible. Ya, the line was long, but it kind of adds to the experience and anticipation. I enjoyed the beer and the smells while hanging out in line, and the wait only heightened my food excitement. I was not disappointed at all.

MEAT!! That is what you get here. Here's what we got: -brisket: moist and tender; my fave -large side of baked beans: delicious! I would just get this instead of a separate order of the Berkshire belly as there are bunches of the pulled meat in this dish -sausages: -Berkshire belly (bacon): dry -hand-pulled Berkshire belly: oily but delicious Everything was good, but some of the meat was more tender and moist than others. We also got some bread and pickles. We were not able to finish all of it so we asked for some bags and took the rest home. I especially loved the bar area. The tiles on the wall and knives as handles for the beers on tap. Very cool. The place is communal seating and there's plenty of paper towels and wet wipes for you.

After sightseeing through Brooklyn/Manhattan on a bike tour and hitting up the Brooklyn Brewery, my husband and I wanted to find some local cuisine to satisfy our dinner. It was about 7:30 and we settled on Fette Sau, a BBQ place, very reminiscent of our favorite St. Louis place, Pappy's. One important distinction is that they have a bar here! While we waited in line outside (for 2.5 hours!) we sampled some tasty booze. Liquor on an empty stomach? This place has it figured out. By the time we got our food, we were so hungry and buzzed that I couldn't even tell you if it was that good! That's a little bit of a lie, though. We had the pulled pork, mac n cheese, and baked beans, and I think I probably ate faster than I have ever eaten in my life. It was amazing, but I'm having trouble remembering if it was because the food itself was so good, or I was just that starving. No matter, it was a fun experience and made me love Brooklyn that much more. I guess the fact that we waited for our food for 2.5 hours and I still gave it 4 stars should tell you something.

I don't know how you can give four stars to a place that makes you wait in line to pay good money to eat. Who is doing who a favor here? ?I don't think any barbecue or restaurant deserves accolades if you have to stand inline like sheep to have one of the preoccupied counter people deign to serve you. I walked out and went down the block. Maybe it's good, I'll never know. Perhaps the deluded think differently.

Like others have said, I have wanted to try this place for three years. ?Being that I live in Jerz and am always in the city, BK has always been kinda out of the way. ?However, an opportunity presented itself that landed us in Brooklyn and this was tops on our list. First, they open at 5 during the week, so note the hours of operation. ?I forgot this and we had to kill about an hour plus cuz we got there early. ?Second, know that the menu changes on a daily basis, so what you may come for may not be offered on a given day, unless there is a rotation that I am unaware of. Now for the food. ?We ordered the brisket, pulled pork, pork cheeks, pork chops, beans, and broccoli salad. ?The brisket, OH MAN THE BRISKET!! ?Must say this is close to the best brisket I've had. ?It was extremely tender and really rich in flavor. ?The BBQ sauce is fantastic, but not necessary since the brisket had so much flavor. ?The pulled pork was equally good and great with the complimentary rolls. ?The pork cheeks were a great added bonus. ?I think I read a few reviews saying that they were not great, but these were the second best part of the meal. ?Luckily the meat man highly recommended them and we obliged!! ?The chops were good, but fourth on the list with the other heavy hitters. ?The beans were good and really filling. ?The broccoli salad was good. ?It was steamed then served cold. ? All in all, a great visit and definately be back. ?only thing is that the food is so rich and filling, don't be afraid to take some home. ?We didn't order too much, but it was SUPER GOOD!!

Jesus -- this place was so intense. Whiskey bar and pound after pound of meat. The brisket, pork belly, pork ribs, pulled pork... oh god. All so good. Even the biscuits were good. It felt so bad but so good. Your platter is covered in fatty juices after completing the feast so make sure to soak it up in one of the rolls, add some bbq sauce, and call it dessert.

The place is a low-carber's dream. My boyfriend insisted on our short stay in New York that we *had* to eat at Fette Sau. He even went so far as to insist it is his favorite restaurant in the entire WORLD, and coming from someone who has been nearly everywhere, I had high hopes. Considering I haven't been out of the country, I can't say this is my favorite restaurant in the world, but it is definitely the best meat I've ever had. We went on a Sunday and he misread the website, so we got there about a half hour early and ended up being the creepy tourists (complete with rollie-bags) just hanging outside the fence for a half hour... but the dude who saw us twice or thrice was super-nice about it. We lucked out and the only person in front of us was some guy that went in while the gate was still closed, but the line began to form pretty much immediately after we arrived, so I can see how some people would be a bit annoyed with having to wait that long. Even if I go back (which I will, whenever I happen to be in NY again) and there's a super-long line, I will have no problem waiting. I dig the communal seating. ?The atmosphere is really casual and the employees I encountered were really chill and helpful. As far as specifics, we had the pork belly, pulled pork, beef ribs, and brisket. With each bite of a new meat I kept changing my mind on which I liked the best, but I finally decided that the pork belly was my absolute favorite. We don't use sauces, but this meat didn't need any sauce and I feel if we did use it, we wouldn't have gotten the full, delicious flavor anyway. THe only thing I wasn't stoked on was the broccoli salad. ?The broccoli was crisp and fresh-tasting, but I didn't like the sauce. ? But really, who cares about that? ?I didn't go to a BBQ restaurant to eat rabbit food anyway!

On my way to Knitting Factory, I pass by this bar. It's an early music show so my friend and I tell each other that we will definitely have to check it out after the show. I am so glad we did. Just as a note, this is a not a review of the meat here. This is a review of the bar. :) Lush, I know. We enter Fette Sau and our noses are infiltrated by the aroma of BBQ meat. It smells pretty good but I am a semi-devoted pescatarian and refuse to take a bite. We head straight to the bar, where I see knives as beer tap knobs. Well, that's interesting...I like! I forget what beer I pick but soon realize that beers are available by pint, quart, half gallon...and GALLON. Crazytown, if you ask me. The bartender is super friendly and every so often makes fun of my friend and I. All around, a great time...a definite bar to visit again.

Came here for a UYE and I am so glad I came out. As soon as I got here I jumped on line where I met another yelper [Sean] which who would have known be hanging with all night. The beer is good, they have all sorts of whiskey flight as well as a bourbon mule which was supper yum. The food was insane, we got a pound of everything!! I have the say the pork shoulder and brisket were to die for. The line was long but grab a beer and relax cause you are in for some good Q. Thanks IIeana for setting this all up, had a great time with everyone who partook ?in the festivities

Dudes, forget the corporate run bigs like Hill Country, Blue Smoke and Dinosaur. ?Fette Sau is the antithesis of everything mainstream. ? Get there a bit earlier or later, early dinner or late lunch cause it gets busy. ?Outdoor bench seating is preferable and beer in growlers is definitely a g-thang. ?All the beers are pretty standard for serving micro brews. ?If you're into beer, you'll know the names. ?I personally like to drink a pils due to the heaviness of bbq and shoot it up with some whiskey/bourbon (which they have). ? I would suggest the following things to order: everything. ?All of it is soft, moist and tasty. ?I personally loved the ribs (beef and pork) the most. ?But if they have the belly bacon, definitely get that as well. ?Brisket is moist, not fatty. ?For sides, the best is the burnt-ends baked beans. ?It looks like it's been simmering for days. ?I'm a sucker for carbs and the potato rolls they serve with every meal pretty much is icing on top. ? Sit outside, get a gallon and stuff yourself with, in my opinion, the best BBQ in NYC. ?I avoid all things hipster as much as I can, but damnit, Fette Sau is my kryptonite. As a side note: try to sit next to people from the area. ?I saw/heard a group of guys who were from around there and they befriended a couple sitting at their table by offering beer and bbq. ?I had to sit next to a bunch of annoying people from Manhattan who just kept asking me to move over a bit.

I am originally from North Carolina, so I have enjoyed my fair share of high quality BBQ. At Fette Sau, I had the pulled pork shoulder, beef brisket, pork belly, and the spicy berkshire sausage. ?All of it was really well prepared, but the reason I am writing this review is specifically for the sausage. ?Words won't do it justice, but just trust me, this is the greatest sausage you will ever consume.

Enough has been written about this place, for sure, but let me say, great place for barbeque. ?True that I'm only really remembering the brisket but , it absolutely melts, and it is flavorful. ?I also didn't come here for veggies, though I did have the beans. ?I only remember having brisket like this at Hill Country. ?True that I've not had brisket from a true southern barbeque and it might not be fair of me to say, but if my discerning Cantonese palate has anything to say about it... ?Also, it is the best I've had in New York City, or anywhere else that I've been for that matter. It is expensive however, at least for my shallow pockets. ?It also gets pretty packed but I've never seen lines waiting going out the door. ?If anything, you can always get it to go and hit up the park, or another bar, which is bountiful in the hip and trendy Williamsburg neighborhood. ? Unfortunately, most of my friends don't drink, and those that do, don't have much money (see the connection?) so I didn't enjoy that aspect of this communal, lodge-like atmospheric establishment so much. ?I will say that the selection of whiskey is huge. ? I also didn't think much of the beans. ?It tasted a bit burnt. ?I see the irony of complaining about how burnt the beans taste when I'm ordering Burnt Ends Beans but still. ? But as I've said, the brisket itself merits the five stars, as does the easy going atmosphere. ?There is always something very inviting about going to a place where you sit yourself, no one pesters you about how you're doing, and no one demands tips.

I agreed to meet my friend here for dinner yesterday. This is a big deal because I do NOT travel into Brooklyn. I got here before he did, around 6:15pm, and the place had a small crowd outside, but inside was empty. My friend showed up and we ordered a little bit of everything. Oh my sweet Jesus. I'm not even sure what I ate. A pork this. A beef that. Some kind of sausage. But all of it was AMAZING. I haven't had BBQ this good in years. By around 7:30pm the place was absolutely packed, and we decided to pick our full bellied selves up and head out to a bar (which will be reviewed next). I will definitely come back again. To think, charred meat will bring me back to Williamsburg.

The food at Fette Sau wasn't horrible (some tender cuts, some burned pieces, served a bit cold) but the sticker shock was enough to ruin it for me. My dinner for one which included one beef rib, one pork rib, a small potato salad, two pickles, and no drinks, came out to $34. Are you kidding me???!! For BBQ?? The guy behind the counter who cut my meat was nice, but the cashier girl with the beanie was pretty awful.

Even if barbeque is not your thing, Fette Sau might change your mind. No frills bbq joint offering up some of the best in the business making it worth your while to head off the rock into the lowlands of Brooklyn. If it's nice, the picnic tables outside, communal style, are the place to sit, otherwise the bar inside will suffice. Order beer by the jug, it's super excellent. Dark, gritty and perpetually busy, get in line and point to what you want. Sold by the pound means you can try everything. Sampled the pork belly, brisket and Spare ribs. Belly is no joke. This incredibly tender and crisp morsel of meat packs smokiness and spice into one bite. Ribs were surprising: looking rather thin and smallish, they came in as good as can be tasted anywhere. Incredible smoky pink meat, crisp layer on top of firm yet fatty pork. Do not let appearances deceive you: these bad boys are the real deal. Brisket is sliced thick and ranks as possibly the most buttery and fork "cuttable" yest tasted. Nice flaky meat with layer of fat and infusion of spicy rub. Absolutely incredible considering how dry brisket can become. Coleslaw was obviously fresh. Make the trek, you will not regret going.

Naaaaaaa 4 stars for this place? HA! I beg to differ. I came here with my bf, an avid, overly composed BBQ loving carnivore. This man will eat any and every part of an animal if it's seasoned properly. ?A chef in training I may add, who was totally disgusted and utterly disappointed with Fette Sau (as was I). The reason I mention him is because I, on the other hand only eat fish, an item that is NOT served AT ALL here at this slop hall looking BBQ joint! Anyways we attempted to come here once before (the time we actually came), and left because we saw there was no fish (and he felt bad). One late night after the club he was craving pulled pork and me.... well the sound of potato salad on a drunk gut sounded deelish! So we went to Fetty Sau, waiting on the very long line, ordered, and ate. We got home; he threw up. I didn't enjoy my potato salad, probably because it was German style so there was no mayonnaise, just vinaigrette. I could only eat a few bites unlike regular potato salad which I adore. We won't be back! FYI Fette Sau= Fat Pig in German.

I've been here several times. If you don't like to wait, get there at a weird time. It's open from 12 on weekends, so from around 2-6, it's usually pretty empty. ?The sides are not great (I did not like the baked beans, and I love baked beans). The kraut is not as smushy, it's a bit crisp, so that was good. The pickles are not very brined, and they kind of taste like soap to me, but I still get them. I like the slaw, but it's got a sesame/asian flavor that some people don't like. Now to the meat: PORK BELLY. I always get this. I get the St. Louis style pork ribs if they have them, but they don't always and then I'm kind of depressed. ?Brisket is ok. ?I like it better than the pulled pork. ?LOVED the spicy sausage (kind of like a hot keilbasa or something, really delicious), and the DUCK breast. That was the best duck I've ever had. ? Always get extra bread, a bag of chips, and if I am really treating myself, the key lime tart. One annoying thing (besides having to hover over tables for a seat like waiting for a space at the Target parking lot on Christmas eve), is that the bar is separate. You have to go there separately than the food. It's usually a team effort.

Holy meat. We went here to grab dinner before bowling, and at first I was a little hesitant. Good BBQ in NYC? It's as rare as finding really good mexican food here. The set up is great, it felt like a cafeteria except this cafeteria has food that can clog your arteries and instead of milk and juice Fette Sau replaced it with an extensive and might I say impressive bourbon selection. I wouldn't recommend taking a date here, there is no intimacy. BUT, it is a fun place to socialize with different people as they do not have traditional dining room table set-up. Long benches like the ones you sat at during lunch break in high school are filled with people from all over the US (and surrounding countries) sharing interesting stories, downing bourbon from mason jars (i LOVE mason jars), and enjoying every nitty gritty detail of the finger lickin good BBQ while warming up next to the flat screen tv that has a video loop of a fireplace burning. Basically, Fette Sau is an adult version of a traditional high school cafeteria.. Filled with bourbon and mind blowing BBQ. Meat at FS is by pound, and the meat and condiments come slapped on some wax paper that laid on a tray. Condiments such mustard, vinegar, and an assortment of different BBQ sauces are available at each table. We got the pork belly, brisket, and sausage. My favorite was the pork belly, of course because cammon' everyone loves pork belly am I right? The brisket was juicy and tender and probably the best brisket I've had in a while. The sausage was fatty, and smokey. Eating this made me love berkshire pigs and England way more than I ever have. Needless to say, we were completely stuffed and the 10 blocks to the bowling alley was agony. I had a great time, and will becoming back over and over again..With pepto-bismol. *Please play this song when you are reading this* http://www.youtube.com/w

Admittedly my expectations for this place were over the moon, so I don't know if it was ever going to live up. I had just heard so many good things, so maybe it was just impossible to match the hype. Important note: don't go here if the line is even slightly out the door. Or if you choose to do it, you should probably start reading War and Peace and hopefully finish it by the time you sit down. I'm not a logistics expert but there just has to be a better way to do this. I get that it's essential that everything is made to order. But the fact is the setup of one employee on carving and one employee on sides/cash register is just soul-crushingly slow. I didn't want to just review this to complain about the wait, so here's my take on the rest of the experience: ?over several trips I found the meats often too dry, too fatty, or, inexplicably, both at once. Some are definitely better than others...my personal recommendations are the sausage and ribs (both pork & beef). Unfortunately I also haven't fallen in love with the sides. The baked beans aren't bad but the rest just don't do it for me. On the plus side, I love the oversized beer jars, the general vibe of the place (including yule log running on loop), and the fact that the staff really does seem friendly and eager to help despite the never-ending line.

Love this place!!! From the broccoli to the rolls. The ?BBQ sauce that you almost don't need because the meat is all so damn good. Particularly the pork belly. Sausages are good too, and of course, so is the brisket. Careful to order w/your stomach and not eyes or you can run yourself an embarrassingly high bill, but it is worth it --and on the rare occasion you walk away with leftovers, they are almost as good that night or the next day. The line can be long so go during off hours if you can't stand to wait. Or get yourself some nice scotch or whisky since a line is usually inevitable. You can try to have a friend get some seats, but you'll most likely share a table, which is part of the experience. The only thing I dislike are the tiny sodas. But everything else about this great-smelling and cozy joint rules.

I don't go always go hogging but when I do it's heritage pork. Did you know pigs have a pouch where they carry the sins of mankind? I did not know this until I popped the first morsel of jowl in to my mouth which instantly melted in to what can only be described as liquid decadence. I think there might have been meat in it but I don't know or care because it would probably just get in the way. You can spread this stuff on toast because of how creamy, rich and soft it is. The brisket was good with a flavor I have never tasted before but be warned that it depends where in the cut your piece comes from that determines how tender it is. One slice was incredibly soft and another was much chewier and a little tougher. It's not gonna change your life but it should be on your brisket-to-try-before-I-die list. In must-have order on your first visit: 1. Brisket (beans as a side too) 2. Pork Jowl 3. Ribs 4. Sausage 5. Sirloin You'll probably order three out of that list tops unless you're some kind of sick bastard who can eat more than a pound and a half of fatty pork in one sitting. If you're with a big group you can all order a big heap of everything and figure out some kind of sharing arrangement to sample more things. Bring a pillow for the subway or have a car waiting for you when you get out cause the 'itis gonna get yo ass when you leave this joint son! After 1 1/4 pounds of glistening pork I was nodding off in to a smoke-flavored coma even a shot of adrenaline couldn't wake me from.

Omg prepare for a food coma. This place is awesome! Great food but when we went we had to wait in the longest line and it took forever.

Mmm, bar-be-cue...! We arrived on a weekday at 6pm; perfect because it wasn't packed and the line wasn't out the door as it can get. There were no seats initially, but by the time we got to the front of the line, a seat opened up - yippee! We ordered the brisket, lamb belly, Peking duck, spicy sausage and as sides, sauerkraut, pickles and baked beans. We also got a gallon of the Brooklyn IPA. (That's right, a gallon! It was awesome. *teehee*) The duck and sausage were delicious (the lamb was salty IMO), but the brisket! - omg, the brisket! - SO. SO. GOOD. It's definitely a must, must, must-try. There are various sauces on the table for the meats, not necessarily needed, but good to have. The one spicy sauce they had was very good, as was the mustard. Of the sides, the baked beans were fantastic. I'm not really a fan of baked beans, but these have so much flavor (probably from the bits of meat they put in there)... a perfect complement to the meal. ?I also enjoyed the sauerkraut; it cuts through all the meatiness (for lack of a better word). The pickles did as well, and they were very crunchy, but kinda bland in flavor - I'm not sure if I'd get it again. Now that the weather is nice, I'm definitely going back soon and sitting outdoors... and eating massive amounts of brisket.

You know a date is going well when you a) both agree on the two different half pounds of meat you are going to share b) recognize the beauty of a good potato salad and - most importantly - c) agree to throw caution to the winds and get the beans, because they look and smell too damn good. We got take out, which was fast. Service was super friendly. I (literally) ran back to my date's apartment around the corner, and took less than 5 minutes to unwrap all our porky, briskety goodies and start plating. Ladies, I'm about to get rullrull: get the beans. He's going to think you're more Sarah Silverman than Sarah Michelle Gellar, but it's worth it. And if he doesn't think Sarah Michelle Gellar circa Buffy is a hot lady, cut him now. Then, eat all the beans by yourself.

My never ending search for barbecue in NY led me here. ?Yeah, I'm a total barbecue snob and I've accepted the fact that I'll never find anything as good as the Midwest or South. ? But I jumped on the L train and made it out here anyway on a random Tuesday to find it packed. ?The seating is self service, so one person needs to get in line and one person needs to grab a table, don't make the mistake others made of being polite because you'll be left wandering around looking for a table with a big tray of food in your hands. We got some pulled pork, pork belly, brisket, sausage, pork ribs, baked beans, and broccoli salad. ? We'll just run this down item by item: Pulled pork...eh, pass on it, not up to Carolina standards at all and you'll even find better in NY I think. ?Pork belly, not bad, just realize you're basically eating a piece of fat...mmm. ?Brisket, I'd say this was good, melt in your mouth good, maybe one other spot in NY with comparable brisket. ?Sausage, one of the better ones that I've had, it wasn't some generic sausage flavor, hard to describe, definitely order it. ?Pork ribs, not quite fall off the bones finger lickin' good, but pretty close. ?Baked beans, have burnt ends in them and is definitely a nice hearty side. ?Broccoli salad...hey if you have to get some veggies involved, this isn't a bad choice. So here's my rundown, must get: brisket, pork ribs; should get: pork belly, sausage, baked beans, broccoli salad; would pass on next time: pulled pork.

RIDICULOUS brisket. ? Ode-worthy, really, were I capable of penning them. ?I don't know what authentic Texan barbecue is but I know what my taste buds say. ? I came for the pork belly and pulled pork but ended up unexpectedly digging the flavorful and yes, very moist, brisket. ? It had just the right amount of burnt, caramelized fat on the edges. ?In comparison the pulled pork was a bit dry and didn't pack the anticipated flavor. Burnt-ends baked beans are good too. ?But really, how could that not be. ? Space is an issue, wait time is an issue (get there before 6pm unless you enjoy watching people eat for an hour before you get your food), murderously hungry people turned vultures for table space is an issue. ?If you come with a big group, be prepared to split up. ? Nonetheless Fette Sau is worth the trip to Brooklyn at least once. ? ? For future barbecue fixes, however -- due to ?convenience, the ability to make reservations for larger groups, and the fried chicken, I would opt for Hill Country. ?But not without a twinge of regret.

Great ambience inside and out. Glorious hipster bbq. We had the brisket, pulled pork, pork ribs, baked beans, broccoli salad, and pickles. Brisket was fantastic: all at once tasty, moist, perfectly charred. Hands down, the best part of my meal. Pulled pork was rather dry and stringy. The ribs were seasoned to absolute perfection, with just a hit of a spicy kick. But they were dry, fat from fall-off-the-bone. The baked beans were just as good as everyone raves. And the broccoli salad (more of a pickled broccoli) was oddly addictive, though I wish they were chopped up a bit smaller/shorter as broccoli stem is just filler in my book. The pickle is actually a cucumber in brine...salty cucumber, you were misnamed. Overall, solid bbq joint to sit around with friends for hrs. We were fortunate to have gone at an off-hr and didn't have to deal with a line. But I can see the wait being a pain in the ass, as only one person takes orders AND carves. Management requires a lesson in efficiency.

I came as part of a group of four at 6:05 and ended up waiting in line for 30 minutes, but the line was nearly twice as long by the time we had gotten our food, so it behooves you to come early. However, I did notice several groups of people who had ordered beer at the bar and poured themselves cups from the growlers while waiting in line, which isn't the worst way to pass the time. They had unfortunately run out of pork belly, so we loaded up on beef brisket, veal, sausage, and ribs, along with a large burnt ends beans and eventually a mac and cheese (they had to make more, so they let us pre-pay and cut the line to pick up an order when it was ready). The meat was all delicious, and the two sides that we did have were also very, very good. The sausage was surprisingly spicy and probably my least favorite dish, while the beef brisket was probably my favorite. I would be willing to come back out here and try other dishes, especially the pork belly.

The ribs were out of this world but FORCED/PRESSURE TIPPING??? Is this the new low that so-called "tipping" has become? Apparently it has- evident at Fette Sau! *Takes a deep breath* All right, all right, the food first: I ordered the Berkshire St Louis Style Pork Ribs and a small potato salad. The potato salad was okay (too vinegar-y) but the ribs were really good- tender and juicy, pink on the inside. I usually like to have barbecue sauce drenched on ribs but they were good enough without them. However, I craved some deliciousness on my ribs so I tried a couple of the sauces-sweet and spicy-that were on the table (squeeze bottles with no labels). The atmosphere: Where was my cowboy hat, y'all?- country music was playing over the heads of ?chatting hungry barbecue lovers, giving off the vibe of a cafeteria at a ranch in the Wild Wild West. Or maybe an indoor picnic- people sat at three long communal tables in one room where you're elbow-to-elbow with strangers- too crowded (and noisy) for my preference, but what do you expect from a Zagat-rated barbecue joint? If there are no seats, wait until someone has had their fill of BBQ. The service: No sit-down waiter service over here- you ask for the food you want, they weigh the meat, and give everything to you on a ginormous tray then walk up to the register. The girl at the cash register mentioned something about tipping the kitchen staff and hands me the receipt for me to sign since I was paying with a credit card. Ignoring the tip line, I signed and handed back the receipt. She HANDS IT BACK TO ME (if I could put those words in bold, I would) and says that I HAVE to tip 20%. WTF!!!! First of all, it is not my responsibility, or any other customer's responsibility, ?to make sure that the kitchen staff are well-paid. It is up to the restaurant- any restaurant. That may sound B@%chy, but it's true- a tip is a small monetary gift that is given in appreciation of outstanding service that goes beyond what is expected. Don't believe me? Research the history of tipping. Second, how am I supposed to calculate 20% (that's what I heard, correct me if I'm wrong because I hope I am) of the damn bill with people waiting in line behind me? I am not a human calculator. Third, if tipping needs to be forced (?!) let people in line know in advance- put a sign in front of the register. Over the deafening noise, I originally thought that tipping was optional because I could barely hear the girl at the register- that's why I signed and handed the receipt with no tip at first. Afterwards, perhaps I mis-heard the 20%- it could have been 2% (hah!) or 200%. What about other patrons who could be hard of hearing? Bottom line: for a Zagat-rated, #1 BBQ joint that has thousands of patrons a day because of its popularity force customers to tip at the register where other patrons are waiting behind you is absurd. But the ribs were great, and I'm not going to lie- I will go back. But I'm knocking off two stars.

I went to Fette Sau this past Monday night around 7:30pm and hit it at exactly the right time. There was no line and we were able to get a table right away. 5 minutes later, a line formed and people were scrambling. Life is all about timing. I ordered a 1/4 lb. of beef brisket, a sausage, and German potato salad for myself because I hate to share. It came with 2 potato rolls. This was probably the ideal amount of food for me, but I could have definitely been a little piggie (sau?) and ordered another 1/4 lb. of meat. They use a dry rub on all their meats, but there are 2 types of BBQ sauce at the tables. The red one is sweet and the brown one is spicy. Take my advice and mix them both together. The brisket was absolutely hands down the best I have ever tasted. I would like to qualify this however; I have never had authentic Southern BBQ, I grew up in New Jersey, and they gave me a crust piece. All that being said, I stand by my claim. The meat was so succulent and flavorful, and the texture was perfect, fall of the bone, shredded. The sausage was delicious as well. It was plump and with the crisp "skin" casing that you want from a sausage. I was a little underwhelmed with the German potato salad. I had eaten such great potato salad in Munich that I expected this to be similar. It wasn't. There were mustard seeds, and the temperature seemed too cold. Oh well. I am not a fan of baked beans, but my friends all raved about them. So if you're into beans, then go for it. I will definitely be back, and I'm sure I will not luck out with the line/table like I did this past time. However, I will HAPPILY brave the crowds to get a taste of this amazing BBQ again. Better than Blue Smoke.

I usually love barbecue joints because it's easy to stay paleo. ?Not here. Everything came pre-sauced and no one could really say with certainty what the sauces contained. The broccoli salad rocked my world, but it's still broccoli salad. The ambience is cool- picnic table, Oktoberfest style, seat yourself; awesome outdoor section. ?But when you go to a barbecue spot and walk away with the broccoli salad, it feels like the time you're family forgot it was your birthday; ya know?

The beans with burnt ends were amazing. Beef cheeks were yummy. The pulled pork delicious. The beer was good. The food line was long and slow. The communal seating was interesting since we ended up with two different sets of table mates. Why would people bring their dogs to a barbecue place? I really don't know but I saw 2 dogs there during my meal. Weird!

Good but a bit overrated and overpriced. The price I usually pay over here for a simple plate of meat and a beer is roughly between 40-50 bucks. It gets really crowded in here. It's best to come right when they open, otherwise you'll be waiting in the cold for a very long period. The service is here is pretty good. They have a decent variety of meats to choose from. It's definitely nothing compared to Texas or any other type of BBQ joint in the south. Verdict - It's a type of place I would try out once or twice. Other than that, save your money and explore other places. Hipsters in Williamsburg seem to love this place but I don't. It's too small and I don't like the hipster atmosphere.

Meat. Bourbon. Beer. If you don't like what you've read so far, then don't bother reading the rest, because there's a whole lot more where that came from. Fette Sau easily equals the quality of Hill Country and Dinosaur BBQ, but far surpasses both on charm and ambience. We went on a Sunday around 2pm which was the perfect time to go. There was no line and still plenty of seating available. We knew we wanted brisket, and asked the lovely lady behind the counter to fill in the rest with her recommendations - which were pork belly and pork shoulder. The pork belly was ridiculous; slightly charred around the edges to add a smokey flavor to the succulent, buttery texture of the fatty part of the belly. The shoulder was a little dry, but that was easily remedied by adding any of the 3 delectable BBQ sauces that are provided at every table. The bourbon list was extensive, including an array of brands I have yet to try (and will definitely be making a return trip to do so). There were also some solid beers on tap, all of which pair well with a hearty meat feast. Bottom line, you won't find abetter BBQ anywhere in the city - and you certainly won't find a cooler venue to enjoy it in. So get off your keister and go stuff your face.

I am pretty sure I went on an off night or something. I tried the pork belly, Holstein top sirloin, sausage, duck, brisket, and beans. Everything, except the beans, was cold. Not right-out-of-the-refridgerator cold, but like, was made-yesterday-and-put-in-the-refridgerator and sort-of reheated-the-next-day cold. The fat on the brisket was white and sort-of solidified; if it had been warm, I'm sure the fat would have made the brisket juicy and flavorful The duck had really good flavor, and I'm sure if it was warm, it would be amazing. I might try it again, but for the price, it is definitely risky. I'm from Texas, so it is already hard enough to justify paying that much for decent barbecue, when I know juicy, flavorful brisket need only cost about $10 a plate.

Pork Belly, Sausage, Ribs, Brisket oh my!! This was by far one of the best BBQ joints I've been to in the NYC area. I will gladly return. Everything was cooked to perfection. Beautifully moist and full of flavor. NYC is not known for its BBQ however Fette Sau is holding our own! Bon Appetit!

I like BBQ. I do. But I don't know that I'm a big fan of Fette Sau. The Brisket had good flavor but it was dry. A dry brisket is like a dry hump - just a tease of what you actually want. The pulled pork was also on the dry side, but I guess that's not the worst thing in the world since most people just slather it in sauce anyway. Normally I would've given the place 3 stars, but their pickle policy forced me to drop it down to 2. Listen: When I ordered my meal, I ordered pickles on the side. The guy taking my order asked, "2 or 4?" I asked how big they were, he said big, but I went with 4 anyway because, let's be honest, one can never have too many pickles. When I got to the table I noticed there were only 3 pickles in my little tray. So I grabbed it and went back to the counter. "Excuse me," I said, "I ordered the 4 pickles but I only got 3." "They're big," the lady at the register said to me. "Ok. But I ordered and paid for 4. I only have 3." "They're bigger than they usually are. So you only get 3." "But I'm paying for 4?" "They're big," she said again, as if it was the most obvious truth in the world. But it wasn't - the pickles were average sized at best. When I didn't thank her for her generosity, she just looked at me like I was the stupidest person in the world. How could I not understand that it was totally cool to pay for 4 pickles and only get 3? I was causing a bottleneck on line and her eyes were already past me and on the person behind me, so I just called her shady and walked away. I wish I would've said something clever like, "So if I ordered 2 I only would've gotten one?" or, "Nice bandana, jerk." But I didn't.

I tried to remain open-minded about eating barbecue while visiting friends in Brooklyn. Coming from Central Texas, I kept telling myself, "I'm sure it's good for New York standards." But I'm used to eating this stuff once a week and make it a priority to try the best barbecue all over the country. To put it bluntly, it was some of the best barbecue I've had anywhere. I especially didn't expect to find brisket on the menu that far north. Don't come here unless you intend on ordering some of this moist, fatty, slow-cooked greatness, I'll quickly point out that the sausage was also very respectable and the side of spicy beans were good enough for me to consider getting seconds - a rare for me on sides. The meat is simply ordered at a counter by the pound and served on cafeteria trays lined with butcher paper; this made me feel at home. The rich, dark sauce must have had a fair amount of molasses and rendered fat but I couldn't figure out what other ingredients made it so delicious. I'm usually not an advocate of sauces either but, again, this one is worth trying - even though the brisket was excellent bare. Beer is served in large jugs - a nice touch - along with mason jar glasses. My friends assured me that a line is common and when the weather is warner the place can get out of control. So, get there early before any meat runs out. Already want to go back.

In what must certainly be a scheme to slowly take over Metropolitan Ave, Joe Carroll has created a gastronomic holy trinity between St. Anslem, Spuyten Duyvil, and Fette Sau. I have eaten at Fette Sau several times and have never met a cut that I didn't like. I haven't had the pleasure of trying all of their extensive meat list as they are in constant rotation. Most recently I can attest to the Berkshire pulled pork shoulder, Berkshire pork belly, ans spicy sausage. The shoulder was tender, the belly just fatty enough, and the sausage just dripping with juicy flavor. Of note, I remember one time I ate here and they were offering a cut called the tri-tip. If you happen to be lucky enough to come on a day this is offered I urge you to forgo whatever you were planning to order and get at least a quarter pound of this. It was one of the most tasty cuts of meat I've had and every time I return I hope to see it up on that chalkboard menu. There are three sauces on the table a standard BBQ, another sauce that has a really strong smoky/pepper flavor, and a vinegar sauce. The BBQ is hands down the best as the other two can be a bit overwhelming but in moderation they are fine. A large whiskey selection and ample beers on tap served in Mason jars (you are in Williamsburg after all) help to wash down all that tasty meat you're consuming. The seating is mostly made up of large communal tables and the place can get pretty crowded with a long line during peak hours. I would recommend going shortly after they opened to ensure that you don't miss out on any of that day's meats.

Be prepared to wait. I got here at 3:45 on a Saturday and stood on the line for an hour and 15 minutes. I have to say, they really should come up with a better system to serve everybody. It's basically one dude serving up every order and when each order is carved to order, this process takes forever. The seating is communal, not the most comfortable, and crowded. But this is a no frills place and all about the barebecue. I called earlier in the day to ask for what meats were on the menu to plan ahead of time. I was told about 6-7 meats and went in planning on the bone-in short ribs, a special of peking duck, the ubiquitous brisket, and pork belly. Of course as you sit on the line, envious of the hipsters already enjoying mounds of delicious CUE, you are hoping and wishing that they do not run out of the good stuff. So of course as I finally got the counter they were out of the bone-in beef short ribs, pork belly, and duck much to my dismay. Having to switch gears, I went with the brisket (extra fatty), boneless short ribs, and a pork chop that had been added the menu when the ran out of the pork ribs (you can see that they run out of stuff VERY early considering they are open until 11pm). To round out the meal I went with the burnt ends baked beans. So how was the food? Was it worth the hassle of long wait and communal seating? One other thing I want to mention is it is not cheap. They charge by the pound and you can easily over order. Especially, if you are alone. The best approach would be to come with a group so it isn't so expensive. Yes, I ordered lots of food and it cost me $45. I could barely get through half of it. I headed to a bench outside since it was a nice day, with my heaping plates of meats, beans, and 2 soft rolls. They had 4 different sauces on the table but the only one I liked was the traditional sweet bbq. Spicy mustard, chili vinegar, and a spicy bbq were the others and not appealing and overpowering. The best thing I ate was the brisket. It was extremely well done. Fatty as requested, juicy, melt in you mouth. I only wish they would have included some more bark (it should also be noted that when I finally got to the counter they were switching carvers since it was 5pm and the new guy seemed very disoriented and not as good as the other guy). I had a brisket at Smorgasburg earlier in the day at Lonestar Empire and honestly they were neck and neck. So it didn't blow me out of the water, but when done right its really delicious. The boneless short ribs were also very good. When I got to the counter, there was barely any of this left as well. I would have loved to try the big bone in babies that I love, but these were a good fall back. The flavor between this and the brisket was similar, however the ribs were a little blacker. Most pieces were juicy but since I managed to get the last few pieces left, some were a bit dry for my taste. I am the type who enjoys his pork pink. Of course, when speaking of BBQ, the pork chopo is cooked all the way through. But I must say even cooked through, they managed to keep the meat incredibly juicy and moist. I think it has to do with the slow smoking and the fact that they are smoking the racks of pork whole to keep the juices in together. The baked beans were really really delicious. Some of the best I've had, and I loved the fact that they stuck a huge chunk of burnt ends in there. By this time though I was really full and kind of suffering from meat overload. Overall, I enjoyed the food very much. Would I wait on line for over an hour again? No way in hell. Especially when you can't be guaranteed the meats you want will be there when it's your turn to order. They also really could beefen up their list of sides. I mean how do they not have mac and cheese on the menu at all times? If I have the chance to go on an off peak hour and get there right when they open, I'd come when the urge for bbq hits me.

We were in the area and checked YELP for suggestions, Both me and my buddy were very happy we did , not only delicious BBQ but overall great fun experience . The line was about 40 min long, ?it was a sat night about 7pm. Started chatting with other people in line and actually made some new friends. The house drink (served in mason jars which was very cool) called Thirsty Mule Or drunken Mule...just ask for the MULE.... was awesome ! had 2 each while on line made with Bourbon, beer, lime and I think seven up.... delicious and great little buzz to get things started. Brisket, good , Pork belly - excellent , pulled pork - great , beans great, ? they had ?just ran out of duck while we were next on the line but we tasted some from the friends we made while on line and it was killer . everyone just kinda finds a spot on big long benches and shares tables. fun place , relaxed and great BBQ ! great tunes in back round, I will BE back soon.

I'm honestly not a BBQ expert, but I know good meat, and Fette Sau has it. ?My boyfriend and I got a total of 1.5lbs of meat. ?1/2lb beef brisket, 1/2lb pork shoulder, and 1/2lb pork belly. ?We also got a large side of the German potato salad. ?The amount of meat we had was probably a little more than what we needed, especially given the fattiness of it all. ?But it was all so good! ?The beef brisket had the perfect balance of lean meat and fat. ?The pork belly was honestly probably a little fattier than what I like, but it's pork belly, so what do you expect. ?The pork shoulder wasn't as tasty as I would have liked, although the bbq sauce helps out a bit. ?Out of the 3 meats we had, I probably liked the beef brisket the best. ?It was definitely the most moist brisket I've ever had. ? Probably the worst part about Fette Sau is the line. ?We came around 9pm on a Saturday and waited maybe about 30-40 minutes. ?The plus is that you can get a drink at the bar while you wait in line. ?The only have one guy cutting and weighing the meats and one cashier. ?I'm sure if they had just one more person handling the meats, the line would move so much faster. ?Though it probably makes sense that they do that...no one really had to wait around for seats to open up, so I suppose it's the right balance anyways. ? Lastly, the prices are very reasonable given the quality. ?1.5lbs of meat and one large side came out to $34, and we were VERY full.

Delicious BBQ in the heart of hipsterdom. In the name of research, I had to try a little bit of everything. Or cuz I'm a fatty. Tried the... St. Louis pork ribs - 5/5 Pulled pork - 5/5 Brisket - 4/5 Hot link - 4/5 Baked beans - 4/5 (More a ranch bean/spicy style than a sweet/maple bean) German potato salad - 2/5 (Regular potato salad is so much better, not sure why they had to mess with that one) The sweet rolls were incredible and made awesome 'lil pulled pork sammies. Table sauce was tasty and a good add on everything. The mustard sauce was super horse radishy so be warned. Great selection of beers and libations to wash down the pork.

In my limited list of BBQ adventures through New York, Fette Sau comes closest to replicating my most memorable experience of eating cue in Austin, TX. Unlike some other bbq places in new york, it's not a restaurant impersonating a bbq joint. Fette Sau's a no-frills, free-for-all, wait-on-line place where you walk past an auto-repair shop on a sparse block of Metropolitan and look for a small neon sign. Thankfully we got there at a quieter time around 2pm on a saturday because I can definitely see space being an issue with just 3 communal picnic tables in the small interior. ?Along one wall is a pretty stacked bar where they also sell various local brews by the half pint, pint, and larger. Just out of curiousity, I asked to see the half pint glass and I quickly changed my mind to a pint. That half pint glass might as well be a shotglass. On the other side was the wall of BBQ: a display of various meats, smoked and steaming. Behind the display was the cutter, who took our order of brisket, pork belly and boneless beef rib by the 1/4 pound, and sliced our meat to order. At the end of the line was our metal tray with our cuts of meat, complimentary Martin's potato rolls, and our small sides of cole slaw and German potato salad. One bite of that brisket was all I needed to tell me that this place was worth coming back for. The fatty brisket was juicy and flavorful: it was just as good alone as it was in a sandwich I made with the roll, sesame-based cole slaw and Fette Sau's spicy bbq sauce. The boneless beef rib and pork belly were also very good but wow, that brisket was amazing. We ordered a 1/2 pound of brisket, 1/4 pound of pork belly, and a 1/4 pound of beef rib, and it was more than enough for both of us. ?At $16 per pound for everything but the beef rib ($24 per lb), they aren't Austin prices but for about $30 including sides for 2 people, the meal was certainly worthy of the trip to billyburg. And that brisket is priceless.

Apparently there exists a non-trivial segment of the population who enjoys ordering meat by the pound. In theory, I was no exception and thus, in need of an interesting dinner excursion, my friend and I required little convincing to venture over to this barbecue haven. Forearmed with the knowledge that the lines could be perilous, we ate relatively early and were still confronted with a twenty-minute queue, which was no big deal on a lovely summer's evening. The place itself is reminiscent of a garage workshop (apparently the aesthetic of choice when it comes to barbecue) and, as we waited in line, we studied the numerous options on the menu board, attempting to limit our salivation in polite company. A pound of this and a pound of that? Can we do half a pound of the other? What about a side of burnt end baked beans? With serious negotiations underway, we almost broke under pressure when it came to ordering, but ended up with a pound of the Berkshire belly and half a pound of the brisket together with those beans as a side. To say that the order was gluttonous is putting it mildly and, with pounds and mounds of food before us, we expected great things indeed. Making our way to the long communal tables, we grabbed the free bread rolls and got down to business. "So? What do you think?" to which my eating companion responded, rather unconvincingly, "Good. What do you make of it?" What did I make of it? As far as barbecue goes, it was fine - A-OK as Yelp likes to define it and the brisket was actually quite tasty. However, as my friend suggested, Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is probably better. The bread rolls were not even worth the calories - perhaps cheap bread rolls are the standard barbecue accomplice (I'm not generally a huge barbecue fan and so I am wholly uneducated in this field)? The baked beans were incredibly mediocre and we both gave up on that front. Needless to say, our eyes were far bigger than our stomachs and there was probably a pound of meat remaining when we threw in the napkins, surrendering to the charging cholesterol clogging our arteries. The sad fact was that neither of us wanted to take the heap of flesh home for subsequent meals - it just wasn't that good. Conclusion: If you're in a barbecue state of mind and are looking to grab a beer and pounds of meat in the Williamsburg area, Fette Sau is probably a good option. A casual, drawn out (expect an interminable wait) meal on a lazy summer evening - why not? Will you find salvation in this barbecue? No. Will you be dreaming of this for days? I hope not. Is it possible that, like me, you'll err on the side of vegetarianism for a while after said meal? That, dear Yelper, is entirely possible.

Cool spot. Definitely worth a visit to all the BBQ inclined! More importantly, they have one of the best, if not the best, selections Rye though. They have this one called Blue Hill (or something like that)... so good, so expensive ($35 a glass), but well worth it. You'll definitely see me at the bar! Rye makes me feel good. I give Fette Sau four stars on their Rye selection alone. Although I recognize the brilliance of this restaurant, it was actually Fette Sau that inspired me to give up meat! Like any all-American country boy, I grew up on the type of food Fette Sau serves. So after years in the big city, I welcomed a little slice of back home. However, after gorging there one night, I was just so full and bloated that I felt disgusted with myself. It all tasted very good though.

After eating here, I was wondering how people can be vegetarians because pork is so effing delicious. I felt like Homer at his own BBBQ and there wasn't a Lisa in sight ?to stop me from enjoying this glorious swine (Props if you get the reference) Naive as I was, I really thought the best place to get BBQ in the greater NYC area was at Hill Country (Which isn't saying much) but boy was I wrong. I had the pork belly, pulled pork and brisket and the pork belly is by far the best thing here and that's saying a lot because the pulled pork and brisket was pretty effing good. The Hawaiian rolls just go so well with the BBQ, I just couldn't stop smiling like an idiot enjoying this glutinous bliss. The sides are ehh, the pickles were really pickley at all and the beans weren't anything special. I'm definitely coming here again and hopefully soon.

One day I was strolling around Williamsburg and wandered into this alleyway where drinks were served in mason jars and BBQ meat served on aluminum. "What is this place?" I though, as I wandered down the alley. Turns out I had found the entrance of Fette Sau, Unfortunately, I had already stuffed myself with food at Smorgesburg, so I left with a desire to come back and try their BBQ. ?That day came when one of my friends from St. Louis came into the city for a day. After a combined 10 years of living in St. Louis, we've had our fair share of BBQ and we put Fette Sau up to the test. What we got and the judgement: 1/2 of Brisket: We wavered a bit and almost skipped the brisket. Luckily, you can order in at least 1/4 increments, so we got a half pound of brisket and we weren't disappointed. The brisket was very moist and flavorful. Up there with the best brisket in NYC. 4/5 1/2 of Pulled Pork: I judge the quality of a BBQ place by their pulled pork and this was kinda disappointing. The pulled pork was dry and the bark was a little too caramelized. The smoke flavor wasn't there. I would skip this if I came here again. 2.5/5 1/2 of Beef Ribs: My friend never had beef ribs before, so we gave this a try. For the messy-disinclined and price-inclined, they take the meat off the bone for you so you get the bang for your buck without having to use your hands. Lots of yummy, moist fatty pieces of meat. 3.5/4 1 Small BBQ beans: Pretty good BBQ beans. I don't know how they get the smokiness flavor in but its adds another dimension to the BBQ beans. Note: I couldn't find the pork belly on the menu!!!!! And I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE pork belly. So we didn't order it... :'( guess I'll have to come back... We got to Fette Sau at 7PM on a Thursday and waited for 20 minutes to make an order, but the line quickly grew behind us and by the time we left at 830PM, the line was still out of the door. Surprisingly, despite its popularity, we didn't have a problem finding a seat at one of the long wooden tables. My friend pointed out the interesting decor, specifically the wall decorated with pictures of where different cuts of meat come from, while I was fascinated by their full whiskey bar. The prices for beer are pretty much the same ($6 a pint) even if you buy bigger sizes, but don't you want to carry around a 1/2 gallon bottle of beer and drink it from a mason jar like a hill-billy. A great BBQ experience in NYC. Probably one of the best in NYC and can tide me over until I go to the South. 4/5 stars.

One cannot extricate the concept of BBQ from a certain setting, a certain mindset, and perhaps, a certain clientele. You can take slathered ribs and brisket from the best joint in the South and put it on a plate at Per Se, but it will not be the same at all. This place gives the illusion of a proper setting: communal tables, unmarked bottles of sauce (which are not good), beer served in glass jugs. It is, however, a sham. There is space for a line of maybe 20-30 people inside the restaurant, while everyone else has to wait outside (bad in the winter!). Rather than feeling a communal spirit in the establishment, I got the feeling that everyone would be pissed if you got sauce on their plaid or knocked over their jug of PBR, good conversation be damned. It would be impossible to have good conversation anyway, as this place is EXTREMELY loud, with the meat-dude-guy messing up orders ("Hi can I have half a pound of brisket?" - "You want to have a pound of brisket! Sure!"). The food is disappointing. I'm not a BBQ buff, or a fan really, but I am certainly capable of enjoying it and recognizing quality as evidenced by my Dinosaur BBQ (in Syracuse) review. The meats here either taste unappealing, or do not taste like anything at all. I tried the brisket, pulled pork, pork belly, sausage, and ribs. Everything was lacking, in flavor and especially in heat. The meats were not piping hot, which made us having to sit on the outside benches in the 40 degree weather even worse. I also had the baked beans, cornbread, and sauerkraut, none of which were appetizing either; the baked beans tasted like solidified pieces of vinegar and had me longing for canned Bush's baked beans. The price for this sad food is ridiculous. 18 dollars a pound. Yep. For fucking ribs and pork belly. I can pay a cheaper price for the best cut of beef tenderloin and make a gourmet meat dish myself. For what I got here for $40, I could have gotten at a GOOD BBQ place for $14. I'm not gonna pay this premium for poorly flavored cold food, eardrum-rupturing noise levels, and douchebags looking annoyed when I try to politely squeeze past them to take my food tray to the cold outside area. Just because you wear bigger glasses than I do doesn't mean you are a bigger man (and you're probably not 'cause I'm a tall motherfucker).

Eeeep! ?Finally, two years later, I taste of your sweet pork nectar again. ?After much hyping, I brought the hubs, who also liked it. ?We split pork belly, pulled pork, BBQ beans, and roasted potatoes with bacon. ?NOTE: you must get the beans, and slather them on your meat, so the amazing sauce heightens your experience. ?The bacon-y potatoes looked a lil brown and sad, but they tasted fantastic -- very soft, huge chunks of bacon. On my first visit, I also loved the broccoli, pickles, and beef brisket. ?Not so much the cheek, but hard cider made up for that. ?I think the prices are pretty good considering the quality and time that goes into the dishes, and it helps that since there's no service, you don't have to tip and can sit and eat at leisure. ?Yes, you have to refill your own water glass. ?But I wouldn't have it any other way.

Things I like about migrating to Fette Sau on the weekends: -rubbing elbows with Anne Hathaway on the L train (leave me alone, I'm a celebrity gawker) -watching Anne Hathaway walk in the opposite direction (good, more meat for me) Things I like about Fette Sau on the weekends: -chugging down a jug of Kelso while in line -eating with Brits who don't eat pork (good, more pork for me) -the crowd (Fette Sau is the place to be!) Things I love about Fette Sau on the weekdays: -the absence of the crowd (who cares about see and be seen? I want a table!) Wow like night and day Fette Sau is weekday vs. weekend. I much prefer quiet Monday nights and cue. We arrived with an abundance of tables to choose from, a sight unimaginable during the peak hipster hours of soaking up a hangover. The line was relatively short (a good 15 ft from the register) and everyone's eyes weren't ready to rip the piece of cue off of my fork. All in all, Fette Sau is a chill place to be on a Monday night. I was able to enjoy my sausage without anyone breathing down my neck to move over or pressuring me to finish my meal in record time. For four people, we chipped in about $20/head and were sufficiently stuffed with a sausage each, large sides of German potato salad and burnt ends baked beans, sodas, a half lb of pork shoulder, pulled pork, boneless beef ribs and brisket, and a qtr lb of pork ribs. It was just the right amount and we slathered it all in barbeque sauce. A few dots of the spicy were enough to make us go whew! It was good and I still stand by my favorite- the brisket. Everything else can kinda kiss it. Fette Sau is awesome. Highly recommend for groups and a good time. The open air of it all is priceless. Plus the picnic tables kinda make it feel like a real bbq. Just pretend you are at a park? *illusion switch on*

Tried many of the items.. BRISKET IS THE BEST! ? ?ANYWHERE. EVER. ? Ambiance is cool as a hell....the way its positioned right next to a garage and how it can be a bit difficult to find. ? dig it.. I'm a fan.. but only for the Brisket. ?The baked beans were a different take, my girl liked it b/c it was saucy but it was just a tad too salty for me.

Cons: Lines are long, seating is communal and not super comfy, and the employees serving food are downright rude. Almost soup-nazi-like. They will ask you a question, but they will already know the only acceptable answer: "can I get just a little more pulled pork?" "what, like a quarter pound?" "sure...unless you can do a little less.." "NO! only 1/4 pound increments" (looks super pissed off that I even dared to ask) "okay...obviously i'll take that since I have no other choices.." Pros: The pulled pork is downright delicious. Just what I'd been craving. The brisket wasn't good at all, super fatty, though the flavor of the sauce it was cooked in was tasty. The meats come with soft and fluffy potato rolls (baby ones!) so you can make your own sandwich, or just swirl it around in the different bbq sauces they have on the table and stuff it in your mouth. Baked beans were alright, but nothing too special. I'd come back here (prepared to know how exactly to order!), with someone to go and get drinks/find a seat while I wait in line, and get some delish pulled pork. I'd be up for trying other meats, too, and the mac'n'cheese which looked yummy. Prices are solid for what you get!

I'll make it brief because I probably can't contribute too much more than the other rave reviewers have. LOVE. Let me start by saying I hardly ever eat meat. J on the other hand, is a serial carnivore. Is there such a thing? Regardless, he is also a major fan of the Que, having lived in TX. Me, not so much. He would travel far and wide for good brisket and good beef ribs. We were in NY for the day and he had been dying to go here. So even though it was absolutely POURING rain and miserable out, I agreed to make a stop here. I fell in love. Suddenly I had carnivorous urgings. I NEEDED another bite of brisket (which I swear I normally dislike) and another and another. I needed to have pulled pork and I needed to eat a whole rib all by myself. I never do this. Never ever. I usually eat sides, some chicken and maybe some pulled pork. Here, at Fette Sau, I had seconds and thirds of everything. It was disgusting actually. But since in this case "disgusting" is a good thing, GO. RIGHT. NOW.

What is everyone raving about?! The BBQ is good, don't get me wrong. But is it worth an hour wait in line to then have to literally hunt for a space to eat at the communal table that is so small you bump elbows while trying to cut your BBQ meats? I think not. Went on a Saturday at around 6-7PM and the line was out to the street. Did the whole half gallon/gallon of beer thing while waiting on line and that at least softened the blow of the wait. Once I got up to the meat counter you are in such a rush to order that you can't really chat with the guy serving the BBQ to get an idea of what or how to order. After that you have a nice tray of meats that gets cold as you A.) wait 20 min or longer for a space to open up at the communal Tables or B.) go eat outside in the cold during the winter. I can definitely taste that the BBQ is good, damn good, but the overall experience and what I call "cut throat dining" really outdid the food for me. I'll have to go again when it's not so insanely crowded, but until then I can't give more than 2 stars for the overall experience.

i hate williamsburg! However, if you told me we were going to Fette Sau, i would hop skip and jump over. there is something about properly smoked fatty meat! is ever meat here amazing? Like every restaurant, you need to know what to pick. personally, i love their sausages, and pulled pork. the brisket, if asked for the fatty portion is also pretty damn good! Next time i go, i will order the sides, for some strange reason, when ever i go to BBQ restaurant, all i ever do is order pounds upon pounds of meat and never really order sides...

Being an Aussie I haven't been to many American BBQs so don't have much to compare this to but my gosh this place was one of the top things I did in NYC! We had to wait agesssss in line- which meant by the time we got to the front we were fairly intoxicated but so cheerful and hungry that we ordered a good few kilos of meat. When we reached our table of new yorkers we were provided a challenge - little did they know who they were dealing with. For starters we were so tight on cash that we had to finish everything so we got to get our moneys worth. And also- its seems it must run in the family, if my brother or I have the slightest bit to drink we tend shovel copious amounts of food into a endless black hole. So it began. And wow we didn't need any help shovelling - the pulled pork was so tender and tasty it pretty much slid straight down our throats! I would highly recommend that. We had some beef ribs and some chorizo and other kinda meats but without a doubt the pulled pork was a family fave. The sides were pretty damn good too- for sides- they def didn't steal the limelight from the main attraction though. Would for sure come back here when I return to New york. Be sure to get in early to avoid the lines or bring a bit of extra cash so you can enjoy waiting in line!

It's been a long, long time since I've been to Fette Sau but I imagine they are just as good as ever. I remember the bbq (I had the chicken and pork) being very tender and came with a variety of sauces. The pickles are the great, crunchy, cucumbery kind that aren't too briney and contrast the spicy sauces well. The baked beans are rich and sticky with molasses, and the coleslaw is even good - not laden with mayonnaise like most. The meat comes from a reliable source as well so you don't have to feel as guilty about your carnivorous choices. A large bar lines the back wall as well and plenty of beer, cider, and whiskey choices (including whiskey flights) abound. The overall decor is well done; I love the hot-pink florescent sign that is in no way indicative of a bbq joint. I love the garage door that closes off the inside from the outside, the fact that you stand in a line for your food and order by the pound, and the animal diagram paintings on the walls. The picnic table seating can be difficult to grab sometimes, but have a friend save a space for you while you wait in line for a bite to eat.

Great BBQ! The bar: ?Fette Sau has a dizzying bourbon/whiskey list (including VanWinkle!) as well as a blackboard with themed flights (1 oz) - at around $15-20 per flight of 3, its a nice way to expand one's palette without emptying the wallet.. The bar area also has some dangerously-inspired creative beer tap handles made from various butcher knives/forks (watched 2 people taking pics of them while I sat, so I'm sure there's enough photos of them already here..) and were pouring a good mix of local beers (SixPoint, Brooklyn, Cottrell, Green Point, etc) and hard cider (nothing goes with BBQ pork like cider!) ?The drafts are all served in jars, and a nice touch is you can buy any volume from a half pint to a gallon (obviously NOT served in a jar). The 'Q: Prices are listed by the pound, so don't be dismayed when you see the board. The carver was friendly and helpful, and weighed every portion perfectly - not to miss mentioning, items that weren't carved (baked beans, pulled pork, etc) were stirred before pulling out each serving, ensuring a good mixture each time. The beef brisket was mouth-watering and needed no sauce whatsoever. Pulled pork was equally tasty but even better with their sauce. The pork belly had run out while I waited in line, but they brought out sirloin tips (my favorite!) right as I got to the counter - WIN! ?The sides shouldn't be forgotten either: smokey mac & cheese, burnt ends baked beans (with bits of "unintentionally" dropped pulled pork inside - NOT a complaint), collard greens, all delicious. Things I'd change: The only lacking factor here is the absence of waitstaff: you have to que up (sorry couldn't resist) on a painfully slow moving line which varied from almost no wait (maybe 5 mins) to an excruciating 30+ in the approx 2 hours that I spent there. With a group of people you may want to pool cash, write orders, and then draw straws to see who's gotta wait and who gets to chill at the long picnic tables set up all over. If you're not completely heartless, maybe buy em a beer to keep company with.. Whole pig roasts first Thursday of every month! ?I can't wait for pig cheeks!

What a great find! So the bf and I had heard of this place but never felt the need to make the trek over. While randomly exploring the other day we passed it, saw the benches outside and considered how awesome this place would be in the summer and decided to give it a try. So good!!!! What can I say that hasn't been said? GREAT BBQ and some darn good eating. We tried the: Pork ribs - Amazing Brisket - Good but not great Links - Amazing Baked beans - Great - the bf liked them but I wanted something sweeter so I'll say great but not amazing Mac n cheese - Great - our batch was a little more bland than I had anticipated but were still on point Although the communal seating was a bit munch (we were definitely haggling for seats) it added to the ambiance and was great for striking up conversation with neighbors. 1 star off for some good but expensive eating but since this place doesn't peg itself as a hole in the wall I can't expect hole in the wall prices. Also I really wanted some house made sweet tea and not the bottled kind!! However with a 4/5 I obviously wasn't too mad.

I see you, Fette Sau. ? I enjoy the ambience and overall design of this place, which helped me deal with the long wait for food (as did the mixed drink in my bag...what?) and who's to argue with pork served by the pound?? ?I came here with a large group of people, so we did what you're never supposed to do in horror movies and split up to complete our mission: one contingent to buy a gallon of beer, and myself and a few others to purchase fooood. ? When we finally got up to order, our cashier politely inquired as to how many people were in our party, apparently alarmed at the quantity of meat we were asking for. ?We assured him there were more people waiting to enjoy this steaming goodness, and lugged a tray piled high with pork belly, brisket, pulled pork, baked beans, broccoli salad, and a bazillion biscuits. ?It was all rull good, my only complaint was the excessive fat on all the meat, but I guess that's better than it being dry.

Totally overrated! The wait is ridiculous and I hate that I have to be walking around the tables hoping people are friggin' done. The quality of the meats is great, but I don't think the seasoning is anything special and the BBQ sauce tastes like Ketchup. I have gone with people that love it though (including Texans) so it's one of those places that you either love or hate.

The setup is bare-bones; you order at the counter where they slap your food on a plate, and then you proceed to sit at communal tables with shared sauces. We got the broccoli salad, which was lightly marinated and heavily spiced with red pepper flakes, but delicious nonetheless, and the pickles, which were less salty than the store bought variety and crispier. The brisket, pork sausages, and sirloin tip were all moist and flavorful and we wished we had ordered more meat and less sides. Hey, there's always a next time.

Fette Sau is totally worth whatever pain-in-the-ass line you have to wait in to order your food. ?And whatever crazy-stalker-esque behavior you have to engage in while attempting to grab enough seats for you and your friends to chow down on some delicious smoked meat. I'd bookmarked this place long ago, and was super-psyched that I finally had the chance to give it a try on a recent trip to NYC. ?We got here pretty late (after 10pm) on a Saturday, and the place was pretty crowded. ?The line wasn't as long as I'd feared, and we were able to snag seats, drinks, and a huge platter of smoked meat within about an hour of getting there. I think we tried just about everything on the menu - ribs, pulled pork, spicy sausage, brisket, pork belly, baked beans, and German potato salad. ?The only thing we wanted that they were out of were the pickles. ?Everything was outstanding. ?The pork belly, brisket, and ribs have to be my stand-out faves - each of these practically melted in my mouth. There were a variety of sauces on the table, but my favorite had to be the original. ?The mustard-vinegar version reminded me a little too much of Chinese mustard, which wasn't the look I was going for with my bbq. Dining is family-style, so don't be shy about asking your neighbor to pass you that roll of paper towels - you'll totally need 'em! One criticism, the mason jars the drinks were served in tasted way too strongly of the bleach they use to clean them. ?Definitely a turn off from my otherwise pretty tasty cider.

Fette Sau, like Williamsburg, isn't immediately inviting with its warehouse atmosphere, its self-service or its long lines. But when the wait is over, you'll be greeted by friendly servers, and, ultimately, great barbecue. I shared the pork shoulder, brisket, beans, coleslaw and sausage. The meat was tender and juicy. The barbecue sauce at the table was sweet and smokey, like the beans. I'm typically uninterested in coleslaw, but their version was no blob of mayonnaise. It had a light, sweet sauce on it with crunchy cabbage. They've also got a good selection of beer at reasonable prices.

Sad to say that recent meals here have fallen short of the once epic meat mayhem that I experienced in years past at Fette Sau. In fact, I dare say I've had better BBQ at Hill Country than what I gnawed on yesterday evening. But before I whine about the pitfalls, I'll wax poetic about the things I love here. The location is prime, right off Metropolitan it's an easy ride from the city and the front picnic tabled alley is perfect for kicking back on a warm summer's day. The staff is always friendly and unpretentious, the selection of bourbons and beers are a nice afterthought. But should you desire to dine here, be sure to get there around 7pm... right before the rush starts and a line out the door forms. Good luck finding a seat to enjoy your carnage as well, since for all the hype it does not inhabit a very large space. As far as your meat options, I found the 1/4 lb of pork rib was juicy but the 1/4 lb of was brisket dry to the point of dehydration and I hardly touched it. My side of Pickle Guys half sours was delicious, though I already knew that those were a winner. I found the potato salad overly oily and the baked beans were both undercooked and ketchupy. The accompanying dinner rolls were straight from the grocery store, but still soft and pillowy. Honey butter as a condiment would have been a nice touch. All this ran my a little over $20 but for anyone with a significant appetite I've seen folks spend upwards of $40/pp. And to be honest, it didn't scratch my carnivorous itch. Perhaps they've been off due to their constant lines and endless hype, but I'm still in search of excellence... and it looks like Dinosaur still has my heart.

sorry fette sau, i really wanted to like you, but you are not worth the hour wait and the drive there to "hipster" brooklyn. we went there on a friday night and got there around 8ish, maybe even 9ish. ?i forgot. ?i knew i would have to wait at least an hour so i didn't mind. ? we ordered: ribs: these were okay, but the meat didn't really side off the bones as easily as places like dinosaur bbq. ? it was a tad bit dry and was just okay. sausage: these were good and i have no complaints. ?the amount of spice was just the right kick. brisket: these were okay. ?i wanted more taste since they were kind of tasteless and could have used some more seasoning. ? they were tougher than i would have liked, but otherwise just okay. ? these weren't the melt in your mouth brisket that i am used to. pulled pork: did not like these at all. ?it was so dry and you needed a lot of bbq sauce. pork belly: this was okay as well. ?it had a lot of fat and was dry and a little tasteless. ?i understand pork belly is supposed to have fat, but at least be fat and juicy and be melt in your mouth. ? if you want good pork belly, i'd recommend ippudo's pork belly sandwich (although this ramen place isn't worth the hour long wait either). overall, i don't mind waiting in line if it is worth the wait. ?however, the food was so tasteless and i'd rather go somewhere else like dinosaur bbq if i am craving bbq. ? (dinosaur bbq is worth the hour wait and the drive all the way to harlem.) ?i was expecting mind blowing melt in your mouth bbq meats, but fette sau did not offer it. this place was also really expensive and not worth my $100 ish dollars. ?i don't mind spending money on food if it's worth it, but this was definitely not worth my money. people come here because of word of mouth and because it's zagat rated. ?just because it's zagat rated doesn't mean anything. ? another thing i don't like is the way the seats are set up. ?it's really hard to get a table and parking in the area is difficult. ? i don't normally venture into the north side (aka hipster brooklyn) because i don't like hipsters and there's just nothing there that interests me. ?it's filled with non-native new yorkers trying to make williamsburg into something it's not. ? it took me a few years to venture back into williamsburg after visiting Sea a few years ago and it will take me another few years before i return. sorry fette sau, i really wanted to like you, but you really disappointed me.

I'm not going to ruin the high reviews of this place because I'm a vegetarian. It did make for an awkward ordering experience though. "Can I have two orders of broccoli, some potato salad and a beverage?" I literally got stares from three servers all at once. Anyways, they have a bar with nice cheap wine and pricey soda (da fuck). I remember the line was at least 30-40 people deep when we went. Sweet Jesus, I wish I ate meat. Love the smell of this place. It honestly feels like a community barbecue in someone's backyard.

First of all, though I am from Texas, I am in no way a connoisseur of BBQ and/or meats. Sorry to disappoint. I am, however, a strict and critical judge of good tasting food. And good tasting food can be found at Fette Sau. I went on a really cold evening a few weeks ago, no line, and no shortage of seats and/or food. We sampled a little bit of everything. I loved the Brisket and the Berkshire St Louis Style Pork Ribs. I did not care for the Berkshire Sausage, the texture was weird to me, perhaps I am not used to fennel as a sausage ingredient. The sides that impressed me the most were the broccoli salad and pickles. I absolutely LOVED Cora's Broccoli Salad - no mayo, just tangy and garlicky goodness! ?Guss' Half-Sour Kosher Pickles are so delectable, light with just enough flavor to balance out the heaviness of your meal. The sides that impressed me least were the potato salad and beans.The potato salad was different, again, no mayo (hate mayo!) and it tasted good, just wished the potato slices were cut into chunks to make it easier to eat. I liked the Burnt End Baked Beans - well, I love burnt anything, really, but they were a little on the salty/heavy side for me. I also had the key-lime pie tart, which was good, but pretty tart. Dad's root beer was awesome. And most of their beers are pretty solid. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place looking for some good BBQ in New York.

Pork-tacular. I can't think of a more appropriate description for this place. Be prepared to wait, be prepared to stalk people, hovering over them until they vacate their spot at the table, but most of all, be prepared to feast. The meats are indescribably flavorful, moist, and delicious. And while they are of much lesser consequence (except to my vegetarian friends), the sides are actually phenomenal. Actually, the divine baked beans have meat in them, so maybe the vegetarians should probably just steer clear. The broccoli salad is really only necessary if you feel bad for stuffing yourself with meat, but the baked beans and potato salad hold their own against the meats. And among the meats, the brisket and pork shoulder are not to be missed. Tip: while you're waiting, send someone from your group to the bar for some beer -- it's separate from the meat-serving counter, a set-up that is much-appreciated.

What we came for, the meat, was pretty much 5 stars....our 1/2 pound of pulled pork shoulder + 1/2 pound of beef brisket was exactly what we were hoping for: tender, fatty, perfectly charred. Minus one star for the following: --SAUCES: the darker, spicy BBQ sauce wasn't very good; the plain one was delicious to me, though probably not for anyone who prefers the very tangy stuff, as this was on the sweeter side. --SEATING: this part was kind of a pain in the ass. I knew about the long lines, but to top it off with a bunch of assholes trying to rope off their own group table for 40 minutes or hawk them from others before they've even ordered is just plain annoying. --SIDES: baked beans were not particularly special; I think anyone who enjoys the brown sugar flavor of your usual beans will also agree. Also the sausage was unremarkable...way too peppery-tasting. Overall, this place was excellent. Both my boyfriend and I come from the Deep South, and we were highly satisfied with our experience: at last, we've found a place to fulfill our cravings. Carnivores, welcome to heaven and prepare to leave this place feeling like a complete fat-ass pig.

Fette Sau is one of the best dining experiences to be had in Williamsburg... and if you're a New Forker, this is a must go. You know you're in for a treat when you can smell the smokers going blocks away!!! You can literally navigate to this spot through your sense of smell, as it will get stronger the closer you get (A LA MARCO POLO WITH YOUR NOSE). And once you arrive and see the line out to the street... its definitely time to treat yourself. And trust me... it's worth the wait. There is some strategy here if you want the best cuts and avoid the lines. A: Get there early... a nice 530 6 o'clock dinner never hurt anyone. B: If you do wind up in line (and you will) be with a group (I recommend 4) stake out a table get the seats with the three and 1 waits on line (alternate) and have the seated bring you a beer on line. Price: Buying by the pound definitely gives you the option of trying everything on the menu... Huge +. The prices per pound are not that bad considering the labor intensity of delicious smoked meats. Eating a meal that you wont wake up from will run you about $35 to $40 for 2. Menu: You can smell it! Fette Sau mixes some BBQ staples like pulled pork, pork and beef ribs, and brisket and throws a mix of lesser consumed delicious parts like pork belly, cheeks, etc. Additionally, staple sides with twists round out there menu. No sauce on the meats... just smoked awesomeness, the sauce is up to you with a choice of five at the table. Atmosphere: In an old steel garage, Fette Sau is that beautiful sit down at a bench with the rest of the riff raff. Looking at your cuts of meat on the wall from the chop chart and watching the yule log burn (on an LCD) makes you feel like you're there for Christmas BBQ. Bar in the back has a top notch assortment of different whiskeys, and there is a beer for everyone (meat cleaver taps are an excellent touch). Bar stools are old school wrought iron and are oddly enough comfortable. Big Benches for seating in a crowded garage filled with BBQ, Amazing place. Service: Guys at the meat counter are extremely friendly and will give you choice cuts (iff you want a fattier or leaner piece, just ask them, or don't complain) ask them for a bunch of rolls too, nothing better than making mini sandwiches out of the meats. They take their time and I think they get a kick out of watching you drool over the counter. Cashiers are friendly and will give you what you need. Bar tenders are awesome and will go over the different whiskeys for you and pour you a nice beer in a mason jar. ? Suggestions: OOOOOOO MAN!!!! some of the most deliciously smoked meats make you feel like you're sinning at the table!!! The Brisket is off the meter. I've read some people complain about the fat content of the brisket, but I've had nothing but lean cuts here dripping delicious juice, and you can feel free to request lean cuts when they are slicing it to order... The Beef Ribs are also off the hook.... And if you're lucky to have the sirloin tips.... MONEY!!! As far as Pork is concerned... the pulled pork is pretty damn tasty and it's not swimming in bbq sauce or vinegar (that's up to you at the table). Pork ribs literally fall off the bone... no need to bit, just huff and puff this little piggy. The pork belly is simply amazing (must like fat for this one). Sides: The sides are a bit pricey for my liking, but they totally make this meal! The beans are the highlight of this one! Burnt crispy ends of all those delicious meat are mixed in with these baked pieces of gold... Potato Salad is nice and light, lots of flavor here. This should be sufficient to send you into a food coma. High Point: Amazing meal with good people. You can probably get full off of the smell alone. A nice buzz and you're probably taking some home with you. Low Point: No matter how much you struggle, can't get off the bench. Sleep over and start again I say!

One of the ironies of NYC is that the biggest BBQ chain is called "Dallas," where I lived, tried the BBQ, and I can write without hesitation that this place is better than anywhere I'd ever been in Dallas. This place was truly a revelation when I started eating there more than three years ago, and I ate something called pork belly for the first time, and was a revelation still on my latest visit last week. Everything got better. The boneless beef ribs were a new item to me, and a must-have. So were the beans. We also had pork belly, pork ribs, and broccoli salad; about $60 for two, and we had a little left over. Now let's consider the booze. Pricey? No worse than anywhere else. A super-special rye was $14 and pints were around $6. The selection and expertise behind it was terrific. Props to Alex the bartender for great advice and pulling awesome tunes. This latest visit was a great social experience, too. Mimsye and me met two other couples and we all went bowling. Woo hoo! Incidentally, Texas BBQ that comes close is in Houston (Goode & Co.) and Austin (Rudy's). A lot of foreign tourists make their way to Fette Sau and I'd say they're getting as good or better than anything in Texas.

Epic food. The ribs were amazing, everything could be eaten w/ knife and fork (not that that's how you should eat them)... The sauces were great too. A combo of the vinegar + sweet BBQ made everything better. Had the brisket, short ribs, and baby back ribs w/ baked beans on the side. Very very happy. Worth the $ and schlep from Manhattan.

I apologize that this review has been roasting and marinating for almost 2 years, while yelp has been telling me to finish it. Good things last to those who wait for the dry rub to kick in. Fette Sau, which describes how I feel when I leave (FAT ASS PIG), is an amazing carnivores wet dream full of pig and cow seasoned carcasses to satisfy your caveman obsession. I once saw, The Fonz there with his family eating sausages and brisket. I didn't bother him cause even the Fonz needs to eat sausage in peace. The lines are long and the beer is good. Order a pint while you wait in line and if you are brave get moonshine to shine your liver. In term of my favorite go to meat, I am a huge fan of their espresso rubbed brisket and ribs! They also have special meat on Thursdays, like veal, lamb, and other limited quantities of awesome. Don't forget to finish off your heart attack with a side of delicious 'burnt dripping' beans.

Is Fette Sau good? Yes. Is it the best BBQ in New York? Probably. Is it as good as "real" BBQ? No. But it's close. I'm a "barbecue snob," if such a thing exists, and while Fette Sau is one of very few places in Brooklyn that I don't avoid, it still doesn't compare to the best spots in Texas--or even in Kansas or North Carolina. Take all your east coast and west coast friends, but don't bring your high school buddy, because he'll be able to tell right away. That being said, it's still tasty. The brisket is probably the best thing they do--the fat is delicious--but you can't really go wrong. And it's complemented by ice big craft beer selection (you can buy beer by the gallon if you've got a big group!). You have to wait in a long line--and it can be a pain to find a place to sit. It's true that this is annoying. But show me a barbecue place where it's easy to find a seat and I'll show you a crappy barbecue place. And while Fette Sau doesn't come up to my standards, it's definitely not crappy.

It's a very causal place, you line up, pick your choice of meat, which was paid for per pound and you seat yourself where-ever you find seating. There's a bar with a good selections of beer and wine that you can also eat it but beware of the extra crowding at the bar area if you choose to eat there because there will always be a crowd trying to get a refill on their beer. Now to the food... the pork belly is the die for! (literally with the layer of fat) but it's so delicious! Iwe went with a fellow Texan and he gave a thumbs up. if he gives a thumbs up to this place then it MUST be good! Now we have our very own Texan bbq in our own little niche in brooklyn =) PS: ten thumbs up for the cold slaw and baked beans.

They get four stars because of the meat taste...not the sides. I only had the pork belly. Ok I was in the mood for BBQ since it was the Fourth of July and no one invited me to a BBQ (it's ok, I understand *sniff*) So i looked on yelp to see what I could make happen and came upon a few places, but I decided on this place because of Doug G's review citing this place better than Texas. That's some serious boasting there, so I had to get inside. i arrived there twenty to five and already there was a line. I thought, "good Lord i am glad I got here early" and slid in where I fit in. I nearly passed the place as the sign was not lit since it was closed and the sun was still out, AND it is mad inconspicuous! I would have never guessed that the place that looks like somebody's garage and driveway behind chains and a wire fence was it!!! But it was! Thank God for my Gps on iphone which was reliable for once. smh anyway, I waited online with my friend and the line got longer. we finally were let in and i felt like a part of the cattle. Maybe that should have been my first clue as to what this would be like. I was about 5 or 6th in line and looked at the prices and nearly fell down. Geeze louise 18 bucks a pound for pork belly? 24 a pound for this and that?! Geeze no wonder the guy in front of us just spent 53.99 for what looked like he and another person. I didn't have that on me but neither did I want to after i walked in. Now I fought with myself because of this. I really wanted to give this place three stars and the three would be due to the meat taste but I had to be reaonable here. This was a place for pork. But I kid you NOT, the place smelled like death when i walked in. Now again, this may be because I am eating different things daily in my diet but I am not averse to the good old pork now and then. Betimes the sow is my best friend come holidays like thanksgiving and Christmas. But THIS- STANK! I would have swore a few just went into the slaughter before we walked in there and I am just saying this made me want to head for the exit, head of the line or no, ( and the line was out past the gate by the time we got in). The inside was dark and cool and most people had a partner scout a seat for them at the long tables while another waited in line to order. My friend made the mistake of sitting right by the line. Big no no for me as i hate people watching my food while i eat and they wait. They are hungry for crying out loud! The line and the table he sat at were too close to each other. The man who served was able to explain the system is by weight and I asked for very little of the pork belly. He gave me less than 1/4 lb and a side of mac and cheese. I paid about 12 and change with my card there and sat at the table my friend picked out. I decided to move to the outside tables despite the heat but the line was less bothersome for some reason there. maybe because it was so hot no one was really focused on me. There were no condiments outside so i missed out on using their BBQ sauce. The meat was bleeding grease on the wax paper they placed it on, on my tray. I moved it to a plate and bit it. It was charred to perfection and i enjoyed the taste. There was a flavor to it that showed it was well seasoned. Perhaps with the sauce it would have been crazy. But with all that grease I wanted to pace myself. I bit into the last bite and literally "bled" grease out my lips like i had a water balloon in my mouth and the water came out when I chomped down. But what do you expect, it is pork. Everyone was getting drinks served in jars and had large glass jugs reminiscent of something a dude with a wheat grass stuck in between his teeth would be in possession of. (Ah stereo types, shm). Now if you've ever had the mac and cheese from Amy Ruth's you would know why I could not stand the mac and cheese here. It was cheesy, yes, but it lacked the seasoning flavor I have been spoiled with by Amy Ruth;s and It was extremely filled more with grease than flavor. I could not wait to get out of there and so I did. The meat I had tasted good, but I am in not haste to go back to this place. Perhaps I will stomach going back one day, but if I am in need good mac I will go else where. Only the pork would I try and if I do make it here another time, i will try only the meat and it will be the pulled pork and the ribs- and i'll take it to go!

From the outside, it looks like you may be walking into a Auto repair shop and when you walk to the back expect to see a greasy handed mechanic. Instead I smiled as I look around at a rustic space, with benches and interesting decor. The smell as soon as you walk in is intoxicating!!! The bar has beer tap handles made out of BBQ utensils (cute!) with a good selection of beers. On the large wall inside there is a mural of the parts of the pig and cow. It can be a lot to take in when you see all of the choices there are; beef brisket, pulled pork, ribs, sausages, and more! The staff was very helpful in figuring out how to order. You order by the pound; both exciting and slightly overwhelming. The coleslaw was fantabulous, with a refreshing flavor. Baked beans were delicious and addicting. The buns were great with the meat and sauces... I created little sliders. This is a very chill place to enjoy delicious BBQ, some beer, and the company of friends on a nice sunny day (option to eat outside in front, however in the summer the sun can be a bit too much to handle). Parking is pretty easy to find around the corner. I will be back!!!

I am truly puzzled by the good reviews. ?Everything here had the same cloying overly-sweet sauce on it, including the sides, so there was no break for the palate. Even the COLESLAW had the same sickeningly sweet taste, so there was no balancing out the overly fatty meats. We left feeling sick....I felt like I had goo stuck in my throat for days afterward. Expensive, for what it is, too, at $15-$20/lb. Service was also terrible as the grub was served up by laconic, indifferent hipsters who didn't care at all about fielding questions about the cuts and they really didn't know anything when you could get them to answer, anyway. It's every man for himself. I could easily forgive this if the food were good. We know good BBQ and have had the best in TX and NC while visiting my brother and sisters there. Too bad Pearson's in LIC closed or we'd go there. This, I remember, was an awesome BBQ place.

Have been to Fette Sau various times. It is a great spot for the warm days, not so much for the cold days, due to the limited indoor seating. A few things you must know prior to visiting this place: The meat choices aren't always the same, so if you love pork belly and are in the mood for Fette Sau's specifically, or are looking to enjoy their amazing flank steak, you're taking a chance -same goes for finding seats. The line is long every time I've visited. Expect to wait anywhere between 30-45 minutes before you can order. Oh and they've ran out of our preferred meats maybe 2 people before we made it to our turn to order. It does take some work to be able to enjoy their yummy, juicy, tasty meats accompanied by their great beer selection. As many have said here, they need to work on their selection of sides . After trying all of them the first time I visited, I haven't ordered any again.

This place is not just bbq, it is an experience and it is a test of self. Go with patience and friends with whom you enjoy talking with, because it is guaranteed you will have to wait at the very least 30 minutes on a popular day/night. While you wait on the line that hugs the walls you should order a beer or mixed drink from the bar which they serve in jam jars. Catch up with your friends while you eye the days meat options written on chalk boards as you inch towards the cashier. Order by weight, get served on a lunch tray and then hope to find a seat. Experienced patrons know to double team and while one orders the food the other scouts a couple of inches to squeeze into at one of the several long communal picnic style tables that ?fill the room. Delicious pulled pork, ribs and brisket. The meat is totally worth the wait/weight. You will not leave hungry.

Great spot for Brisket and Pulled Pork. ?This place is no secret so the line can get fairly long. ?My friend and I will come here on off days or at off times and there can still be a fairly long line. ?But they have a pretty solid beer and whiskey menu to enjoy while you wait. The Brisket and Pulled Pork are amazing. ?The sausage is good but not great. ?The spareribs were very tasty but the ones that I've tried haven't been loaded with meat. ?It's fun to load up and try the various meats but it can and will get expensive. My only real complaint lies in the sides. ?The beans are good but they're over $5 for a small order. ?There's no starch side like mashed or baked potatoes. ?There is a potato salad option but I am not a fan of potato salad. I try to get here every few months and thoroughly enjoy it when I do despite the small complaints. ?If you have yet to try Fette Sau, go try it.

I don't normally travel to Brooklyn, but as a dedicated fan of great BBQ, I was willing to take a trip out to the land of the hipsters (Williamsburg) to try out Fette Sau, a place that many people claim to be the best BBQ place in New York. ?After consuming a couple pounds of BBQ and several beers on a Sunday afternoon, I can safely say that Fette Sau is one of the top places in NYC for BBQ, but only for specific types of meat. ? Overall, Fette Sau has some of the best pork I've ever had -- the pulled pork, bacon, pork belly, and pork spare ribs were all exceptional. ?The beef was solid, but varied greatly -- the brisket was among the best I've had (Hill Country moist brisket still reigns supreme), but the short ribs were way too tough for my tastes. ?The spicy pork sausage was good, but the flavor profile didn't fit in with the rest of the smoked meats. ? Sides were very good - go for the cole slaw, which has an Asian flavor to it (sesame oil) and the potato salad. ?Even on Sunday afternoons (we got here at 4pm), the wait is a good 35-40 minutes, so be prepared to wait for your food. for pictures: ?http://www.thegluttonous

Fette Sau...I left there feeling like a FAT SOW and DID NOT CARE! ?Listen up...if you visit over the weekend, DO NOT, I say, DO NOT be deterred by the long line. ?It is WELL worth the wait!! Food so good you don't even need the sauce...LAWD HAVE MERCY! ?I'm salivating as I think about it a day later. ?Brisket, check, SLAMMIN'! ?RIBS, check, SLAMMIN'! ?Pork Shoulder, check, SLAMMIN'! ?And those beans...I was making yummy bean sandwiches with those rolls. ?I have no words to describe this eating experience. ? So in summation, bring your behind to BK, specifically Willie B and sit down to a huge azz helping of meat with some awesome sides. ? P.S. Ladies, don't come here on a date trying to be all cute. ?You will fail miserably...just saying, you've been warned.

I was excited to come here, but was slightly underwhelmed. The decor is great - you stand in a line, grab a tray, dump all sorts of BBQ on it, and then you sit on huge picnic tables. We tried the ribs, pulled pork, and the baked beans. Unfortunately, the ribs were on the dry side. Don't know if we'll be back.

I ate here with two barbeque snobs from Tennessee. We smiled knowingly at the precious Brooklyn atmosphere and the high-ish numbers on the cash register. We took our food back to our table and ate it in complete silence. One of my dining companions looked up and drawled (a little sadly) "Man. I wanted to hate on this place so bad." Delicious - whoever cooks obviously has some strong opinions about how barbeque should taste, and knows how to execute them when cooking the meat and choosing/preparing the sauces. Sides are alright, but honestly I wouldn't bother - just order a big plate of tasty, enchanting meat. I'm fond of the service you get here, too - you can tell the people serving the meat how hungry you are and how many people you are feeding, and they will pleasantly and accurately direct you.

I ordered catering to pick up for my wife's surprise birthday party from Jake at Fette Sau. 5 lbs each of various meats and potato salad were ready for pick up at the time requested, nicely packaged for easy transport. The food was raved about by most, if not all of our 25-30 guests. You WILL have customers coming to your place as a result. The prevailing comments were, "if the food is this good (and you picked it up 2 hours ago), can you imagine how good it must be when you eat AT the place!" Thank you Jake and Fette Sau for making the food at the party one less thing to worry about and one more thing to talk about.

When it comes to BBQ I am as picky as a New Yorker has a right to be. Having eaten in some of the BBQ meccas (Texas, the Carolinas, hell even wild boar on a spit in northern Italy)I'm aware that BBQ is not something we often do well or consistantly and ?I've accepted this about my home Hill Country has been my go-to barbeque spot and Fette Sau has a few somewhat superficial things in common with it. You buy your meat by the pound at both places. Both use rubs more than slathering sauces. Both hold brisket in it's rightful place as most important thing to get right. While Hill Country seems like a New Yorker's bad attempt at looking like a Texas smokehouse, Fette Sau revels in its all the eclectic charms of Williamsburg. Perhaps you might say - ?even some of the hipster douchiness, but stay with me; this place is five kinds of epic. Some foodie friends invited me out knowing how I feel about meat. I like it. I like it a lot. I'd heard good things about Fette Sau so when I arrived at the converted auto mechanic's garage and found a line of intensely hungry people with sweating jars of beer in their hands waiting for food I got in line and started imagining. The place is charming in it's Samford & Son aesthetic and as I got to the counter I saw two women who looked like roller-derby bruisers (hot, tattood, muscled) expertly distributing meat. The brisket was simply the best brisket I've ever had, Maybe life altering The fat was caramelized and the meat had the most perfectly tender almost sticky texture. The flavor was intensely rich with a slight sweetness and a saltiness that amplified that richness. There was not much smokiness there, but that's actually a plus to me. Smoke, like spiciness, is pretty easy to do and if not done right just masks other flavors. This was perfect. I saw someone across the way putting some sauce on this brisket and I almost jumped over the table and smacked the bottle out of their hand. Then again I was in the throws of some kind of "meat haze" by then so I wasn't fully in control of my faculties. The pork belly was a fatty salty treat. Somewhere between a thick slab of bacon and a pork loin, it was all at once decadent and simple. It's a little much to have a lot of, but as a small taste of it was perfect. Don't get more than a quarter pound. I think if I had the pulled pork some other time I would have been thrilled by it. On a little roll with some of the excellent coleslaw and a bit of the BBQ sauce it was delicious probably in the top five in the city, but it was so overshadowed by how amazing the brisket was that I was wishing I didn't waste the plate space. The beans were spectacular. If I can again compare this to Hill Country, which also has some burnt ends of brisket in it, there were a far richer and sweeter baked bean than the "cowboy" style at Hill Country. The coleslaw was interesting with bits of cabbage, coleslaw and even peppers, though next time I might skip all vegetables and just see how much brisket I can fit inside of my mouth without dying. The beer selection was awesome with eight microberews served in jam jars or jugs. I was quiet happy with a quart of a very hoppy southern IPA but was shocked at how good the Manhattans my co-pigs had ordered. They had a bunch of great bourbons and other whiskeys as well as some good looking wines and interesting mixed drinks. They also had some great old fashion sodas which I would have tried but by the time I noticed them I was teetering on explosion. Fette Sau is not someplace to go that often. It's rich and complex and wonderful. It's like bone marrow, tough to dig out but worth it if you know how to enjoy a delicacy. Sure, you have to wait in line, hunt for a seat, juggle plates and beer as the smells drive you insane with hunger. Yet it's all part of the plan, because when you finally do it sit down your mouth is dripping with saliva and when that first bit of slightly charred, salty, sticky, delicious meat hits your mouth everything fades away and there is only bliss. It is transcendent dining. In the end Fette Sau exemplifies something that love about New York. We are a city which for the most part considers itself the antithesis of the south and yet our namesake drink (the Manhattan) is made with bourbon. We are a city of strong characters and strong egos, but we will put them aside when it comes to quality. Fette Sau is quality dining.

If you are a BBQ connoisseur then you will love love love this place! ?Their selection changes weekly based on what's good and available. ?Their pulled pork is fantastic and leaves you wanting more for days following. ?I love the atmosphere and the overall fun of this place. ?I agree with several other reviewers that they don't give you enough rolls and having to pay for extra is annoying, but worth it. ? Tip - get here early otherwise you will be waiting for a long time and your stomach will hate you as you are engulfed in the aromas of deliciousness.

After 21 years of being a vegetarian I have taken up the task of eating the flesh of dead animals again. ? And it's GREEEATTT!!!! So of course I had to go here to check out the bbq'ed flesh. I really have no reference point since I've been a non meat eater for so long, but my fiancee tells me that their "Q" is pretty darn tasty...and I thought it was good, esp the brisket..... but again I have no reference point for comparison. I was a fan of making little sandwiches with the rolls and douching them with the spicy bbq sauce. YUM. Just a bit too much meat for me to dive into being new to the flesh consumption game. "My body was like, WTF is all this shit you're putting into me???!!! Your colon is soo pissed at you right now!!! " I don't find myself craving to go back, but maybe that will change once I try some other BBQ places. The find your own bench to eat thing is kind of annoying, but you just gotta go at the right time and avoid the lunch/dinner rush. Thank you pretty animals for sacrifing your lives so that we, the dominant apex predators may enjoy your tasty arms and legs and ribs and breasts and chests and stuff.

Porky-porky:))I have to say that I've looked forward this bbq joint for quite sometimes since I've watched it being praised on so many TV shows... I had a small selection of ribs,pulled pork,pork belly,brisket and sausage,along with some sauerkraut and pickles.I'm not gonna lie that they were the best I ever had cause it won't be the truth,but they were good.The sauerkraut was proven to be uncooked which as a bit wired when it comes as a side dish,should have been cooked.The pickles very mediocre,the ribs were average as well...the pork belly would have been a hit if it wasn't for the 85% pure fat which was not so pleasant to eat,there is for we left it there... So for the originality of the place I'll rate 4 stars,the food itself maybe 3... just visited Texas before I came to NYC and eaten quite some bbq across the stare,so it will take a while to find the bbq perfection that good old Texas had offered me...

Really wanted to like this place... heard a lot of great things about it... but the barbecue was only slightly above average and the overall experience was pretty horrible. First thing to know: ?Expect a long, slow-moving line. The first time we came here, we waited roughly an hour until it became very clear that the line was moving so slowly that in another hour when the kitchens closed we still wouldn't have food. ?(This isn't necessarily a negative for a restaurant - they have a right to serve at whatever pace they like, but it raises strong questions as to whether the food is worth the wait.) Second thing: When you finally do get food... though there will be tons of places to sit, don't expect to get one. They will all be jealously puppyguarded by hipsters holding them for their friends waiting in line, still 30 minutes from the counter. ? I'm going to repeat myself ?to underscore how frustrating this is: 50% or more of the seats will be open. You won't be able to sit at any of them. I almost got into a fight with two guys who were, without food, ?"holding" seats for eight, had been doing so for at least 20 minutes, and wouldn't let us use the space though their friends were still stuck in line. I thought this was unacceptable, and called one of them an A-hole. He thought THAT was unacceptable... ?I think it was a fear of losing his miserly grip on the table that prevented anything from escalating. Long story short: We took our platter, silverware, sauce and walked out the door, to the park down the block. The food was good, but not great... Dinosaur Barbecue is probably better, and a train ride to Harlem seems like a walk down the block compared to the hassle involved in eating here. Smoke Joint in Fort Greene is a bit less inspired than this place but close to as good and relatively effortless to acquire.

Fatty; So? I'm starting off negative, just to warn you. ?If you show up hungry, its hard not to get frustrated by the "service." ?The people working there are nice, but getting to them is tricky. ?The separate food and beverage is off putting. ?The line for the food can be out the door almost to the sidewalk (and possibly beyond, at peak times). ?No clear sign of what's on the menu, no wait list or order to the table-claiming "system," crowded almost all the time. ?You finally get to the food counter and you order by weight, which is sort of cool, but ordering ribs means paying for the weight of the bones you won't be eating. ?It's been a half and hour of standing on line, you just want anything to eat at this point, you over order because god help you if you under order and have to wait on line again. ?I came with 2 other people and ordered 4 meats, 4 sides. ?$100 of food on one trey. ?Then there's a tip jar...... why? ?I did all the service. ?What's fair? Am I a jerk if I stiff you? ?How well are you paid? ?Hunger makes me crazy, irritable, cranky and generally quick to judge negatively. ? Mind you, this is specifically a chronicle of my 8th visit or so. ?I already know this place is good, and still this is the way the experience is unfolding. ? In other words, I knew what to expect going in this time around. ?But you DO have a lot of time to think while standing in line. Then you finally get a seat (teamwork helps- send one for drinks, one to claim a seat as you near the food-ordering station), sit down, grab a rib, and take a bite.... "Oh, right, that's why I keep coming back. " It becomes a "yes sir, may I have another" type situation. ?The food is so good, the BBQ so exquisite, the torture it takes to get to it becomes desirable. ?If the service was better, this place would be EVEN BUSIER. ?I don't want to think of that. ?This meat is so well-seasoned, perfectly smoked/charred, the bbq sauce on the tables so above average that I'll be back again and again and again. ? Don't change anything! ?Just open more locations! ?Food trucks, maybe? ?We can only hope, but I feel as though a 5 minute wait might reduce the effect this food has on the consumer. ?The anticipation really makes the food taste better, its hard to admit.

Wow it's a lot of meat!!!! Everything was good and super meaty.... Shamefully admitting, I am a well done eater but by far, the best BBQ place I've been to (and I ate lots of tri tip sandwiches and shredded porks). Porks and beef were juicy and definitely melts in your mouth! Order kale and beans side because they're delicious!!! Perfect combination after each meaty bites.

Food : Mind-blowing meat. ?The pork belly was the best I have had. ?The brisket was great too. ?The sausage was ok (better than most places but not a fan of the fennel). ?The pork chops were not good - dry and not juicy. ?The pulled pork was tasty - smoked with great flavor. ? I didn't need the sauce but a bunch of people in our party loved the sauce too. Drink : Standard drink menu. ?As expected. Decor : Biergarten atmosphere which is perfect for the type of food. ?You stand in a line, order your food by the pound and then move towards an empty bench. ? Service : No waiter service which is perfectly fine. ?The staff cleans up empty tables. ?Counter service could probably be hastened but not a big pain point. Overall : Go there for the meat and definitely get the belly and brisket. ?Its a place that's definitely worth a visit to feed your meat addiction. ?Few better places. ?Its in Brooklyn so a bit of a hike - but the L line is very close.

Good BBQ. ?Home made sauces are a plus. ?Not the best I've ever had, but I like it every time I go. ?Never been disappointed. ?Sides are tastey, but a bit oily. ?Good tap selection. ?Local Brooklyn breweries well represented. ?Six point makes them a special beeer only available there. ?Good cocktails & whiskey selection. ?Go early as it fills up and the wait can be too long for what is delivered. ?A Little pricey, but you'll have that in Williamsburg. ?Great place for a big meal or quick snack and drink.

I was invited to this joint, 2 hours from home. I made the trip on the reputation of the meat. The meat did not disappoint, flavorful and smoky. At 3 on a Sunday they still had ribs and pork butt, pork sausage and pork cheeks, short ribs, brisket. That was the highlight. Is that enough? The wait was about 1 hour. Really long and slow, purposefully so. They have one very purposeful young man dispensing meats to your tray, by the pound. The other guy at the counter stands and chats idly while adding pickles and rolls to your order. Too long and slow. They could add to the line and double the pace, but that might be as hipster as making people wait on-line. The bar attached to the counter is cutesy but at equal space with the food counter, which was unjustified. The selection of local beer on-tap makes up for the somber bar wench, but not the use of space. The sides were slider rolls, vinegar-based potato salad, and delicious beans. The beans were above average.The other sides are pedestrian. Tables are picnic table; homey chic and locale is BBQ charming. Food and beer were near perfect. Price, and process ?less than ideal.

ATMOSPHERE- It felt very informal with dim lighting indoors and benches and tables outdoors. The decor resembled that of a field trip experience. Meanwhile, servers behind the counter look at you in disgust if you are not ready to place your order or if you have questions pertaining to their menu like so, "I can't tell you about our selection sir. There's a line. It's all on our menu." Food- Ordering meat by pounds, plates filled up for carnivorous appetites. Interestingly enough, an order that does not look fullfilling becomes a plethora when actual consumption occurs. The ribs consisted of heavy weighing bones. The other meats had some fat in it which made them juicy. Broccoli and mediocre tasting potato salad sides come cold and unfortunately, unknowingly shocking for Winter. OVERALL - More of a meat-lovers fieldtrip eatery with very informal settings and servers who glance at you with contempt for not knowing what to order. Great idea with a bar and a car garage eatery but the customer service demoted their 4 stars down to 3 stars. Unfortunate.

Went here for my birthday back in February, and while I really liked it, it wasn't the OMG BBQ experience I wanted it to be. I suppose that's an unfair expectation to put on any restaurant, but that was the general consensus that I was getting from people who had been here. Let me state that while I loved the brisket, ribs, and sausage, none of them brought me to that state where I wanted to eat there every day. I've felt that at one, maybe two other places. If I'm so 'meh' on the place, why give it four stars? They're efficient, they have a great selection of beer and bourbon, and in spite of the lines and lack of seating, somehow a group of 12 was seated and ate comfortably. This is good food, done well by people who know what they're doing.

Fette Sau i have to say you were worth the wait in line. While in line you should eye people who are leaving and quickly grab a spot. I love that they sell beer and they serve it in jugs and you drink right out of mason jars. Your dry rub ribs are spectacular. I'm not a fan of dry rub and thought I would need to slather bbq sauce on it but no I devoured the ribs, brisket and sausage. I love that you serve bbq with potato bread. Your beans are so good it makes my mouth water just thinking about my meal.

Um, yeah. ?So I really like meat. ?And I may have actually made the trek into Williamsburg with some friends to get 7 lbs of meat. ?And baked beans and pickles and broccoli and coleslaw and rolls. ?Did I mention 7 lbs of meat? ?Oh yeah, and three handles of beer. ? This was pretty delicious. ?So people totally know the meat is delicious (stick with the tried and true bbq - pulled pork, pork belly, beef brisket, etc - wasn't a huge fan of the pork chop, but got it for the "experience"), but surprisingly, there's also a huge amount for the vegetarian diner (although, why would you go to a bbq place if you are vegetarian). ?This broccoli was some of the best broccoli that I have had, and the coleslaw was not your normal coleslaw. ?Flavor was amazing, and the apples (yes, apples were great in the coleslaw) made the crunch awesome :) Beer is great, and everything is served in little mason jars, so it's also super cute. ?Downside is the line - if you get there any time during a normal dinner hour on a weekend, you have to wait forever. ?Although if you have a lot of friends that get there before you and get a table and wait in line for beer and meat so that when you get there you can just sit down and eat (yeah, that happened), you are set.

My boyfriend and I arrived around 2pm on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend. I was expecting a line considering the holiday, but was pleasantly surprised when there was virtually no line and some seating inside the building. We order 1/4 lb of everything they had on the menu at that time - total of 1 1/4 lb of food to split. Our plate included: pork shoulder, pork belly, brisket, ribs and sausage. We got one side of black beans which was meat filled and amazing. The only BBQ I have had in New York City previously was at Southern Hospitality (terrible) and Blue Smoke (fantastic). The BBQ served at Fette Sau easily beats them both and to be fair Blue Smoke is pretty damn great. They change their menu throughout the day (we saw steaks available after we ordered). As everything we had was so amazing I would like to go back to see what else they have in store. The prices are steep, but you don't need to tip for a server (unless you order a drink at the bar) and everything is well worth the cost. The atmosphere is very relaxed. We sat at the bar which is well stocked with beer and whiskey. The bartender was attentive, but didn't rush us at all. My boyfriend noticed that she was nice enough to provide 2 small beer samples to a patron who was undecided. They also offer their beers in 1/2 pints which is perfect if you want to sample many of the 10 taps they have available. I gave Fette Sau 5 stars, cause I don't have a single reason to give it one star less. Enjoy their BBQ and if there's a wait - trust me it's worth it. One suggestion - I think we made the right call by going early afternoon on a Sunday. Most people are eating brunch at this time. Eat BBQ instead!

Fette Sau makes life better. Being from the Midwest (about an hour from Kansas City), I take barbecue pretty seriously. I grew up attending barbecue competitions and restaurants all over the area, and know how good it can be. Most places in the Northeast have been vast disappointments. Until I went to Fette Sau. Seriously the best BBQ in New York that I've had, and could probably stand up against some of the best in the midwest. Also, you can buy beer by the gallon. Go. Get in line (it moves faster than it seems). Get your food and rolls. Get a beer. Make a mess. Enjoy great BBQ.

Let me just start off by saying that people here are too freaking gorgeous and styling, and it seriously pisses me off. I love stuffing my fat face with their BBQ but dread looking at all the hot folks that make me feel like a total fugly fat ass. I swear there was a table of models one Sunday I was there, and all I wanted to do while I waited on their long counter line was to choke each one of them and scream, "You're freaking models! You're not suppose to be eating BBQ! That's the one reason why I can live with myself!" Ok...and so anyway, nonetheless, Fette Sau is pretty awesome. It's a bit expensive. They have the market by-the-pound pricing, similar to Hill Country (except HC started offering combos). The average dinner price for a meal of 2 meats, a side, and a drink is around $20-25. Not exactly the place you go for a cheap meal. The little meat counter where you line up to order your food is manned by one man, maybe two at most, so the wait can be LONG. It took us almost 30 minutes to get to order. So grab a drink at the separate bar and chat up that model behind you. The waitstaff is overall pretty nice and friendly. No complains from the guys at the counter line, but have encountered a few grouchy waitresses and bartenders. The environment is really chill, I love the meat chart wallpapers. It's picnic table style, so don't be a jerk and hoard the towels & sauces. The BBQ is definitely delicious. I am usually not a fan of pulled pork but theirs is so smoky and flavorful. Same goes with the rest of the menu. The pork belly is insane, one portion will satisfy your craving for fat so don't go overboard. The St. Louis ribs are also well seasoned and smoked perfectly. Even though everyone raves about the brisket, it's been very dry the last few times I went. I did, however, love their Black Angus beef that was a special one night. The sides are good. Potato salad is refreshing. Broccoli salad is fresh but the dressing is a little sour for my taste buds. Baked beans with burnt ends is tasty and great for bread dipping. There are an assortment of drinks and you can never go wrong with a cold jar of beer or the Sweet Leaf sweet tea is my personal favorite. I love that they change the menu daily and you never know what new and delicious BBQ meat will be available that day. The specials hardly disappoints and it keeps people coming back. I certainly will be, but definitely when there's less of a crowd.

I'm not sure about you, but when I think barbecue, I think of flavorful rubs, sauces, and marinades. ?I always tend to forget the one crucial ingredient Fette Sau seems to incorporate into every single dish. ?That's tender love....literally. Personally, I like to call it food witchcraft, but in reality, it's just that they cook their meats to perfection. The atmosphere is very Brooklyn-y. ?Unique, homey, and just a tad bit out there. ?We sat at the bar and I immediately noticed they had Doc's Hard Cider on draft. ?It was a delight to see this as I've only seen it in bottles and in draft format only at the actual winery itself. You tend to wait a long time for your food as I'm sure many have already noted on Yelp. ?While my boyfriend waited on line, I found myself sitting at the bar and gaping at the wall paper to pass time. The beer handles were cool too. ?The draft handle lineup consisted of dulled butcher knives, meat cleavers and mallets. The only reason why I deduct 1 star off is for the sauerkraut. ?It was ok....not incredibly tart and juicy tasting as I had anticipated, but for what it lacked in taste, it was incredibly fresh. ?Perhaps, people in the South like to eat it cold, but I'm sorry, if I want to eat it cold I'd rather order a side of coleslaw. Oh and make sure to slather your food in the delish sweet barbecue sauce. ?It's good enough to want to straight up slurp down. I wouldn't make a second pilgrimage just to visit Fette Sau, but if I happen to be in the neighborhood, it's worth stopping in and waiting the 30 mins for such a meat delicacy.

They also have a nice beer selection and amazing whiskey list. ?The decor is simple but just right. ?I found the different butcher knifes used as tap handles for the beer to be quite clever.

Barbecue meats sold by the pound: deliciously greasy pork belly , briskets, ribs. ?Sides like roasted potatoes, baked beans and mac n cheese (which they never seem to have when I've been. ?Still look forward to trying them). ? A bar where you can grab cider beer to wash down your artery-clogging meal. ?After choosing your pickings from the counter, take your tray and sit down in the picnic tables either indoors or outside in Fette Sau, a hipster run, down-home establishment. Your table will have hot sauce and barbecue sauce, and rolls of paper towels to sop off the grease from your chin. ?What the hell is not to love about this place?! ?Okay maybe the price which is a bit high and the abysmally long lines when it's busy-otherwise a good ol' American meal can be had here.

Let it be known that I am a sausage whore. No, seriously, it's my favorite type of meat, and I don't care from which animal; wild boar, venison, beef, chicken, turkey, duck, alligator (yup - it's how we roll in the Bayou), and the illustrious pork - I love you all. The oh-too-brief moments you're in my mouth are the few times in my everyday life I can experience true happiness. Enter Fette Sau - German for 'Fat Pig', this seemed like the perfect place to refuel between stops on the Brooklyn Brews Bar Crawl. The space is basically 3 long picnic tables in an open garage and decorated like a sparse warehouse cafeteria (think chalk boards, meat hooks, bare lightbulbs) complete with a bar serving up their own brewed beer. Because we arrived right when they opened, seating wasn't an issue, but at this first come, first seated joint, you might wanna do what we did if you're a large party by bogarting an entire table to yourselves before the crowds come. (I never entered the 2 bathrooms, so I can't comment on their wheelchair friendliness, but the tables are low enough to not be an issue.) If memory serves me correctly, for two people I ordered; -Two beers: whatever the 'home brand' was what we drank. And it was tasty enough, however the following foods stole the show. -Broccoli Salad: this was vinegar tangy and pretty tasty, but it was purposely cold! From a healthy colon perspective, Mama approves - but this woulda been 10X better warmed up. -BBQ baked beans: I want to be slathered in this, head to toe, for no reason other than my perverse enjoyment. Imagine the best baked beans you ever had in your life. Now add chopped up bits of smoked pork. Then multiply that by a million. Now do you understand why I want to bathe in these beans? -1/3 pound of Pork Ribs: Dry rubbed = heaven. A good rack of ribs never needs sauce, however I used these suckers like little mops to transport the 3 types of bottled sauces on the table into my mouf. Fall off the bone yummy, with lovely smoke rings as an indicator of a quality product. Mama approves. - 1/3 pound of Brisket - Moist, tender and flavorful, with a good char on the outside. I stuffed a couple of slices into the complimentary rolls, doused it all in sauce, and shoveled those sam'iches into my face with the quickness. -and of course...SAUSAGE. Two to be exact; one for him and one for me. But they were sooooooooooooooooo perfectly crispy, yet juicy, spicy, smoky, and tender - *** OH MY SWEET DISPLACED SOUTHERNER STARS *** - I had to get back on line and order 2 more, just for my gluttonous self. Meanwhile, the few Beer Crawl participants who weren't in a food coma at our table were staring at me in fear, as if to say "Did this heffa just eat all that barbeque AND two more sausages?" Why yes I did, honey! And I enjoyed every porktastic bite. Fat Pig, indeed. :::whispers::: I love you, Fette Sau.

I feel like I need to start with a disclaimer here: ?I grew up in New England, which is about as far as you can get on the culinary spectrum from the South. ?In my childhood, "We're having BBQ" meant "How many Hebrew National hot dogs would you like?" ?Which is all to say that there may be some of you out there who would not see me as a fit judge of "real" BBQ. ?But to you I say this: ?I have tastebuds. ?And frankly, they were not all that pleased with Fette Sau. The shining star of the evening was undoubtedly the pork belly--charred on the outside and incredibly sweet and juicy on the inside. ?I almost certainly ate more than my share, and was thankful that my friends were too polite to point out my obvious oinkery. The pulled pork and the brisket paled in comparison--neither reached the level of fatty juiciness of the pork belly, and I found myself continually putting extra sauce on my pulled pork sandwich to moisten it up. ?And I didn't even like the sauce all that much. ? Next, the disappointing sides. ?I know I'm no Southerner, but the few times I have had "real" BBQ, there have always been hot veggie sides and mac & cheese, but Fette Sau offers none. ?The only hot side is their burnt-ends baked beans, which I didn't get to try, but we did have an order each of potato salad and broccoli salad. ?The potato salad was tasty, but I just don't get excited about potato salad, ever. ?And the broccoli "salad" seemed to be nothing but cold steamed broccoli with some red pepper flakes--completely underwhelming, and went mostly uneaten. ?My inner grumpy 5-year old started banging the table in protest, chanting "Mac and Cheese! ?Mac and Cheese!" One thing I feel supremely qualified to comment on is Fette Sau's excellent bourbon selection. ?They've got a robust collection of bottles ranging from the most basic (Rebel Yell) to extra fancy (George T Stagg), and offer tasting flights for whiskey lovers of all levels. ?The prices are a little steep though, especially considering the ultra-casual atmosphere, and despite the crowd at the bar reaching 3 or 4-deep, the bartender was often nowhere to be seen. ? I haven't yet been to Dinosaur, but I have been to Hill Country. ?And though the clientele at Hill Country are decidedly less hip than those at Fette Sau and it requires going above 14th st, I'd still go there again before going back to Fette Sau. ?At least they have mac & cheese.

This place is great. It's got the whole Texas/German BBQ concept happening. You stand in line and get meat by the pound. They have a butcher who cuts and wraps it up for you. With each order you get bread to make sandwiches and they have 3 types of BBQ sauce on the table. The Ribs, Boston Butt, Pork Belly, and Beef Brisket are all delicious. So far I haven't had a cut of meat here that isn't really good. They also have these pretty tasty sausages you can get for $1. if you're not a huge eater and realize that the sides are lame (see below) you can eat here for pretty cheap and if you're with a group that's indecisive, the butcher will just hook you up with a bunch of different meats for a flat rate. I'm a bourbon drinker and this place has a great selection. Bourbon, scotch, and whiskey actually. ?Their bar has the best selection of all 3 that I've seen in the city. The bartenders also have these freakishly large ice cubes just for that. When you order a bourbon on the rocks, they put one in your glass and pour it into this special jigger that fits diagonally over the glass. The bourbon then pours slowly out of the jigger and onto the ice like a golden brown waterfall. (Sniffle) It's so beautiful. -1 star for the picnic table seating. Does anybody like the picnic table seating? If you have more than 1 person with you, you're hovering over people like a punk until someone leaves. Then you got the empty seats you desperately need with jackets or purses or cameras on them. What's that all about? You gotta ask people if someone's sitting there while your friends canvas the room like cops after a prison break. ? Also -1 star for the subpar side dishes. You gotta try harder than that, Fette Sau. The broccoli has a weird vinegar-y aftertaste, the collard greens are pretty lame, and the baked beans are way too tangy. The potato salad is just plain gross.

Real BBQ sold by the pound on a metal tray and butcher paper. Great selection of micro brews, fine whiskeys and great interior design. It is a converted car mechanic (if I recall correctly) Concrete, brick, subway tile, exposed beams and a whole wall covered by hand painted meat cut charts for beef, pork and lamb. The Brisket and pulled pork are amazing. Charred but still moist and falling off the bone due to their long slow cook times. I do have a tip while dining here. Eat your food as soon as it's plated (trayed?) and don't waste time getting beers and whiskey. Go with someone and have them get the drinks ready. The food gets cold quickly on the trays and it is so important to eat it while it's hot.

I'm not a BBQ expert. ?I worked at a BBQ place in Austin years ago, and I like BBQ - that's the extent of my "expertise". ?However, being a native Texan, there is only so much I can bring myself to pay for the stuff here in NYC. ?It's not just the money, it's the principle. ?Also, I prefer it basic, at least up here. ?Nothing too high-falutin', no pretentious "fusions". ?You've got to master walking before you try cartwheels. ? Anyway, I was quite pleased with Fette Sau. ?Their menu featured the usual suspects, much to my relief. ?What I had was great, not just for NYC, but in general. ?Being a condiment fiend, I was impressed with the effort put into the BBQ sauces (yes - plural). ?You order by 1/4 lb. increments, and eat on trays covered with wax paper at communal benches. ?Nice and simple. The prices were reasonable (considering the real estate), and the serving sizes were legit (let's be real - moderation is not a factor here). ?Tasty, gimmick-free BBQ! Also, the cheap, pulled pork sandwiches on the after hours menu were top-notch, even from a crock pot. ?I think I had four.

I would give 3.5 stars. Fette Sau is a greasy joint with unique atmosphere. For the taste of BBQ, I wouldn't say the best I had but ?having a dry rub BBQ place in middle of Williamsburg with interesting list of beer selection is hard to beat. When you walk in, you are a bit intimidated. First of all, it is packed. second of all, it feels rugged and you are lost wondering what you are supposed to do. Third of all, it definitely feels like guys thing. However, once you sit down with your BBQ (we had sausage, ribs and hand pulled brisket and some sides), we feel better. Looking around, you see washed brick walls with meat parts drawing, huge German pub style wooden tables and unexpected flat screen playing burning fireplace. I am sure this would play sports games some other times. Now the beer choices. The bar tab handles made out of kitchen tools were interesting to look at. The drinks are local but the display of the bottles at the bar shelves are unique and worth observing. Foodwise, I found all a bit bland for my taste. Even the sauces were bland too. Even after taking so much liberty of the sauces on my meats, it screamed "more". ?Overall impression - It tasted like bread dipped in EVOO & salt and pepper. Which is good but bland. The ribs were cold eating there. I took some orders out and after microwave at home, it tasted 10 times better but the dry spices from the meat smeared in my hands didn't go away after 5 washes. Holly Molly~~ The hand pulled brisket on the bun with the sauce did work though. I enjoyed the simple right there sandwich I made myself. Sausage was a bit spicy but still bland. The staffs are friendly but a bit aloof for some reason. Near the closing time, all of staffs had bourbon(?) shots.. Hooray~~~ wish my job does that. LOL I need to come back during summer time which outside tables are open. I want hot BBQ with beer washing down my throat. Until then, it is ok+ for me.

YES, folks, it's another installment of monthly dinner group. Try to contain your excitement! True to tradition, this month we again experienced the delights of our favorite carnivorous pursuit, that of the glorious, peerless PORK. POOOooooOOOOOOoooooOOOOOOOOOOoooooRRK.K.K.K.k.k.k.?..k...k Evidence of the virtues of the porcine comestibles can be found in some noteworthy quotes from former presidents, authors and other historically significant thinkers. To wit, the following: "Ask not what your PORK can do for YOU, ask what YOU can do for your PORK!" --John Fitzgerald Kennedy "I am for those means which will give the greatest amount of PORK to the greatest number." --Abraham Lincoln "Be not afraid of PORK. Some are born eating PORK, some achieve PORKATIOUSNESS, and some have PORKATIOUSNESS thrust upon 'em." --William Shakespeare "It is a far, far better thing that I eat PORK, than I have ever done..." --Charles Dickens (from one of his lesser-known works, "A Tale of Two Pig Farms") "A PORK in the hand is worth two in the bush" --Anonymous (get yer freakin' mind out of the gutter, I'm serious) "When in Rome, do as the Romans do -- EAT PORK!" --St. Ambrose The monthly dinner adventure at Fette Sau began as many of the others do, with bourbon, neat (of course). In case you weren't aware, Fette Sau has quite a rich selection of bourbons. Basil Hayden was the choice for me upon recommendation of the bartender, given that I tend toward the Bookers, Knob Creeks and Bakers of the world. ?But I digress; let's not lose sight of the fact that this review is about... PORK, dammit. An important logistical tip: Get there before 7:30 and grab some table real estate; the place fills up and it's seat yo'self. Did we partake of EVERY SINGLE pork offering available at Fette Sau? NO. Probably most notably we didn't opt for the Pulled Pork, but if you want to pull your pork, well, instructions need not be imparted here. However, we did have the: 1. Pork ribs: ?succulent, juicy, fall-of-the-bone tasty goodness. My personal preference is to slather with barbecue sauce. ?The house version tastes like it has some mustard in it. ?It's different than most I've tried. Tasty, though, and highly recommended. 2. Brisket: Yes, I know this is not PORK ferchrissakes, but perhaps it's a way of assuaging my roots and warding off the spirit of my paternal grandmother who rolls over in her grave at every mouthful of non-kosher victuals that traverse my pedigreed lips (let's not even mention my tendency to date shicksahs. ?I comfort myself in the knowledge that there is no such thing as hell for Jews, so I have no future there, despite my transgressions). The point is BRISKET IS JEW FOOD. Thanks much; ?excellent. Moving right along: the brisket was tasty, even if it wasn't PORK. I slathered it with barbecue sauce as well. 3. PORK sausage: ?somewhere in the realm of soft salami, warm and extremely tasty. ?I only had a bite or two, because by the time I got to it my stomach was completely distended to the point of explosion. This was mostly due to my spiritual encounter with: 4. PORK BELLIES (holymotherfuckingshit): Epiphanies come in many manifestations; some see shafts of light, some hear angels singing, some feel the force of a fifteen pound sledgehammer connecting directly with their left temple. This was different; this experience was more the juicy, PORKY, squishy feeling of meat juices and liquid fat melding together on my palate. It was like bacon on steroids, minus the curing, the nitrates and all that sodium. It was freakin' fabulous; a "porcinary" epiphany, if you will. ?From my experience, if you're going to have one thing and one thing only at Fette Sau, PORK bellies are IT. ?POOOOOoooOOOOOOOoooooRRRRK.K.K.k. k.k.k... YES. Some minor songs on the hit parade: Gus's Pickles, which are an interesting compliment but felt a little out of place given their lower east side Jewish roots and this is the hipster shrine to PORK. ?YES, I SAID IT, this place is a SHRINE TO PORK. ? The potato salad is tasty if not remarkable. ?Oh, and the beans were actually quite delicious, so I'd recommend those. If you want to get your inner (or outer) hipster on and love some barbecue, head on down to Fette Sau. ?It's sure to please. Love it, need it, want it, use it, get over it.

I like this place. ?It's a fun atmosphere, they have great beers on tap and of course, there's delicious BBQ meats!! ?I got this pork cheek thing that was super delicious. ?However, I just wish it were more of a waitress service place. ?I like to take my time when I go to a BBQ place and I juts sort of felt very rushed because it was cafeteria style! ?Otherwise, I enjoyed it! :)

I've had the opportunity to visit the Texas 'feedlot' BBQ restaurants in and around Dallas and Fort Worth on multiple occasions (though critic credibility needs to be earned, not casually stated). ?Fette Sau re-creates a similar experience through the rustic open seating picnic tables and pay-per-pound smoked meats. ?The meat is brusquely slapped onto butcher's paper before being whisked away and consumed with a variety of sauces and condiments, always within reach of your grubby, greasy, meat juice covered paws. ? This is where the similarity ends. ?Replace oversized, pasty, Texans, shoving piles of meat into their gaping maws, with Fette Sau's sensitive looking Williamsburg hipsters, daintily plucking at a pork rib. ?Replace Budweiser with Fette Sau's impressive selection of craft brews and an even grander library of whiskeys and bourbons. ?Replace honest sides of baked beans, potato salad, quick pickled cucumbers, and slaw, with Fette Sau's fussy, somewhat overpriced, and uninspiring side dishes. Social observations aside, the quality of meat at Fette Sau should be the focal point. ?Their brisket is easily the best item on the menu - thickly penetrated with smoke, and tender beyond belief, the addition of a sauce or condiment would only sully the perfect beefy flavor. ?Competently smoked pork belly is redolent of its close cousin, bacon, which is always a good thing. ?However, the pulled pork was on the dry side, and the boneless beef ribs were about as exciting as chewing on cardboard. ?The eclectic and extensive menu of smoked meats are a classic mistake - the truly great pit masters, whether you're in TX, NC, or KS will focus on one or two cuts of meat, and seek perfection. ?The Dinosaurs, Hill Countries and Fette Sau's of our world seek to please the masses. ? Despite my snootiness towards Texas and its plus sized patrons, I have a genuine respect for the 'artisan' pit master that can only be found in the south. ?Fette Sau makes an attempt at this level of technique and sophistication, and misses ever so slightly. ?This fact, and the marked difference in customer BMI's, are what sets great southern BBQ and Fette Sau apart.

There once was a girl from New York With a great love of barbecued pork. Despite Jews' prohibitions She took trafe positions And did place the pork on her fork. Um, yes. ?I really like barbecue. ?So naturally I was psyched when Fette Sau opened. ?Now, as a rule, I have issues with NYC barbecue. ?Not because it's mediocre, although it is, but because of the incredible cult of preciousness surrounding it: the obsession with 'recreating' 'authenticity' and the innumerable self-conscious Southern trappings that ring as phony as the drawls in 'A Love Song for Bobby Long.' (Hey, I had HBO.) ?Go to the Bryant Park bbq fest if you want to know what I mean: hundreds of foodies, lined up for hours clutching copies of Saveur and relishing the authenticity of the experience. Down south, barbecue's just what people eat, the way we eat pizza. ?Some of it's good, some bad, but it's always unfussy. ?And you know what? ?I kind of like having something that we can't get in New York, that you have to travel for. ?You know how peeps are always prosing on about eating seasonally to actually appreciate the rhythms of what we eat? ?We're so spoiled in New York that we don't realize the same applies to the regional. Rant over. Fette Sau is okay. ?The atmo is very good - sepia-toned (my fave adj) and decorated with antique phonograph horns and other arcana. ?Bar seats are made from tractor seats (cool but v uncomfortable), tables are wood, there's a great bourbon selection and the food's cafeteria-style, served onto butcher paper. So far so good, but the pulled pork was meh - fatty, not very flavorful and utterly lacking in the unctuous melting quality of great bbq - the potato salad a bore, the beans forgettable. RUB, Dinosaur and Daisy Mae's are all better, even though this spot has em all beat for atmo. ?If your main objective was drinkin', with food an afterthought, I'd call this a superior choice. ?But even by NYC standards, you can do better for bbq.

The bar here is great. ?I like the different sizes you can get your beer in from half pints to gallons. ?I like the bourbon selection, and I like the perfect bar stools, which perfectly fit your rear. We didn't know what we were doing as we hadn't been there before. ?The cook looked positively annoyed at us for ordering, and no one really pointed us in the right direction as far as protocol. I liked the pork belly; it was fantastic. ?The baked beans I actually found too rich, and the amount of fat in them was overwhelming. ?I love fat, but this was just too much. The ribs were disappointingly dry, although I know ribs can be temperamental, and I appreciated they used a dry rub. The brisket was underwhelming. ?The potato salad was alright, but really, I wanted some real honest-to-goodness American potato salad with mayo and mustard and pickles and all the good stuff, not a vinegar dressing. ?I just don't want it. ?And when eating barbecue, who does? I'd go back and drink and eat the pork belly and try the ribs again. ?But I'd take Smoke Joint's pulled pork sandwich over everything else here any day.

Of the several times I have been to Fette Sau, I can truly say that the BEST time to go is on a Sunday afternoon between 1 and 4, for the following reasons: ?(1) hardly any line, either for the meat or at the bar, (2) always readily available seating (sat at the bar this time which was nice!), (2) plenty of time afterwards to become less bloated before bed! Anyway, what a nice day it was was Sunday 7/17 to jump on the L and make the pilgrimage to my favorite BBQ spot in NYC, albeit a little hot. ? No lines as expected and plenty of seating. We eat alot so, for 2 people, we ordered .5 lbs of Berkshire pork, belly (which is plenty given its richness), 1.5 lbs of St. Louis pork ribs (much preferred over the beef ribs), and .5 lbs of the brisket. ?The pork belly and the ribs were amazing as usual. ?No sauce of any kind necessary! ?The brisket has not been my favorite in the past as I have gotten some dry cuts but this time it delivered - very juicy and well marbled! ? The pork ribs are always my favorite though - huge, juicy, rubbed perfectly. ?Just amazing. For sides, we got the pickles, cole slaw, german pot salad, and baked beans - all small orders. ?All very good but never mind blowing. ?Baked beans with burnt ends are the highlight. ? Minor criticism - wish they had something fried and/or something macaroni based. ?No big deal, I will live. Couple pints of Captain Lawrence each to wash it down. ?Great afternoon. ? Best BBQ place in NYC and it's not even close if you like this style.

For yankee BBQ, not bad, not bad at all. If you like meat, this is your place. ?I had the pork ribs and they were tasty and my friends ordered the brisket (hey, not bad either) and some pulled pork, which was good but holds no candle to South Carolina pulled pork, but that's some high standards. They ran out of sausages which I was bummed about because they looked real good. The portions are big. Order less than you think you may want. I had leftover meat for days. But what's up w/ the lack of good sides? I'm not really a big meat person. I was a veggie for years and now I have pangs of guilt when I do eat meat, plus I can only eat so much. What I really want is yummy sides. So, how 'bout some collard greens or some roasted corn. I want some mac and cheese people and I want some okra. Geez. Sides cannot consist of potato salad (kinda boring), Broccoli salad, which they ran out of, bags of potato chips (come on, at least make them yourself) and pickles, although the pickles were yummy. However, the atmosphere makes up for the shortcomings. There are picnic tables so you may sit w/ your friends and neighbors and the bar is stocked w/ a great selection of bourbon and all the rest. Plus you can get jugs of beer. How fun! I came here for my bday and it was indeed good times. There's often crazy long lines so hit up the bar first. And for all you Willsburg people, they deliver (Sun-Thurs only)! P.S. They are open late. Yee haw!

Pros: For a Southern BBQ snob I admit that their pork butt and shoulder and belly are dynamite. ?Seating is no-frills and communal. ?Trays are easy to share off of. Cons: ?I smelled like my granddaddy's backyard trash fire when I left. ?My coat smelled like a fucking Boy Scout Jamboree. ?Get some ventilation Mr. Sau. ?Also...can I please get my food AND beverage at the same counter?? ?I really don't feel like waiting behind some douchebag who's hitting on ladies at the bar in order to get a Sprite. ?People talk about the rude service but seriously....I'll choke you out if you give me attitude after I've waited in line for 15 minutes to pay $8 a lbs for meat.

Great Brisket. This place lives up to the hype. If you're a bbq lover confined to the northeast, you should make it a point to visit this place. The brisket was tender; pieces broke away ever so softly upon my first bite. The smoky flavor lasted (within my mouth) for hours. It's not the best or moistest brisket I've savored, but their brisket stands out as stellar by any and all standards. And, anytime I'm within a 2-mile radius, this place is my first choice. I can't wait for my revisit. Furthermore, this place serves up their bbq'd meats by weight, 1/4, 1/2, 1lb, etc.. And, they have a variety of meats & sides for you to choose. Order however much, or little you want, mix and match. That's the beauty.

Holy beejesus this place is GREAT. Let me break it down for you: BBQ by the pound; beer by the gallon and housed in a old mechanics garage. Too cool, right? Went here on the first springish day in NY with a bunch of buds to celebrate the warmish weather (emphasis on "ish"). I'm pretty sure we got 4 lbs of everything and every side (I love, love, loved the pork belly, ribs and potato salad). I didn't have to wait in the queue (that's what boys are for, right?) so us girls nabbed one of the picnic/cafeteria style benches and waited for the grub. Every table comes decked out with homemade BBQ sauces - they have a variety - and rolls of paper towels! Which is perfect for me as I seem to get sauce over every square inch of me. We wound up staying so long that we sampled a ton of their beers, cider (barf) and capped it off with some whiskey. Seems to be both a really popular neighborhood joint (lots of babies!) as well as with the younger set. Not that we ran into this problem, but I did notice they seem to have more customers than tables and since you line up buffet style to get your meat, it can be a bit of a crapshoot if you get a seat after or not (so it's good to come in a group and split up like we did). Also be warned since it is an old garage, they have a huge sliding metal door that stays open the entire time so when the sun goes down, it can get just as cold inside as out.

It's impossible to get a seat*, I wouldn't call it "barbeque" specifically, at least how I came to know it growing up in North Carolina and Georgia, it's priced really high, there's no mac-n-cheese, the potato salad is the best (only?) side worth getting and even though the excitement of ordering your beer by the gallon has to have something to be said for it, the brisket alone makes this place a four-star place. Get other things, for sure -- the belly bacon is tremendous, and the pork ribs weren't bad (drier than they should be), but the brisket ... oh, man. Don't tell my mom I said it might be better than her's. * - Basically, dont' come here by yourself. Make sure you have a friend (or two or three, basically everyone who is not the one person who is ordering) who can go on a hunt like a hawk looking for people who are getting up from the minimal number of benches available inside. It's easier to come here in the summer (though many other people have that theory, too) because there's copious outdoor seating. But if you come when it's cold, and you want to sit inside, prepare to stand there awkwardly with your food until a space magically opens up.

Summer is fast approaching. Let's get an early start with some BBQ!!! Was looking forward to trying their ribs, but after seeing it just sitting behind the counter, decided to just order 2 bones to give it a try. Falls off the bone with each bite, but not mind-blowing good. A tad dry with some smoky flavor. Beef brisket seemed to be the star of the afternoon as guests ahead of us was ordering that, so can't go wrong with joining the crowd right? RIGHT! When it was our turn to order, a nice new chunk of juicy brisket was awaiting to be sliced. Savor the tenderness and fattiness of the meat in between the potato buns- no need for ketchup or hot sauce. German potato salad was a nice, cold and satisfying side dish. By the time we were done, line got pretty long. So if you dont like waiting, go before 3pm on a Saturday.

Seriously, I'm in a whole heap a trouble! I can't believe it, but this white boy from New Jersey knows his BBQ! This place is swine-alicious and its damn near 10 steps from my front door. The pork shoulder was amazing and the baked beans delicious as a little top off. No need for sauce, just use the beans. And the broccoli salad--HUGE HIT! We initially got it to make ourselves feel a little less carnivormongous, but darn it if we didn't hit the jackpot with that tasty marinated yumminess anyhow! If you want ribs, arrive before 7pm. Otherwise the pastrami (bangin!) and the various pork products that remain available will suit you mighty fine! I'll give the fifth star once I've verified the rib-to-goodness...

After I found out about Fette Sau, I wanted to go. ?Immediately. ?Who cares that it was December? ?I planned on guilt-tripping my friends into going for my birthday... ?Muahahah. ?An extremely cold front caused me to feel some pity and I decided to do a take-out fiesta at my apartment instead. ?So my wonderful Porkchop went with one of our friends to pick up some pig and cow. Even though everything cooled off a bit in transit, it was still delicious. ?Their menu supposedly changes every day, but my favorites were the pork sausages and bone-in beef ribs. ?The German potato salad (made with vinegar instead of mayo) and pickles were my favorite sides. I'd still like to get the full experience of dining here, smoke in my eyes, pig grease permeating my clothes... ?Maybe when the weather is nicer :) On a side trivia note: Porkchop and company said that the workers informed them that BBQ is actually traditionally from Germany! ?Most of the immigrant settlers in Texas were German, which apparently also "explains the cowboys" (we didn't get that last part). ?One complaint is that the workers pretty much forced a tip, even though we were getting take-out.... ?Boooo.

Oh the Bourbon selection was pretty impressive and I was able to explore decent top shelf selections and compare the different flavors from the different regions. ?The prices were reasonable for the quality of food you were getting. ?But be warned as you immediately REEK of Smoked BBQ upon setting foot into the place. ?Despite my annoyance of having my clothes smell like smoked BBQ, i'll go back any day for some more meat!

Big communal picnic tables, they give you a metal tray and pile it with meat and then you pay and then you're happy. Everything I tried was really good. As a lapsed Jew, I relish the opportunity to put this varied an array of pork inside of me, but first the sides. The saurkraut is ok, crispy/new, but strong. The baked beans were amazing, the beans were burnt, the sauce was thick, and about a 1/5 of it was made of meat. ?The broccoli salad is worth a try but not impressive. But the meat is fantastic. The pork ribs are dry rub and delicious. The pork belly had about 1/8 of an inch of fat on it, and the fat was perfect. You put the belly in your mouth and it just melted into a fattyporksauce which gently coated the tender meat as you chewed. The sausage link was good, but everything else I had was better. There are four sauces on the table, horseradish, a sweet barbecue sauce, something very vinegary, and something I can't remember. I had two beers. The first was (I think, I'll admit I wasn't completely sober by the time I got here) a stout or very dark lager, recommended by the bartender. It was pretty good. But someone else had gotten the Goose Island Bourbon Stout, which is the liquid average of bourbon, stout and molasses. I really loved it, it may be my new favorite drink, but it's syrupy and others compared it to cough syrup, so maybe a predilection for the tussin worked in my favor tonight.

Disappointing. On a number of levels, really, although I think it's a cute concept. The BBQ was dry, lukewarm, a bit overdone (all of these problems may be related obviously) and lacked smoke flavor, although the beef brisket was better than our other selections. Not so bad that it couldn't be saved by some kick-ass sauce ... but the sauce options were SERIOUSLY weak and basically amounted to (i) ketchup, (ii) mustard and (iii) vinegar. WTF? They really seem to have put no effort at all into the sauce. Did the sides save the day? No. The one that I tried, the coleslaw, was very bland. And then there's the seating, which takes the cafeteria-style concept a bit too literally, right down to the awkwardness of having to carry your tray of meat around the room for several minutes waiting for a table to open up. Would in theory be willing to tolerate this because it's not their fault that they're busy -- but when the BBQ is average at best this contributes toward making the entire experience off-putting. Maybe I came on an off-night, but they're pretty close to screwing up a concept that I didn't think could possibly be screwed up. It could be "fun" with the right group, but the same could be said of a number of restaurants in Times Square. In some ways this felt similarly theme-parky but with a hipster rather than tourist aesthetic.

Heads up before you read this review and realize I don't mention the food that extensively: I ate beforehand, so I didn't really eat here. I just had a leeeetle bit. I'd recommend another review for the full food rundown. The 4 stars is based more on the fact that from what little I experienced, I'd definitely come back to fully get down with meat by the pound(s). Fette Sau was where I met up with Brooklyn Beer Crawl Yelpers. It was their third stop of the day. I had some catching up to do in the drinking department. After some wandering, the pink neon Fette Sau sign beckons, kind of like that bar sign in Mr. Destiny (...Jim Belushi movie? Too obscure/random a reference?), and outside Craig N. and Molly C. are smokin' and cheery. Besides these two fine specimens, outside of Fette Sau ain't much to look at -- basically a lot of concrete/pavement. There are some tables out, presumably for summer dining, but it's barren 'cause it's colder than a witch's tit. Stopping to chat, I learn very quickly that Craig is intoxicated, quite full, and feeling quite generous with his leftovers, which are just begging to be taken advantage of. I hurry through the doors before he changes his mind. Inside, Fette Sau is kind of like a pub, but also industrial at the same time -- garage-like, as others have noted. I see that my fellow Yelpers have commandeered one of the long communal pic-a-nic tables. I seem to have caught the aftermath of the carnage, as it's not as rowdy as I would've thought; everybody seems to have settled into a beer/meat induced stupor. Except Oriana. She's babbling about getting more sausage. Can't get her fill of it, apparently. Jon S. chronicled some pretty good quotes that may or may not be attributable to Lady O. Anywhoo, I go to order a beer from the bar, and there's a bunch of stuff on tap I've never tried. This is always exciting. I ask for a suggestion, and the bartender makes a pretty good one. Sitting back down and stealing a rib from Craig's tray, it's pretty tasty, and comes off the bone just the way it ought to. It's been a while since I've had some good BBQ, and so Fette Sau stirs up some finger-lickin' memories. Craig and Molly come in and I try Craig's drink -- a bourbon stout. I know that I love stouts. But I sure don't know what a bourbon stout is -- I mean, I know bourbon, I know stout, but their powers combined? Color me clueless. Whatever the bastard is, it's potent (9.0% alcohol?), and that's a winner in my books. I think we can deduce that I loved this drink, but I played it cool and we passed it around. Nobody else wanted to kill it, so I got to. I was pleased. Later at the insistence of Molly C. (whom Craig was now resting his head on, a sign of things to come), I tried the baked beans -- and whaddya know, the broad's onto something; little bits of pulled pork mixed in definitely add to the flavor. Meat is always a welcome addition, and I particularly enjoy when it's a surprise, since it's only the best surprise ever. Sneaky meat. Anyways, Fette Sau fills up and is obviously pretty popular for good reason. If you have a big group, do what the Yelpers did -- get there early, eat your stuff, digest, then turn over the real estate. Likewise, you can make like me and get there late to pilfer the leftovers from near comatose patrons. Ain't no shame in scavenging. Thanks Craig!

Brisket!!! that is the creme de la creme of this BBQ place in Williamburg. It is absolutely adorable with seating outside as well as inside, picnic style tables that are adorned with different styles of sauces, vinegar and mustard to tickle your palate. The interior is warm and inviting with a cute bar area to order flights of bourbon/whiskey, lots of beers on tap and cocktails as well as wine to be offered. How you get your meat on, go up to the butcher, place your order. They have two blackboards with the list of meats, sides and even Key Lime tarts for that sweet after dinner treat. The meat is sold by the pound and the sides are either small or large. I sampled the brisket and the ribs. Also tasted the pork belly. My favorite was the brisket....so delicious and moist. YUMMY!!! The pork belly was also very tasty. The ribs were good, but a dry rub and not the best I have tasted. They also had sausages and pulled pork shoulder. As for sides, I got the German potato salad, sauerkraut and Gus's homemade pickles. It comes with dinner rolls and its self-serve, wetnaps, forks, knives....all served on your own tray...much like school cafeteria. They take credit cards, VISA and MC and have many fancy style Sodas to chose from. I missed out on Steve's Key Lime Tart....damn!!! Next time. I also tried this Red Zinfindal wine...for 8.00 a glass it was bold and smooth and went really nice with my BBQ meal. I really enjoyed this place and got my BBQ fill. I def recommending coming here and giving it a try at least once. It will be a while for me to go back, but I'd def venture to Williamburg again for some yummy Brisket.

Not even 24hrs into my 25th year of life, I came to Fette Sau, consumed about 3lbs of meat, quietly contemplated what death by pork belly (the savory pig's, not mine) would feel like (HEAVEN), drank a gallon of oh-so-smooth Sly Fox Ale, and thought to myself, "25 is going to be a sweet year." Thank you, Fette Sau.

NYC's Best BBQ is in BK! The Squab made a birdsonal request to have her birdday dinner to be hand delivered from Fette Sau. ?So, the Flying Pig obliged, and oinked on over to Williamsburg with his other pork loving friend. There, they both fell in love. ?Love at first sniff. ?All kinds of pork products were at hand. ?Even beef ribs that would've placed a Kool Aid smile on Fred Flinstone's face were sitting nicely on display. We went nuts and brought back a couple hundred dollars worth of heart attack inducing barbecue-licious meats. ?Some cuts were better than others, but I'm sure it depends on the day. ?Plus, I don't really remember what was great and what wasn't, so we'll leave it at that. ?If I didn't feel like my arteries were clogging up, then this barbecue kingdom would be a hands down 5-star establishment. All in all, forget your Daisy May's, Hill Country, RUB, Blue Smoke, Wildwood, ... ?Don't be scared, and make the trek over to BK to enjoy some German-style "fat pig" (fette sau)!

This is what I have to say: shut it, haters. Fette Sau is amazing. I took my parents here and shared half a gallon of beer with my dad and then told them all my secrets. Fette Sau did pork belly before pork belly was cool. I'm sick of reviewers pulling the: "Well! Back in Texas..." card. Guess what? I used to live in Texas and when my born and bred Texan friends came to visit they said, with glazed, pork-induced eyes, "Uh, this is really, really fucking good." The ribs are incredible. The brisket would make a Jewish grandmother thank Jahweh for life. The pork belly makes me curse my nine year stint as a vegetarian. Tell the dude dishing out the meat what you want and for how many people. He knows his shit and will give you the right amount. Fette Sau offers whiskey flights. WHISKEY FLIGHTS!!! Again, a single word for this: amazing. And as always, please tip your bartender. He knows his shit and will let you taste the beer- if you ask nicely- before you commit to a half (or whole) gallon. Wait, what was that? It's hard trying to get a seat for you and 19 of your best friends at 7:30PM on a weekend? Boo hoo hoo. Stay in Manhattan next time.

This place is pretty good, it's uncommon to find this kind of bbq in the tri-state area. They have an interesting beer selection, but their Burbon selection is the highlight of their bar. Unfortunately, this isn't the kind of place I'd want to sit and get boozed up all day, so I stick to beer. It's super casual, you eat on wooden benches and they give you a roll of paper towels. Food is served by weight, on aluminum trays covered in waxed paper. It's a fun place, and you will leave stuffed. It does get pretty crowded on saturdays though. Expect a 30+ minute wait for food. The upside, however, is that the bar is separate from the food line, so you can send a guy for a gallon of beer and some mason jars to keep you "entertained". And yes, you read that right. Gallons of beer and mason jars.

There's lots of things to like about Fette Sau & one thing to absolutely love. I like the ordering system. I hate having to order a platter--a combo platter, if I'm lucky--and restricting myself to but one or two meats, when all of them sound (and smell!) delicious. Fette Sau does away with this system, opting to have customers order their various meats by weight. I like the sides. Fresh and crunchy, perhaps a bit too salty, pickles. Likewise for the sauerkraut. Some excellent baked beans. Not a disparaging word regarding any of them. I liked most of the meats. The brisket, for instance, was unmemorable. The pulled pork and ribs were better. The sausage was pretty great, which was nice, as I often find sausage to be an afterthought at most barbecue joints. But the pork belly, well, let me tell you.... I had a love affair with the pork belly. This was, without dispute among my group of battle-hardened barbecue enthusiasts, the best pork belly any of us had ever had. It changed my life. Overall, Fette Sau is an above-average barbecue joint that absolutely demolishes the competition in one category: pork belly.

Gallons of beer, seriously with a sidecar of BBQ everything on a pig you could think of. ?When I walked in I had no idea what do, how to order...there are just prices per pound of pork rump, pork chop, etc. so you really have no idea how to order, but if you ask...the dude behind the counter just made a "kick-ass plate" (his words) for 3 and it was great, a little of everything - nice white pork chop (my fav), charcoal bacon fat, pork all parts, etc. and it all tasted great. ?My first bite was all fat, but damn was it sexy. Place is low-key, community seating inside and out, walk-up ordering and they serve GALLONS of beer. ?After you lug the jug to your table you can consume copious amounts of alcohol with good food. Stick to your ribs - yes. ?Salad lovers rejoice - not so much. ?The smell when you walk in is awesome and overall it is a place I would go back to again and again.

BBQ. An all American food group right out of the wild wild west. Fette Sau. The way people wait for tables like vultures...it's a little bit Texas roadhouse. All it's missing is the saw dust on the floor. The line out the door was a signal of good times to come and we took our place in line like a high school cafeteria. After about 15 minutes of waiting, we were ready to order. Brisket, pork shoulder, sausages, beef tongue pastrami (I was feeling adventurous) and a rack of ribs later, the other half of our group had scored us seats and a gallon of beer (yes, they serve beer by the gallon) and we took our seats on the long communal picnic bench table ready to eat ourselves into a coma. Be advised heading to this joint with 6 people is a mistake. It's tough to get a table. We got lucky. Moving on to the meat. SO GOOD. I mean juicy, tender, perfectly cooked and piled onto a over-sized tin platter in an all you can eat, all hands on deck style that I was totally digging. Slugging back beer from a mason jar really puts you in the mood to continue the gluttonous meal. There were multiple sauces on the table and all the meat came with soft rolls. I was pulling them apart, loading the pastrami onto it, a little bit of sauce and some of the homemade vinegar based cole slaw we chose as a side. Phenomenal little impromptu sandwich. Can I have another to go please? Thinking back on it, the wait was nothing I couldn't handle again. They change the types of meats they offer every night, so you always have a great excuse to head back. The only thing I didn't try was the extensive and very attractive whiskey bar. Don't worry, Fette Sau. I'll be back to conquer your alcoholic selection soon. http://hungrychildinthec

This place was the BEST yet, we arrived early so it was a slight line abt 10mins at best. We ordered Brisket, Pork Belly and RIbs. Sides were the Beans potato salad and broccoli total about 60 bucks for two people. The meats were the best I've eaten, the beans were slammin, potato salad meh, and my dinner partner had the broccoli. We ordered some sausage for take away,which I have yet to eat. I highly recommend Fette Sau and will return again.

Don't kid yourself! This was a nice attempt at quality ribs. Maybe I am being too critical, but I am from Memphis, TN the home of ribs and blues. The dry rubbed ribs here are decent, your best bet here is to go for the pulled pork or a sausage. I wanted to give this place a test drive, so my partner and I ordered everything: a slab of ribs, 1 lb. of pulled pork, 1 sausage, a small order of baked beans, and the broccoli salad. The verdict: babyback ribs (average and cold), pulled pork (average and cold), sausage (good and cold), baked beans (very good and cold). Something must have been wrong with the food warmer because all my food was cold. The quantities we ordered were just enough for two people and totaled $45 for the food and $13 for our drinks. The scoop: Very casual. After several beers the ribs will taste better. No one appreciates a place that serves food cold, layered on wax paper for $45, then expects you to go to the bar to pick up your water and beverages. On a busy night, bring a friend or two. One person can guard the table while the other two split duties: bar/food line. Then you can regroup and sit at the table together. Otherwise, good luck carrying your tray to the bar to pick up your drinks only to find all the tables full. The owners of this place should rethink their service strategy, especialy for the price. Cool space and cool vibe. The bar has a neat setup. You can purchase beer by the 1/2 pint, pint, or gallon.....yelp...a gallon. This is a great place for groups. If the food was served hot and the beverage setup was different, I would have rated it 2 1/2 stars.

First the positive: ?The decor is awesome...I LOVE the mural of meats and the place has a great industrial look and a fun vibe. ?The outside will be fun and LOUD during the summer months although the sign hovering above looks like it belongs over a bakery. The food: ?COLD! ?So so so cold. ?We went around 7:00 on a Wednesday and the food was freezing cold and mostly dry. ?It had great flavor and texture, yet SO SO cold. ?I assume that if I go at the exact perfect time I could get really great food, but during our regular dining hours it seems as if the meat had been laying around all day. ?For $20 it was hardly a bargain...I'll be going to RUB or Blue Smoke next time i get the urge though I 3 star it for it's nice vibe and great booze. BIG WARNING: ?Don't EVER EVER EVER try the dark bbq sauce on the tables. ?It tastes like hot oil. ?It tastes like you got maced in the face after touching a ugly oily ass.

Mmm Mmmm... "Fat Pig": My kind of BBQ. I like the converted garage look with rusty yard chairs out front and the fireplace on TV in the inside. A rustic and comfortable atmosphere... down to the service. My little anecdote of their service: Some guy was trying to cut ahead of me at the bar but the bartender was nice and attentive so she caught that right away. I definitely appreciated little things like that. Sharing communal seating wasn't too bad there. The line was nearly out the door--I wonder if being #1 on Yelp's Hot Picks had anything to do with that? There's only one guy cutting and weighing everyone's order. So, expect to be patient. Everything you ordered arrayed collectively on one tray and eating off the tray was a whimsical touch. Get a quarter pound of everything so you can sample it all!

MEAT! *pounds chest* Me like meat! ?*pounds fist to table* Me eat meat and lots of meat. ?MEEEAAAAT!!! Sausage. ?Lots of Ribs. Bacon. ?Rolls. A large cup of baked beans. ?The most delicious, unhealthy gathering of food that made up my meal. ?Nothing is delicately arranged on a plate made to look pretty and served to you. ?No, no. ?Moving down the cafeteria style line, this meat is thrown onto a wax paper-covered, metal tray. ?It is arranged in such a barbaric, animalistic way that I could only observe in sheer amazement of the feast I was about to put in my belly. ?Oh, and there are utensils here, but have no fear of using your hands. ? Don't dress your best when coming here. ?Leave your fancy dress at home. You know this place is different from the moment you approach the restaurant. ?I wasn't quite sure where my friends were taking me as we approached what looked like a set up for a bad thriller, leading me to meet my unfortunate barn-yard death. ?Yet when we walked in, I was instantly enthralled with its darkly lit, rustic, ?via 1920's feel. ? Its picnic table set up, practically forcing you to become friends with your neighbors, made me shy away a bit from finding a seat (until later, as my friend who is a regular, taught me to just squeeze your butt into a seat). ?But if you plan on ordering a beer, that's separate from your food, so set your tray down first before sitting. ?You won't want to move after that-partially from the crowds, and partially from you stuffin yo face so much you won't be able to move. AND THE BEER. ?I had the Oatmeal Stout on tap. ?Oh holy sweet heaven of beer. This made me want to throw away my love of wine and hit the beer bottle forever...or jelly jar, in their case. ?The beer is served in a jelly jar. ?F**k yeah. I recommend the ribs. ?I wish I had ordered more ribs. ?They were the highlight of my meal. ?The sausage had a bit of a weird spicy kick, which threw me for a bit. ?But it's MEEEAAAAT *pounds fist to chest*...so of course, I ate it.

This is a very hard review to write, in part because this place is so great because for people like me who aren't ok just ordering one plate, you can sample EVERYTHING. ?The only bad part about this 5-star approach to the menu is that not everything is 5 stars. So what is 5 stars? ?Aside from the ability to order a little of this and a little of that, the gallon size beer is 5 star, and the pork belly is probably worth about 6 stars. Moving down the list, I'd rate the sausage about 4 stars--very good. ?The baked beans were also in the four star area for me. Down at three, you'll find the brisket: ?pretty average in my opinion. Going further down the list, hovering at around 2, we have the ribs which i really didn't like too much, and the potato salad. ?And while we're on the subject of sides, i thought the options were pretty limited. Having said all that, it was a very positive experience, and really really a good price for all the food i got. ?I would go back here in a heartbeat despite the fact that i was more or less not blown away by anything (except the pork belly, which really did kick ass).

I've been here twice now, not sure how I've missed writing a review. Let's start by saying Fetta Sau may be the greatest smelling room I've ever been in in my life. First, the drink. They have a well stocked whiskey bar, offering several different tasting trays (and the bartender will even customize one for you if you want to go down a different path). The beer selection is pretty decent as well. Served in mason jars which just seems right. Also available is Coke in a glass bottle, not a rare sight these days, but a nice one for sure. Next, the line. There is one. It will range from long to insanely long. Be prepared. Bring a drink or a friend you'll need them. Seating. Family style and kind of cramped. There's seating outside and at the bar as well. I'm a fan of personal space. You shouldn't expect much of it here. Food: I love the pulled pork and belly. The hot sausage links were good but not great, a bit pricey for what they were. The pickles are delicious. The brisket has been described to me as "the best I've ever had" by more than one person. I don't like red meat, but I tried an end piece and have to admit if all cow tasted like that I'd love cow. My perfect bite: Pulled pork on the potato roll with some of the belly doused in the Carolina style sauce with a touch of the mustard based sauce and some pickle. I've also taken home some of their bacon (both belly and jowl). It may seem expensive at $10/lb but it is damn good. Worth every cent.

Nice space with that hand-crafted industrial look, a bevy of bourbons, Tuthilltown rye, No. 209 gin, Vermont White vodka, beer by the gallon, and oh yeah, pig by the pound.

You don't have to be from Texas to know good barbecue. It's all about the meat, about the care and preparation and finally the rubs. Fette Sau succeeds at all three. The pork belly is moist, fatty, good balance of salty and meat flavor. As long as you're not recovering from quadruple duple bypass, I think it's safe to indulge. By far, my favorite cut was the brisket, followed by pork belly and finally the pork ribs. (Next on my list to try are the beef ribs and pork sausages) Where I'll say I wasn't as impressed would be on the sides. German potato salad was nothing to write back home to Germany about. Lastly, the rustic decor, communal seating and dark lighting set the mood to chow down with your fellow bbq enthusiasts. The meat will always serve as great conversation with the group sitting aside. Did I mention I smelled like bbq smoke the whole way home? Get here as early as possible if you want to beat the lines and sit comfortably indoors or outdoors. After 7pm on a weekday and I'd say good luck. Hipster line out the door for sure. You'd swear there was a salvation army drive.

BBQ ?is such a passionate subject and everyone is entitled to their own favorites in this category. ?I am submitting Fette Sau as my favorite in NYC with the caveat that I still want to visit a number of other places. ? The food here is simply put: amazing. ? The BEST pulled pork I have ever had. ? The BEST beef brisket I have ever tasted. ?Moist, flavorful and tender enough to eat without teeth. ?Perfect balance of fat and meat. ? And what hasn't been said about the Pork Belly?! ?That thing is a masterpiece. ?Just be careful not to overdo it but this thing is sliced heaven. ? The whole coffee rubbed meat thing is just perfection. The sides were also amazing - baked beans and pickles. ?Bread was also nice and fresh. ? They have GREAT beers on tap. ?The line isn't so fun as others have remarked but it's worth it - just head there as early as you can. ? My one small negative is that their pork ribs, while great, aren't my favorite. ?I've had better in other states. ? Regardless, if you like meat, you will like Fette Sau.

Fette Sau, I wish I could give you 5 starts, I really do. First of all, this BBQ joint is the perfect example of ?"welcome to Bedford!" I don't consider it as a good or bad thing, its just very, Bedford-ish, you get the idea. It might be hard for first timer to find them since the pink neon sign is somewhat lack the size to be eye catching, and the entrance is about as wide as any mechanic's drive way. Even with the benches, you might think that was just someone's backyard. Thankfully, there are usually groups of people at the entrance which might help you to finally realize, Fette Sau, is right down the path. It's all about meat, meat, and meat, and... meat, and a bit of beans and cakes, drinks and meat at Fette Sau. Okay, here comes the bomb, the price. I have to say its a bit pricey just because after all, this is Brooklyn. However since the migration of hipsters from the city, poor economy, and being in the south side, i don't blame Fette Sau. Of course you can pay $4 for half lb of whatever, but it adds up pretty fast especially if you also have some beer with the meal. The food is good, not WOWOMGINSANE, but good enough compare to other bbq places at Williamsburg Greenpoint area. I don't drink so i have no idea if the beer collection is good (sorry ), but since most of the customers are happy, should be good. The only downside it always gets me is the amount of fat on some of the items. I know fat is awesome and good, but when you get half of what you ordered in fat form, its a let down for me. Decor wise, open space, not filled with eye candies but hey, its all about the food. There you have it, my 2 cents on Feete Sau, good place if you have a sudden craving for BBQ meat and don't want to take the stubborn L train, however, be prepared to pay Manhattan price.

I waited until after the second time I went here to write a review. The first time I had the beef brisket. It was so tough that I really had to work my knife to cut it into pieces. It was so bad I only ate one piece and had the rest thrown out. Anyone who knows anything about BBQ knows that a properly smoked piece of brisket should flake apart with just the back of a fork. This wasn't it!!! The second time I visited, I stayed away from the brisket which didn't look any better and tried the ribs. ?The ribs were a bit dry, but certainly edible with some of the different sauces available. The place has a wonderful selection of bourbons and beers. The facility is certainly entertaining with all of the wooden picnic tables and "family style" seating. However, the average (at best) BBQ and overly high prices make places like Hill Country BBQ in Manhattan a better value and a more attractive choice for someone who wants good BBQ (well, at least as good as you're going to find in NYC). I'm at a loss to explain how Fette Sau has received so many 5-star ratings. I'm guessing that: a) many of the reviews were written by young Brooklyn "hipsters" who've not had that much exposure to real BBQ and are more in love with the idea of the place than the food, or b) persons who've been away from areas that have good BBQ for so long that they have lowered their standards. All in all, Fette Sau is an interesting place to try out, just be prepared to pay a large amount of cash for average food.

HOLY PORK ORGASM IN MY MOUTH! There is a reason they are called the Fat Pig here. We went to have dinner here on a Saturday night, so needless to say it was packed. Took me about 30 minutes for the line to snake its way around the room before I got to the meat counter. Let me tell you the pork feast extravaganza that we partook in. 3/4lb Kurobota centerloin chop, 1/4lb Tamworth pork belly, 1/4lb Berkshire sweet sausage, 1/4lb Black Angus beef brisket, broccoli salad, potato salad, & Doc's Warwick Valley cider. Yes, the DP and I are fatties. But how could you not be with the quality and heritage of the BBQ we were eating? I thought it was great how they were using heritage breeds. These are the breeds that are full of the rich fat and flavor that is bred out of the today's piggies. Seriously, the fat on the chop and pork belly was so good, the DP actually liked it which is a feat in itself. Even when the fat had congealed from the cold (we were sitting outside in the middle of February), the fat still melted into deliciousness when it met our mouths. The menu changes depending on what they want to 'cue, but rest assured that you are in for a porky good time. They sell their beer and cider in varying sizes and serve the larger sizes in gallon sized jugs which is perfect for sharing with your friends. I will definitely be making return visits here, especially when the weather gets better and dining al fresco is the norm.

I ordered take-out beef brisket, pork belly, bacon strips and sausage. The only thing that takes away from a 5 star rating is the ordering process, and how long it took. I stood in line as directed and it was literally a 45 minute wait before I got to the counter, with only a few people in front of me. Luckily, they were visitors from Brazil and good conversationalists. Mind you, this was in the middle of the afternoon on a weekend. Was it worth the trip from Manhattan to Williamsburg? Should anyone visiting New York experience Fette Sau? Should I call in my take-out order ahead of time for expedient gratification of my cravings for scrumptious, fatty, lip-smacking meaty goodness? My answer is....Yes! Yes! Yes!

When a place has this many reviews (470+), you know that it is a popular spot. It's all been said, so this will be brief: Pros: Unique ambiance (for NYC - we are not in the south, so I am not going to compare Fette Sau to "True Southern BBQ" joints. Solid selection of meats. Its all about meat here, of course. Friendly conversation abounds (if you can grab a seat at one of the inside tables in the winter) Fantastic Beer/Bourbon selection Cons: Long lines (at peak hours) Difficult to find a seat for more than 2 people during winter months (tip: You can eat at the bar) That feeling that you are about to explode once you stand up. . .

I don't get it I travel all over the US, clearly people don't get what good barbecue is, it's about the meat, it's poor cuts, cook long and slow over smokey wood to render it to deliciousness, that not what I got here, I'd been reading the reviews for a long time I love "Cue" Carolina pulled pork, St Louis style, Texas style, Memphis style, western Kentucky barbecued lamb, Oklahoma style, Hawaiian style you name it I've tried it, Zagats said it was the best, And if it where only about smoke maybe I would agree the pork belly and the brisket had great smoke flavor, but the country style rib from whole pig Thursday was for lack of a better word, CRAP, tough, under cooked and I got an end and just generally nauseating I had to throw most of it away, the pork belly had great smoke the meat was tender, the brisket had great smoke flavor but was so dry and over cooked, and restaurant owners let me tell you half of the problem with the brisket was the poor butchering skills of the otherwise very nice service staff, man she cut the brisket with the grain, I had to stop her, she apologized and took it off the scale but you know some poor schlub wanna be hipsters gonna get those piece and because he wants to be hip and paid an arm and a leg for this less then great overpriced meat, he gonna tweet his friends about how great it is, even though it was only ok, I've yet to find really incredible barbecue in NYC, on the whole unless your going for the hipness factor skip this place, and I'll keep looking, so far the best barbecue in NYC is Memphis in May at Madison Square Park, as far as wheelchair access, no wheelchair accessible picnic tables, the restaurant is, the bathrooms are not,

Ah! ?Another BBQ place that serves meat by the pound. ?As we were ordering, I mentioned to my bf, "Oh, it's sorta like Hill Country..." which the server overheard. ?He hadn't heard of it, so we told him about the similar set-up but that it was much, much more chaotic. ?He said it was a pretty slow night that night (Sunday), but that it usually gets pretty crowded there too. ?He also added with a smile, "Our food's probably better though." Now, I wouldn't necessarily say that it was better, but it was still pretty good. ?Funny thing is, I think it was actually more expensive than Hill Country ($22 for a full rack of rather short pork ribs??). ?We were pretty dismayed that they didn't have any corn bread or mac & cheese on the menu. ?Can you really be a BBQ joint if you don't serve either of those things? ?We went with the broccoli salad and potato salad as sides. I liked the pork ribs - they were nice and smokey. ?I tried some of the pork shoulder and that was good, too. ?I wasn't at all crazy about the broccoli or potato salads. ?They're both vinegar-based and it was just too overwhelming. ?I couldn't taste anything but the vinegar. ?Overall, the food didn't really blow me away. The set-up and decor is pretty cool. ?I like the fact that it's kinda like eating at someone's converted garage. ?The picnic tables add to that effect, and I was digging the lighting fixtures over the bar (antique gramophone speakers, perhaps?). ?I agree with others that your clothes (and hair) will reek of smoke afterwards! ?It was a bit off-putting. The last thing I'll mention is that I had a severe case of heartburn the next day. ?I woke up with a tightness in my chest that didn't go away until I went to sleep that night. ?It was the most bizarre thing, but I couldn't really attribute it to anything other than that meal. ?Unless I was having a 24-hour heart murmur that didn't kill me. ?If it had, that would have been really unfortunate b/c I wouldn't have wanted Fette Sau to be my last meal on earth.

just the highlights.. since there are a ton of reviews: - come on an off night if you want to avoid the long wait and fight for seating. our monday was perfect. ?busy, but not slammed like usual. - burnt ends and baked beans. ?pure love. ?never had anything like this before. ?effing amazing. - i love the 1/2 pint beer option. ?i love trying new beers but i get too full. ?sick whiskey selection.. i wasn't in a whiskey mood that night, but i'd the menu was so tempting. - i tried a selection of the meats: spicy sausage, brisket, pulled pork, pork ribs, and pork belly. ?the winner is the brisket. ?i rarely get brisket, but fette sau's was so tender and delicious, it beat my usual love of pork. ?pulled pork was flavorful but a tad dry, the pork belly was good, but i've had better (prepared differently), and the sausage and ribs were good. ?even if i had to do it all over again, i'd order the same things. - 1/2 lb of meat per person was good for us (we also were not starving at the time, so adjust appropriately). - next time i will order whiskey and the broccoli.. i needed some foliage to break up the meat fest.

This is not hog heaven but for humans who love 50+ bourbons/whiskey's, great pulled pork and ribs, a genial atmosphere, wax paper covered aluminum trays, simple, and old delta blues (or covers of) then it all fits together seamlessly whether or not you jive with the cumultative effect (note: service is too slow and frankly should be more knowledgeable behind the bar so bring your patient face or don't go). ? god that was a long run on...

This is easily my favorite restaurant in Billyburg. Every time I come in, I at the very least consider swinging by for a snack. The +'s are the pork belly, pulled pork, brisket, and Blue Point Toasted Lager on tap BY THE GALLON, and an extensive whiskey list. I also dig all the butcher diagrams on the wall detailing the cuts of meat. The -'s are having to wait in line, getting your food then needing to wait in another line for brew, then having to be lucky to get a place to sit and enjoy your meal. Ever heard of a waiter? Come on Fette Sau, thousands of unemployed hipsters surround you just waiting for someone to give them a purpose in life. That purpose could be taking my order and bringing me my pork and beer!

When I first heard of Fette Sau I honestly could not visualize where this place could be, and I live down the street! But alas, upon exploration I discovered the neatly set back BBQ joint. There really isn't much for authentic BBQ in wburg so it is certainly a nice addition to the neighborhood. Definitely very cool decor and warm vibe. I can only imagine how packed this place will get in the summer time for drinks cause they've got a fun space for it. I opted for the pork ribs, if you can't do ribs right you can't do anything right. While the ribs were very much close to room temperature I did enjoy the flavor and texture. Take a pass on the baked beans, unless if you love sugar. Expect to pay a load of cash for a meager sampling of food. There is also a great beer selection. I recommend not wearing your favorite jacket to Fette Sau. Not because you'll get it messy, but because you will smell like a smoke house for a few days. Seriously, it does not come out for awhile.

Place is pretty good.. One thing I found was the meat was a little dried out.. Dried out and not at the correct temp. Then, i looked at the process behind the preparation.. It's smoked well and everything but, meat goes from the smoker into the walk in fridge? ?Meat that has been previously smoked and plastic wrapped is ?taken out and heated up at 300 degrees.. So, you spend 18 hours cooking the meat at 120 or 130 degrees but, right before you serve it, you crank it up to 300 degrees? ? They provided NC Vinegar Sauce for the pulled pork.. They have a K.C Masterpiece style BBQ sauce, they have this super Cumin sauce where all I can taste is cumin.. Felt like it was going for a Arthur Bryant type of sauce.. Not a good version.. Maybe they chose this sauce for brisket. They have a hot sauce that seems to be a mash of peppers.. ?I liked the K.C Masterpiece sauce the best.. I only tried the German Potato Salad.. Which was not German Potato salad but, a pickely version.. Lots of dill and mint.. A potato salad yes but, a German one, no.. Staff was nice and this place must rock in the summer.. Good selection of whiskey.. A young hip Brooklyn BBQ place.. They sell beer by the gallon and food by the pound.. It's all pretty good.

My recommendation is to eat before you come. By the time you get your food, you MIGHT actually be hungry for it. We waited in line for two hours ... and sorry, no food is worth waiting that amount of time for in my opinion. Also, after a two hour wait, I expected the food to be as phenomenal as everyone said. The parts of my beef brisket that were not pure fat, were delicious. But that was half of my brisket. The cole slaw was also surprisingly good, as I'm not usually a fan of coleslaw. The decor was neat... you get to noticing every inch of it from standing there so long, you at least come to appreciate that.

If it weren't for that new Cooking Channel, I may not have ever heard of Fette Sau. ?Luckily for me, I did see a show that profiled the restaurant, and my friend happened to see the same show and mentioned going there since she lived kind of close. I don't really hang out too often in Williamsburg-- so I didn't know where I was going. ?Good thing I had that Yelp app on my phone to tell me how to get there. ?Yeah, i just plugged the Yelp app... and what? ?But I may not have needed it because while walking down Metropolitan Avenue, I took a few sniffs of the air (a la Wolverine from X-men) and I just followed the scent. ? Anyway, we met up around 5:30 because it opens at 5 and (1) we wanted to beat the crowd; (2) we had somewhere to be later that night so it worked out. ?I'm glad we got there as early as we did. ?Not only do we get some of the freshest cuts of the day, it's all communal seating--first come, first serve-- so it can be tough to get a seat. ? But it also helps to know what to expect once you get there. The first thing you should do when you walk in is check out the menu and see what delicious cut of meat they have because they only feature six types per day. Once you've made your decision, the butcher will ask you what you'd like and he'll lay down this metal tray on a scale, almost precisely pile on what you wanted and that tray becomes your plate. ?Knowing this will at least shave off a few precious minutes and the people behind you on line may appreciate it. Well, now on to the juicy stuff-- the food! ?O. M. G. ?The barbecue is some of the best I've ever had. ?I love the dry rub on the meat--not only does it add a ton of flavor, but it also adds a really nice crisp, unlike some of the wet rubs. ?The brisket was so tender, the pulled pork was good, but my favorite was the pork belly. ?It was like heaven in my mouth. ?We also got the potato salad, which was more vinegar-based-- i prefer the mayonnaise-based salad-- but it was still pretty good. Next time I plan on making my way down to Fette Sau, I'm going to call in advance to see what they have on the menu. ?I was really looking forward to trying the cheeks, but I was disappointed that they weren't serving those on the day i went. ?I also want to try to the beer next time-- those glasses looked pretty cool and the taps using kitchen utensils was unique. ?I can't wait for next time now.

Time to see what kind of BBQ Brooklyn has to offer up... ?after a few disappointments in Manhattan, my Yelper in Crime and I decided to check out Fette Sau. ?The "Fat Pig" (what Fette Sau translates to in German) used to be a car repair garage... you can still imagine this place with some beat-up old cars and grease stained mechanics. ?But walk in... and you're greeted with the scent of smoked meats, a faux fireplace on a flat screen, and pit-masters handling big cuts of flank steak and ribs. ? This is not a sit-down & order restaurant. ?Instead, you stand in line, try to make out what's on the menu (can they write the letters any smaller on that board!?), place your order by the pound, receive your order on butcher paper, and pay (cash only). ?The challenge is finding seats on one of the several communal picnic tables. ?Unless I'm outdoors (there are a few outside... but obviously not idea for winter weather), I'm not a big fan of picnic tables... esp when you're sharing the table with a b-day party that got increasingly loud throughout the meal, while my YIC and I are squeezed on the very edge of the bench. ?On top of that, the party was hogging up the table and all the utensils in the restaurant (which left us to use plastic sporks). Despite the less than ideal seating arrangement, the BBQ was very good, esp the pork baby back ribs (all pork is Berkshire -- yum!). ?We got a full rack and had no problems finishing this first. ?Good rub & flavor on juicy tender meat. ?The Berkshire pulled pork was good but a bit on the dry side... which would've been fine if any of the 3 available sauces were good (only 1 out of 3 was decent). ?After tasting the brisket here, I decided for good that I'm not a brisket fan (I've tried brisket at almost all BBQ joints I've been to and yet to have liked it anywhere). ?The baked beans w/ burnt bits was also good.. but it's heavy. ?Broccoli salad was good... esp as a complement to the meat and beans. They have a good selection of local beers / ales and bourbon. ?I don't know shit about bourbon so I just got a pint of beer. ?Overall, thanks to a new environment and the company (incl all of his deep philosophical thoughts), I thought Fette Sau was a solid place. ?I'll wait to go back though... when the weather warms up and I'll be more in the picnic mood.

Before we get to the meat (and oh yes, there was meat. ?Lots of it.), let us discuss the bar. ?This is an important first talking point, because you should expect to get to know this place quite well, as members of your party will be traveling to it to re-up on booze as you wait on line. ?And yes, there is almost always quite a long line - but it's easily tempered by hooking yourself up with a GALLON of beer. ?Yes. ?Gallon. ?Beer. ? They have a great selection of local breweries, gushing out of taps with knives on them. ?Knife taps? ?Oh yes. ?Lets not forget. ?They may sell beer by the gallon, but this is a meat lover's heaven. ? So after you wait on line, go through two or three gallons of beer (it's remarkable really), dispatch friends to fight for a seat, and order up a heaping portion of meat by the pound, you're in business. ?The pulled pork and the brisket is outstanding. ?The sausage that they had that day was disappointing, but the old standbys were in top form. ?The sides compliment the meal perfectly, and the beer never stops flowing. The inconvenience of finding a place to sit, and waiting on that line is part of the fun. ?The other part is the food.

This place is really fun. ?More potluck than restaurant, it's got the friendly vibe of a family picnic. ?Meat murals, plasma-screen fireplace, paper towel rolls for napkins, sheet pans for food, canning jars for beers (the half-pints, that is), and downright tasty meat. ?The beer & bourbon menus are diverse, too. Went with a group (good suggestion), and got there early (better suggestion). ?We were lucky and got hot food, plus all the meatsies we wanted to eatsies: beef & pork ribs, veal sausage, brisket and pulled pork shoulder (my absolute FAVORITE). Minus half-star each for mostly forgettable sides (though the baked beans had a great chipotle flavor), and their bbq sauce, which by all accounts from my brave companions, was yuck.

This place is overhyped for the following reasons: -Pork belly - yes, I realize that pork belly is supposed to be fatty, but this was literally 95% fat, which isn't what I usually get when I order pork belly at other restaurants. -Brisket - tasty, but also a bit too fatty -Potato salad - this was probably the worst thing. Although it looked really tasty, it tasted like it was artificially smoked or something, and I tasted this weird taste as soon as I put a piece of the potato salad in my mouth. After several bites of trying to like it, I had to give up. -Cole slaw - it had bell peppers in it and tasted like their version of a Chinese chicken salad without the chicken. The only really good thing about the place was the boneless beef ribs, which were relatively lean and tasty. The sauces that are at the tables are also really good - you must try them when you come here. Seats are lacking, so make sure one person orders while at least one other person waits to get a table since you order at the counter, and it's first come, first serve for seats.

The food at Fette Sau is excellent. Everything you've read is true, since it's on the Internet. I love the brisket. The pulled pork is nice and lean and baked beans kind of maybe blew my mind. You cannot imagine how difficult it was to not eat my meal like a little piggy such as the younger brother in A Christmas Story. Unfortunately, there is a list of ingredients and recipe needed to enjoy yourself. Here you go. recipe for a Good Time? In one small or large group, combine (minimum): 1 Runner 1 Seeker/Squatter 1 hour of patience (per person) 1 pinch of chillin' 1 jug of beer (as desired) Upon entering the gates, immediately set at least one runner in line to get your food. Depending on the time of day, the line may be 10 minutes, or may be closer to 45. Patience should start to be employed here. The remainder of your group should seek out a table and upon finding one, squat it. In order to justify squatting seats at a table, I suggest employing another runner for a jug of beer. After your beer and table have been acquired, chill out for a bit, have a little patience for your food to arrive, and then just have a Good Time.

Seriously good BBQ and possibly the best baked beans I've ever had. I like their style too. The stools are old tractor seats. When you're ordering you tell them what kind of meat you want and they weight it up and charge you the by the pound. My cousin and I ate two pounds of meat between us and we had absolutely no regrets afterwards. The pork ribs were fantastic, the brisket was really good and so was the pulled pork. The hipster staff even reminded me of home (did I just admit to missing hipsters?). They have a large selection of microbrews that I'm pretty sure are from the South. They also have a large whiskey selection although I didn't have any. Apparently the owner of this place spent some time in Germany and that's why the potato salad has vinegar in it and why they offer sour kraut instead of cole slaw. I can appreciate a twist on an old standard -- as long as the meat tastes good. I really enjoyed my meal here and the overall atmosphere. If Fette Sau was in my hometown I'd go all the time.

The place was hard to find at first but parking during a weekday evening was easy. First impression walking in was wow... this is definitely a dive. Everything about it's decor screams Williamsburg! I love the picnic bench style seating. It forces you to be cordial and communicate with your nearby carnivore. If you have dreams of death by meat, this is the perfect place. Ordering meat by the pound for noobs can be a little intimidating and i guarantee you will order more than you can handle the first time around. I tried a little bit of everything and my fav hands down was the pulled pork... the potato bread rocks and so do the baked beans. The whole idea of ordering beer by the gallon makes me giggle like a two year old. Big plus! I left defeated and was forced to literally wrap it up, and throw my left overs in a doggy bag. Fette Sau, I'll be back... baby!

Waited for seats, waited for food, but it was well worth it I went here w/ friends on a Wednesday. Since they don't take reservations, I thought Wednesday should be a relatively quiet day. Boy, was I wrong. I got here at 7:45 PM, after nearly turning into a Popsicle after walking a 5+ min walk from the Bedford Ave L train station. This place is a converted garage, as mentioned by many people. They have park like wooden benches as soon as you walk into this garage. There's about 10-15 of them place parallel to each other until you get to the garage door. Each bench can sit 8 people comfortably, ?but since they don't' have heat lamps, there wasn't anyone outside when I was there. Once I walked into the garage, I see a huge fake fireplace to my immediate left ?with a huge plasma TV that showing a picture of a fire in a fireplace. Kinda trendy cool. There's probably 1/2 the amount of benches in here than outside, and that's where the problem begins. Since there's no wait service, you have to vulture over ppl that are sitting down, hoping they would be leaving soon. We are a group of 6, and we kind of divide into 2 groups of vultures hanging over 2 tables, sorta hedging our bets to get the 6 seats that we need. It took us close to 1/2 hour, as no one felt like leaving, which made us pretty hungry by then. Once we got our seats, we then saw how the once empty line for the food stretched out all the way to the entrance. I wouldn't quite say its a sea of humanity, more like a line waiting to get in a club or the unemployment line (gasp! sorry, but that's current economic conditions). We decide to cut in, like 2 other ppl in front of us did. Its not really a cut, as we were really here before all these ppl, just that we didn't feel like getting our food and then end up having to stand and eat. This is where the other problem is. They only have 1 counter for all meats, so service ?is expectedly slow. Even with only 2 ppl in front of us, we ended up waiting a good 20 minutes before it was our turn to get the food. At that point, I was contemplating how low a Yelp rating this can go... But as soon as I had my first bite of the food, my frown turn into a smile and all is well. Here's what we had: Pork shoulders - delicious, tender and very flavorful Ribs - fall off the bone, Wow Pork Belly - Eat bite is tender, juicy, and almost all fat, which makes it so good Brisket - so soft and delicious Sausages - a bit spicy, but a lot of delicious flavors bun - crap, stuff you can get at supermarkets, except you wouldn't want to, its really crappy that you will be like, "I don't want to put that yummy _____(name your meat) on this crap" Drinks - toasted lager - a nice flavor to it, not too light and not too heavy, I downed more than a few pints Total $94 for food $36 for beer ( a gallon) Even though the wait sucks, the food is well worth the wait to come back. But I would do it in the summer or at least not in the brutal cold of winter

It's definitely an experience. Meat-lovers can happily convene here, but it ain't the best I've ever had. Meat tastes a bit overcooked, that charcoal-y flavor is not welcome on my palate. The baked beans were glucky and overly sweet tasting. My pork sausage was also REALLY sweet. I have to give them probs for the barbecue sauce- it was spicy and tangy without overtaking the meat. Rolls were good. Liked the room- long picnic tables, french music playing, and the "WC" on the restrooms actually reminded me of Paris, not Germany. The fakey TV fire is kind of cool and simultaneously tacky. Service was kind of unfriendly- a sweaty 20something in a backwards baseball cap looked really impatient the entire time we were deciding what to order. Which was all of 2 minutes. Cashier shared the same disinterested disposition as our meat man. Worth a shot, but if you like your meat a little rarer and your service a bit friendlier, this ain't your joint.

Sounding like a villain named by George Lucas, this Billyburg BBQ joint that does as good a job as I've seen in NYC of authentically creating the southern BBQ shack feel. Once inside, you line up to make your meat order. ?The meat options are plenty, the sides are more limited (potatoes only served as chips or potato salad, no mac & cheese, no sweet potatoes). ? Meat is priced by weight aside from the sausage and the ribs. ?My Yelper-in-crime and I took advantage of the options and ordered the pulled (Berkshire) pork, a rack of pork ribs, some brisket, baked beans, and broccoli salad (her choice). ?Total price tag per person around $25. The star - by far- were the pork ribs. ?Great rub that resembled a pastrami rub more than traditional BBQ. ?Fell right off the bone. ?No sauce necessary. ?This last point is important since their trio of BBQ sauces are awful. ?A sickly sweet vinegar-based sauce and two darker sauces that both missed the mark. A good vinegar-based BBQ sauce really could've helped the dry pulled pork. ?This is even sadder when considering this is Berkshire pork. ?The quality of this pulled pork is SO far from that of Momofuku Ssam. ?Every forkful tasted a bit saltier from my tears - oh the unrecognized potential. ?Honestly, I'd order Brother Jimmy's pulled pork before this b/c at least they have a good sauce to complement it. The brisket was thicker and fattier than I like. ?Also could've used BBQ sauce. ?The baked beans weren't good - the sauce tasted burnt. ?Broccoli salad was cold - as was my reaction to it. On a more positive note, the beer selection is very good and a Mason Jar pint only runs $5. ?Great bourbon selection too. While the shack motif and picnic table seating hints at a raucous vibe, it's actually very chill. ?Don't recall any music. ?The service was friendly but a bit subdued. ?Allowed for a more philosophical conversation than I'd imagine at, say, a Hill Country or Brother Jimmy's. The ambiance, pork ribs, beer, and bourbon are 5-star worthy. ?But the rest is so disappointing that I've got to drop this place down to 3 stars. ?If you're a big BBQ fan, I would recommend bringing your own sauce to boost it up a star.

My favorite thing about Fette Sau is going up to the counter and telling them how many people you are and just asking them to make a platter for that many, and then a giant pile of food appears and you eat it. Also, beer by the gallon.

Vegetarians beware, this place stinks to high heaven, even as you're walking *up* to the entrance. ?Seriously. ? They had a tremendous beer selection, as well as a whole wall of those wonderful brown liquors. ?But despite all this goodness, the overpowering experience is the stink. ?Sorry but it is bad news. Anyway, I did end up ordering some beer. ?The menu includes beer in 1/2 pint, 1 pint, 1 quart, 1/2 gallon and 1 gallon for $3, $6, $9, $23 and $32 respectively. ?Kinda cool way to order beer if you ask me. ?I ordered a 1/2 pint of BK IPA and 1/2 pint of sixpoint signal. ?Both very good. ? We sat at the bar on these nifty old seats, they looked like out of an amusement park ride or something, contoured to your ass, rusted metal frame. ?

You see the neon sign, walk past the outdoor picnic tables, open the door, and are immediately transplanted into the heart of Texas at the best damn hoedown in town. Minus the hay and cowboy boots, you are in a barn waiting on line for your grub and gallon of beer. It's that flat screen TV that reminds you that you have not actually left NY. While waiting on line for eats, I realized that men would no longer need viagra if we were somehow able to bottle up that sweet Fette sau BBQ scent. A little spritz spritz on the neck would be all it takes to get a man back in action. And the grub- it's been said before that the meat is very good. The potato salad is delicious. So much pork in the baked beans that it is more like a chili!

Fette sau, at first I thought you were a wonderful Spuyten-Duyvil-induced dream. That my beer pickled brain had dreamed up those half sours. For indeed, how is it possible that somewhere in Williamsburg exists a cheerily lit garage at the end of an alleyway where a man will place a trough of pulled pork and potato rolls in front of you causing you to wonder, who is really the fatted pig in this equation? But no, last night with sober eyes I did confirm your existence. Luckily you were able to offer me a growler which put a quick stop to that problem. Oh and the baked beans, never in my life have I loved baked beans the way I loved baked beans last night. (Proving once again that pork bits make everything better.) There are 3 types of BBQ sauce and wet naps which read "god bless America" on their flag-decorated exteriors and when we were finally satiated and trying to remove the shiny stains from our pores I couldn't help but declare "I never do love America quite as much as when I'm wiping pig fat from my hands" It's true.

I stumbled upon Fette Sav after leaving an art show in Williamsburg one sunny Friday afternoon. ?I took off work that day and was really looking for some outdoor action. ?My boyfriend and I spotted this little place with a neon sign and picnic tables and decided to take a look. ?We went in to find an auto body shop converted into a barbecue joint. Hurray!!! ?Score!!! I really liked the design, with high ceilings and butchers diagrams of pork and lamb painted all over the walls. ?The lighting above the bar was made from upside down phonograph horns, which was very cool. ? About the food... ?I am no barbecue expert, but I do know Berkshire pork (thanks Momofuku). ?And they use Berkshire pork at Fete Sau. ?Score!!! ?I had the ribs and the brisket, both were very good. ?They serve the meat dry and offer two varieties of barbecue sauce separately: sweet tomato based and spicy vinegar. ?Finally, the bar had a good selection of beers that you could get by the pint or gallon and a SICK Bourbon selection. Overall, the place had a great laid back vibe. ?I will be returning on another sunny day!

I've got pride, and I've got a little bit of an ego. Because of those two things, I get inordinately cranky when I feel like a) someone is trying to dupe me or b) I am successfully duped. This is how I feel about Fette Sau - or as I call it, "Home of the Well-Fed Hipster." Every time I've gone there, I've asked for maybe 1/4 pound of meat, a sausage link, one side and a beer. This never fails to cost me more than $20. The fact that I find the food seriously mediocre pisses me off even more. (The fact that I've gone to Fette Sau three times despite being disappointed each and every time qualifies me as a complete sucker.) The meat is never, EVER as good as it should be. I've had the pork butt, brisket, ribs, and two kinds of sausage - the only one I'd ever opt for again is one of the kinds of sausage. The meat is generally bland, in my opinion - sometimes even a little dry. The sides are "eh," and overpriced. I liked the baked beans - the cole slaw is blech. The rolls are pathetic, and the house red wine taste like vinegar swirled around in a public toilet bowl. The fact that I'm one of very few people to rag on this place gives me pause, but what are you gonna do? All I know is that I really, really don't like this place. Sorry, Fette Sau. I wanted to love you.

i was watching Man vs Food on the travel channel and there was this pit master that had a barn as his kitchen. ?On each plate he served pulled pork, brisket, turkey legs, ribs, sausages, and a whole 4 lb chicken on a lunch tray. ?i thought to myself "now that's just stupid and unnecessary, they should take a lesson from fette sau" the concept is similar but fette sau does it in a more personalized and "un-wasteful" way. ?you pick and choose your meats, to yalls stomachs' capabilities. ? definitely a spot you want to come with a bunch of friends bc you want to taste everything, but also a bad spot to come with a bunch of friends, seating is very limited. ?oh the dilemma. check out the bar while youre there and admire all the knives. ?also get a lesson on the different cuts of meat from the wall. ? my fav - liked it all.. but i wish the potatoes were warm.

For amazing BBQ you have to give Fette Sau a try. Located in Brooklyn I decided to hop the L train and give this highly rated place a try. The restaurant somewhat resembles a garage and offers each patron communal seating. They offer a nice selection of beers as well. I ordered a scoop of pulled pork, a sausage link and some pork belly. All of which were absolutely amazed and lived up to my expectations. This place is the real deal and kicked my craving for good and classic pig bbq. I will be back to give Fette Sau another try, I mean who can't get sick of fresh pieces of PIG?

OK Fette Sau. You come highly recommended by New York Magazine: Critic's Pick. ?Nice! One of a handful of Brooklyn restaurants mentioned in the recent "Where To Eat" edition. Aces! Thought I'd give you a try. ?I do love BBQ. ?Your name coos to me, "Come. Eat fat pig, you Fat Pig." Sold. ? Is it authentic? ?Sure. ?I love ordering BBQ meats by weight. ?Makes me think I am getting exactly what I want. To the 1/4 lb! ?I love sitting cafeteria style, next to random people having random conversations. ?And the decor is? ?Well... authentic. ?It's an authentic old auto parts store. ? How's the food? ?Yeah. ?I guess that's prevalent. ?The meat is spectacular. ?Really. ?Perfectly marbled cuts of brisket. ?Not dry, not too fatty. ?Delectable pulled pork. ?The ribs are formidable. ?The sauces range from inedible to pedestrian. ?I went for the pedestrian. ?Sweet and tangy. Good, but not wheel changing. ?The sides lack passion. ?The collared greens were flavorless. ?The baked beans were WAY to sweet. ?Could barely eat them (and I'm a Fat Pig, see above.) However, the Manhattan Special Sarsaparilla (it's a pretty good one. No Sioux City Sarsaparilla, but good) was delicious. ?Excellent selection of craft beer on tap. Served at a very attractive bar, replete with stools fashioned out of old John Deere tractor seats. Authentic! All in all Fette Sau, you were attractive, you had attitude, very tasty meats, delicious sarsaparillas, substandard sauces and below substandard sides. ?You get 3 stars. As a caveat, if I could give 3.5 stars, you'd get that.

So this place is rated the best BBQ in New York. ?And while it was decent, I have had much much better in other States - even Los Angeles (Dr. Hoggly Woggly's Texas Tyler BBQ). ?So NYC continues to not really make a great stand in the BBQ department. The place is a hipster dive that looks like it was carved out of Fred Sanford's junkyard. ?Large communal tables, so you cannot bring children comfortably. ?No air system so I can't imagine eating inside during the Summer here. The sauce was nothing memorable - neither good nor bad. ?The service (you order at the meat counter and take your meal to any space you can find - was as nice as you could expect from a lunchroom kind of aesthetic. ? But let's get to the meats. ?My favorites were the boneless beef rib and the pulled pork. ?The buns are also quite tasty, as is the burnt ends Baked Beans and the half-sour pickles (more like 1/4 sour - but i preferred this). ?The Brisket was way too greasy and tough. ?The pork belly was okay - I'm not really into fat; first time I had pork belly. ?But it was all right. ? Unfortunately it did not feel as good coming out as going in. ?My stomach hurt within 30 minutes and hurt all night. ?My kid jumped on my wife's stomach on our bed and she erupted with such a loud fart, I thought she had crapped her pants. ?So there's some quality issue going on. ?Sitting too long? ?Cleanliness. ?I don't know. ?But when you get sick, you get sick. ?And I got sick. I guess you have to take what you can get in NYC with BBQ; but I would not come back. And what kind of self-respecting BBQ place doesn't have pork ribs? ?I even called and was told they had pork ribs, but upon showing up heard no pork ribs. ?Peking Duck breast (huh?) but no pork ribs. ?Booooo to youuuuuu!

Solid 4 star place. Hubby and I went on a double date with one of my bffs and her beau on a Saturday night. Had to wait 1.5 hours in line before we could order our food! Luckily, the good weather and great company made the "amusement park line" bearable, and we had worked up awesome appetites before sitting down (sharing a picnic table with a group of 5 girls) to the scrumptious dinner. We had the much raved-about pork belly, but this was my least favorite item on our communal tray. The fat to meat ratio was 2:1, and it was hard to eat more than a bite or two. Much better was the pulled pork (charred on the outside, fatty and tender inside) and the beef brisket. We also had the meatloaf ( very meaty meatloaf). I enjoyed eating the meat plain or perfectly sandwiched in my martin's potato rolls (genius!) with bbq sauce liberally applied. Our sides were the broccoli salad (meh. but i guess we needed to get some veggies in there), and a hearty portion of the baked beans (yummmm). I'd definitely return, but I'd try to go earlier to avoid the wait. When I called earlier that day to inquire, the girl on the phone told me we'd be fine if we got there before 8. We got there eat 6:45pm and still had an hour and a half wait! Be warned!

Ordering meats for here & by-the-pound at the same time rocks. ?The brisket, pulled pork, and sausages were hearty and comforting. ?The bar has kitchen implements for taps (including a meat tenderizer). ?The bourbon selection is admirable. ?

Being originally from NC and still living in NC, I take my BBQ and pork very seriously. ?Until Sunday afternoon, I couldn't fathom anywhere else in the world pulling off proper pig. ?It truly pains me to say this, but Fette Sau is the BEST pulled pork BBQ I have ever consumed. ?Hands down. ?Who knew a little joint in Brooklyn could put out such amazing que. ?Apparently, it is possible. The space is awesome. ?Converted garage with picnic tables, a bar, and walk-up ordering counter. ?Exceptional local slanted draft list served in mason jars, lots of meat choices (sold by weight), and a long list of innovative sides. ?All this served on a tray perfect for sharing with the group. We tried: - Pulled pork = Like I said above, best ever. ?I don't take this lightly. ?Bark (burnt outer meat) blended throughout. ?The stuff dreams are made of. - Pork belly = Again, phenomenal. ?Bark fabulous here as well. - Spicy Pork Sausage = Perfectly spicy with a great snap to the casing. - House-made pickles = Sour, sweet, crunchy. ?Closer to a cucumber than a traditional jarred pickle. ?Tasty! - Burnt end baked beans = OMG. ?Insanely good. ?I think the burnt end pieces mixed in push it over the top. - Rolls = The only thing I didn't think was spot on. ?Kinda bland and really could use a good toast. - Table sauces = Really well done. ?The spicy dark sauce and horseradish mustard stole the show. ?The vinegar and sweet sauce were solid though. I will dream of this meal for a very long time. ?I will return Mr. Sau!

Finally! After months of teasing, the Spuyten Duyvil crew has finally opened their Beer & BBQ joint. ?Look for the neon sign across the street from spuyten, and walk past the picnic tables. Food selections smelled amazing (food review will have to be postponed - I didn't eat); beer is a slightly more mainstream version of what we've come to know and love about Spuyten. ?Highlights included three selections from the now defunct Heavyweight brewing company.

Splurge. Indulgence. A cardiovascular exercise. Who knows what this place is going for? I did find myself on a weeknight, no less, at this establishment. Early dinner is unusual for hipsters, so beating the crowd was a plus. Because by the time 8 pm rolled around, the communal tables were filled, even outdoor seating. I especially liked the brisket (very rich, melt-in-your-mouth fare). The potato salad functioned as my side, and it cut through all the richness of the meat. Sampled the bone-in pork ribs and pork belly (of course). I expected more from the pork belly, but probably because I had the beef first. The BBQ sauce on the tables is very good. By the time I got home (I live in Westchester), I was still smelling like I had been to a BBQ all day. Smelled really good.

When you first walk in, the patio looks cool. Really cool in fact. But it also looks like it could just be one of those hipper than thou Brooklyn joints with overhyped food. Well, when you walk in the building and you smell the smoke, you know it's going to be good. I had the beef brisket, but I gotta give these guys bonus points for offering pork belly, seeing as to how most barbecue joints do not offer this as an option. I had to try the brisket though. It looked like it would be the most satisfying of the bunch of meats that they had. The meat itself has a nice charring from the smoking. The smoke ring is pretty much all smoke, and not comprised too much of rub/seasoning. I'd have preferred a stronger taste from the smoke ring, but it was really more on the subtle side. As for the texture of the meat, it was a truly beautiful cut of meat. There was a perfect fat to muscle ratio, however given this perfect ratio, the brisket was not as tender as I'd have hoped for a higher-fat-content cut than what I'm used to. It was still very delicious, but I cannot say it's the best brisket I've ever had. The sauces were good, not great. The spicy/smoky sauce had a good flavor and a surprising amount of heat to it. The regular sauce was good, but really lacking that punch. I guess if you mix the two, you're pretty much good to go. I did not try their carolina, nor horseradish sauces. The baked beans looked great. They were only good. Like Blake W. mentioned, this place is no southern BBQ, but I would concur in that it might be the best you can get in Brooklyn. It's still a great establishment, and a quarter pound of meat runs you $4, add a side for roughly $3.50, and a beer for $5 (which is a great deal considering the crazy brews they have!). It'll run ya just shy of $14 when all's said and done. I wish this place had sweet tea. They also have a super impressive whiskey collection.

This Brooklyn BBQ is murder! ?Tasty, tasty murder. ?The party got there early to snag a table and sampled four or five types of meat. ?I can't remember everything they ordered, but we had veal sausage, beef ribs, pulled pork, baby back ribs and some other assorted meat stuff as well as a full tray of sides (rolls, baked beans, kraut, pickles and potato salad). ?My belly was in meat heaven. ?The beef ribs fell off the bone while everything else had such great flavor. ?Everyone else is correct to skip the sauce and sides. ?They simply take up space in your tummy that would be better left for BBQ. ?Wash it down with some great local beers that come in sizes between 1/2 pint to 1 gallon (yeah - try that on for size) and an extensive selection of bourbon, whiskey and rye. ? Overall, the location is small but the food was awesome, the alcohol well selected. ?A must try for meat lovers. ?Just don't eat for three days before going to leave plenty of room.

Fette Sau = Fat Pig auf Deutsch. And I was a very fat pig after I left this spot. A barely moving fat pig. We got to this hipster, Texas style BBQ early (which I highly recommend). By 7pm there's a line forming and nowhere to sit. They have a cool looking down home space. All the cuts are painted on the walls which is endlessly interesting to look at. The bar has it's own concoctions/ales/and a serious whiskey list. The meat counter worker was really helpful and loaded down a tray of meats that included the most Berkshire pork belly I have ever seen in a pile. The brisket was pretty dry (as is the case most times) but they have three sauces to keep it all wet. The ribs were great. The pork shoulder was great. The sides were not necessary. Save your money unless you NEED to get sides. They are unnecessary for me at a BBQ place. Show me the meat. Overall, this place is great and I will be back if I'm ever in need of an early dinner in a pinch out in Williamsburg. I fear getting there later at night might get too crowded for the communal picnic tables to enjoy yourself.

I love this place. ?Like terrible crack addiction love. ?I've been back more times than I can count after I first found this place and its late night menu while trying to find an after midnight eatery in the neighborhood. ?Fette Sau stands apart from the other barbecue restaurants in NYC trying to emulate some other style or region. ?Instead they take the best techniques and the best meats and makes them into something that, at least for me and my experiences with the barbecue of my home state, tastes and feels like authentic barbecue despite the regional ambiguities. This is the best barbecue restaurant in New York. ?The giant smoker that makes your clothes and hair smell like meat smoke for days. ?Their daily changing menu of classic barbecue meats (brisket, ribs, sausage) and ?their more adventurous cuts of meat (pork cheeks & tail, lamb shank, pork belly). ?Their local, solid beer and amazing bourbon selections. ?Communal seating and a local, rustic feel that reminds me of sitting in a small little barbecue joint on some back road in Texas. ?It all leads to me having to check myself several times a week from dropping in to eat some 'cue in the interest of not gaining 10 pounds every month. It really is a great celebration of meat and fat and great barbecuing techniques. ?The fat on the brisket and pork belly always melts in my mouth the way good barbecue should. ?Always a nice, thick smoke ring and flavor, plus their crazy good rub has me licking my fingers and wiping my rolls along the paper tray liner. ?Like I said, it's hard not to go here every week. The sauces are all nice, though a review I read a long time ago suggested mixing the 3 sauces together and I have to agree that it tastes better than any one alone. ?The "classic" barbecue sauce ?(seems like Texas BBQ style sauce to me) they have is a bit to sweet to me by itself. ?In all honesty, you don't really need sauce because the meat is so darn good. ? As for the sides, like a lot of good barbecue restaurants they are so meat-focused that the sides are just ok but second fiddle to the meat. ?Broccoli Salad is one of the stand outs, as are the Burnt End Baked Beans chock full of crispy brisket/pastrami ends. ?I like pickles with my barbecue but the pickles they have don't really go well with the meats; local and delicious pickles yes, but too briny and abrasive to go with the complex flavors of their smoky meats. The staff is really nice and helpful. ?Barbecue and hospitality go hand in hand in my book. ?Just tell them how many people you have and what meats you want and they can guide you through the process of ordering how much meat you want to eat by pounds, something unfamiliar to some Northerners. Every time a friend comes and visits from Texas I take them there and they go from being skeptical to falling in love after the first bite. ?One of my last converts insisted on picking up a couple of pounds of pork belly to take on the plane trip home. ?I imagine there were some jealous people on his plane. ?Anywhere that's a 5 minute walk from my doorstep where I can eat hunks of meat with my hands is fine by me. ?And the pork belly. ?Sweet Jesus the pork belly. *Barbecue Tip: They open at 5pm and you should get there as early as you can because when they're out, they're out; plus barbecue always tastes better fresher rather than sitting under heat lamps for hours.

While more affordable than Fatty 'Cue, this place is better at late-night sliders and delicious craft beers than at meats. The sides are generally decent, but the brisket was greasy or dry-- never that succulent, marinated quality that you'd seek in a brisket. The sliders are worth the wait, and the beer is too, but if you're in the hood jonesing for a real meal and it's not too late, Siam Orchid offers cozier atmosphere and tastier fare for about the same price. And if you want BBQ and have money to spend on local meats, trot the eight blocks to Fatty Cue and wrap your mandibles around some more meltworthy beast.

Love the concept of a big warehouse full of smoked meat sold by the pound with great beer and cocktail offerings. Waiting in line is no biggie if you're with friends and have a Bourbon Bloom cocktail in hand. Unfortunately, the meat just didn't measure up. The brisket was dry, the ribs were ok, but not fall off the bone amazing and the sausage was nothing special. The burnt ends beans were amazing and the atmosphere, cocktails and beer and concept is great. I think I'm becoming a smoked meat snob...

I'm not a huge fan, and I don't understand the overall appeal of this place..... Maybe I don't know good bbq, when I taste it, but all I know is this place is just ok, and I wasn't as impressed as others. -Ok bbq -nasty coleslaw -ok baked beans -fast service -communal tables (HATE those) -Bar (love that) -Cafeteria trays instead of actual plates (on the fence about that) But you don' have to take my word for it...check it out yourself.

I really enjoyed our meal at Fette Sau. I like the quick service, casual dining, and good smoked meats. Not the best BBQ I have ever had, but I love that you can get a little of everything. TIPS - The main thing to do is snag a table before you order, or send one person to order while another gets a table. - Definitely don't be shy to ask the server how much of what you should order. - Don't be a buzz kill and get turned off by the fatty meat cuts. Smoked meats need the fat to say moist - Fette Sau understands that! - Toddler approved, my daughter loved the brisket and the rolls. Quick service was key to her happiness. WHAT WE ATE - Loin chops, never had smoked chops before, the pink can be off putting, but they ended up being our favorite. Super juicy, lots of flavor. Plus my daughter likes to naw on the bone. - Pork belly was nice and fatty, I think it took a year off my life, but it was worth it. - Sirloin tips, definitely good, but not my favorite, I would opt for something else next time. -Brisket was really perfect, couldn't ask for more. - The baked beans are outstanding, and worth the trip alone. Spicy and meat filled. - German potato salad was tasty, but I prefer my german potato salad to be warm, this was ice box cold. Next time we go I hope they have sausage and ribs, cause I would love to sample those.

Wow...that's all there's to say about Fette Sau. OK, not really... Food: Tender, juicy brisket that's packed with flavor. Check. ZOMG Melt-in-your-mouth Pork Belly. Check. Falsely-advertised Burnt Ends Baked Beans (wth, we couldn't find any beans!). Check. Drinks: Great local craft beers with possibly the most awesome tap handles ever. Check. Whiskey flights longer than some lesser bars' beer list. Che... wait didn't get to try this one, guess it's time for another visit! The best part of the meal: Server goes up to the board, erases one item (chicken, I think) to make room for the day's new item, which was...Berkshire Bacon(!!), and immediately receives a standing ovation from the whole dining area. Yes, get some.

So I actually live in Virginia and New York which gives me some perspective on BBQ. ?Getting BBQ in New York usually is a depressing experience, because it is almost always better anywhere in Virginia or the South for that matter. ?But this place is pretty darn good! ?And the selection is authentic. ?Pork Belly? ?I'm in love! So yes, stop #3 on Oriana's infamous beer bar crawl was a success, and it was well placed in the itinerary. ?The pork belly is very fatty and delicious. ?Definitely recommend. ?I also really liked their homemade sausage. ?Additionally, I had their baked beans which had pieces of barbequed meat in it. ?This was good but not as outstanding as everyone seemed to think it was, and it was surprisingly more expensive than the meat selections. ?In addition to the BBQ, they do have a bar there to help wash everything down in the proper way, and the place is just really cool. ?I loved the meat murals. ?I probably should have bought a t-shirt -- definitely want to go back!

Another example of New York BBQ... My boyfriend got the pork ribs and hated them. I had the pulled pork which was okay, but the vinegar sauce! It tastes like straight up malt vinegar. I was not impressed with the texture of the meat. But I did really like the pickles. And the beer/whiskey selection is awesome. Also, the staff was very helpful in knowing how much I needed (I'm not educated on how many lbs of food to order) This place is probably pretty good for overall New York BBQ. I think it is extremely over-hyped. I guess if you are stuck in Williamsburg and want BBQ and picnic tables, this would be your place.

Jaysus, the pork jowls were the most delciously splendid moist fatty delectable BBQ that ever I ate. Everything else, not so much. The pork chops were overdone and dry. The beans were tasty, with chunks of pork sausage swimming in the sauce, the other sides did not catch my eye or tastebuds. Keep your eyes peeled for those that hit the front of the line to cut in rather than queuing up as one should. Also, have a friend get your seating as you order. We had some minor drama procuring a spot which worked out alright for my party but not for the young couple with a baby that arrived just after us. Bone up on portions before you go. Ordering meat by the pound is a tricky thing. Most I saw ordered more than they could eat which didn't seem to stop them from trying. When in Rome, do as the Roman's, when at Fette Sau, be a fat pig.

I believe this place is overrated. It is a great place to hang out and grab a beer because of the atmosphere. Like others have said, the meat is weighed by the pound. Everything can add up to be costly and when I went most meats were around 18/lb. The pork belly was juicy and crispy on the outside. It was the best meat that I've tried. The ribs were a bit dry and did not have much flavor, so it was disappointing. The pulled pork also was a bit dry and I had to add bbq sauce in order to prevent the hiccups. Overally, I don't think this place is worth the money. I'd rather go to RUB and have better ribs.

Thought I'd died and gone to heaven. ?I'm from down in Kentucky originally, so I've rarely if ever been impressed with BBQ in NYC. ?This is good stuff. ?As another person alluded to, the pork belly is something you want to marry and not even keep another woman on the side. ?You can practically drink it with a straw! ?It's a little rich for large portions, so the pulled pork is also a great bet. ?Hell, it was the first BBQ pastrami I've EVER liked. ? Now, the bourbon selection. ?Like I said, from Kentucky, home of bourbon. ?There were varieties I'd never even heard of. ?Wow. ?And the 'tender was knowledgeable and, once he could tell I knew my shit, friendly. I send kisses, maybe creepy kisses, to Fette Sau.

Combining a BBQ pit and a bar, who thought of this idea and why didn't I think of it first?? I love this place for many reasons.... the aroma of bbq that fills the entire bar, the "Whisky Flights" ( three shots of different whiskeys for $10-15), the painted diagrams of cuts of beef all over the walls, the fake fireplace tv, the banquet hall seating tables that comprise the whole space (good for getting rowdy), the good beers (sunbock ale is awesome), the BBQ!! You really can't go wrong with a bar that sells beer by the gallon ( like milk).

Hey kids! Do you like THE SMELL OF SMOKED MEATS? Do you like SITTING AT A LONG WOODEN TABLE, LIKE VIKINGS? Do you like HELPING YOURSELF TO MASSIVE QUANTITIES OF PORK AND BEEF? Do you like GROWLERS OF BEER? Then you will like Fette Sau. It is stripped down, excellent barbecue. For a meat-eater, the smell when you walk in is intoxicating. You order meat by the pound(/quarter pound/half pound), so if you've been to Hill Country you know the drill. I thought the selection of sides was a bit limited, but maybe that's for our own safety. I had the German Potato salad, which was good, but not fantastic. I think I would have liked it a LOT better warm. Of course when you're there it's all about the pork, really. I had the pulled pork shoulder, and it was excellent. Pile it onto a complimentary potato roll or shovel it into your mouth with a fork (or do both, like I did!) ?A squirt of some of their barbecue sauce doesn't hurt, although the dry rub IS delicious. (PS I love mustard, but their German mustard is so hot that it tastes like goddamn murder). All in all, definitely a worthwhile trip, though I recommend going during the week and/or slightly earlier than peak hours (say before 8) to give you a better chance of having a seat. Williamsburgers are skinny but they will fight a bitch for a table.

We got there at 5:03pm on a Saturday. 5pm for dinner!? why would you do that? Thirty minutes later I realized why..the place was so packed there were people lining up around two walls. Watch out, seating is cutthroat so get there early. I wouldn't say its the best bbq I've ever had, but its pretty darn good...combine that w/great beer, good stuff. mmm...pork belly, brisket, baked beans, and the collards are probably the best items on the menu. (We ordered each item). ?We ordered about 1/3 pound of each for 8 people, and found it wasn't enough so ordered half pound more of brisket and pork belly.

I was about to take off a star for the lack of tables and the slowness of the line for food, however, it all worked out pretty well. ?I'll definitely come back during the summer months. ?It was a perfect night to drink from a nice selection of whiskey and eat some awesome BBQ.

One of the best tasting Barbecue joints I have eaten at in my life. The Pulled Pork is comparable to Allen & Sons off of 15/501 in North Carolina, except slightly drier. The Ribs are amazing, in one word, succulent! The Brisket is tender, slightly dry at times, but good as far as Brisket goes outside of Texas! Could use a little bit more smoke. I assume that it depends when you get the brisket out of the cooker, since brisket tends to change over short periods of time. The best part of my meals here have always been the baked beans!!! I mean they really outdid any other place I have ever had beans at. Do you like beans, if you do, you'll love them, if you don't, you'll still love them, YES they are that good! Their selection of Beer is unique, but very suiting, they have exactly what fits with the down home atmosphere of the sprawling beer hall style tables and benches. It's as if they are telling you to "Come on in, make yourself at home, and have a Jug of some sweet Brew." And if you don't like brew, they always have a huge selection of bourbons and whiskeys that could make a knowledgeable man foam at the mouth. I prefer the place during the summer time, cause nothing says summer more than Beer and Barbecue, but in the winter there is a nice fireplace that has seasonal images or fireplace DVDs running that make you feel all warm inside. Overall - 5 stars A++

Not too far from my house, I walked here on Saturday night, hoping to try before the place got crowded. ?I arrived at 6:40 and had some trouble opening the door as people were leaning on it. The place was packed!!! Once I got inside, I was super impressed with the rustic, calculated feel of the restaurant, auto-body shop meets Dr. Quinn's outdoor restaurant from the show meets the Hoffbrau House in Newport, Kentucky. We had ambitious eating plans, and the meat man, contrary to some reviews was super helpful and explained everything we needed to know about the different cuts of meat and portioning. Hovering for a table didn't seem like something we were interested in so we just got takeout. We ordered pulled pork, brisket, berkshire pork cheeks, tongue pastrami and two large orders of baked beans. We walked out with enough food. ?Having asked for barbecue sauce we were assured that there would be plenty. When we got home there was as much barbecue sauce as you would get Parmesan cheese with an order of spaghetti. Luckily my friend had some other sauce we used and i slathered the brisket in the bake beans. I give three stars because the pulled pork was great. ?Melt apart with plenty of pink pork goodness. This was especially good with the vinegar based barbecue sauce they gave us. Tongue pastrami and pork cheeks were pretty good too for their wow factor. Brisket was not so good. ?Irregularly cut, I preferred the thin cuts to the gelatinous thick slabs that snuck up on me. So when I go next time, I'll be eating in and using the barbecue sauce on the tables. I also want to try the pickles, they looked really good as did the beer they sell. I look forward to upping the stars on my next visit. ?Its clear these guys are doing something right as the place is always packed.

Ate at Fette Sau the other night and honestly thought it was the best BBQ I've ever had. ?And yes -- I've had BBQ in TX, TN, PA, NC and many other places. I can't even tell you what I liked best, but the pulled pork, ribs and pastrami were amazing. ?The sausage was great, too. ?The broccoli, kraut and potatoes were also really good. Great beer and bourbon menu, too. I wish it were a little cheaper, but ... sometimes you pay for excellence in NYC.

Really chill spot that serves about the best BBQ you can get north of the Carolinas. Be prepared to wait in line, but also be prepared for the awesome brisket, pulled pork and pork belly that awaits once you get inside. ?The meats are the obvious stars, and the selection varies from what I can tell, depending on how fast people make a run on any given pig part that day, or maybe just that they can only make a fixed amount each day. ?I hope the ribs, beef cheeks and pork shoulder are on the menu next time I make it out. Decent sides and a few good beers to choose from. Besides the actual bbq, though, I think the best part of this spot is the ambience of the building and the way things are layed out. ?You stand in line next outdoor tables, and once inside, you sort of snake around the edges of an old, cavernous, converted warehouse/garage-looking space to get your food and drink, and then find some space at the community picnic tables, which are all in the middle. ?Very cool use of the space and a really laid back atmosphere with a brilliant blown up butcher's diagram of a pig on one wall, showing where each part comes from! Summertime in Williamsburg never had it so good.

The atmosphere is great- picnic tables, LCD fireplace, smoke in the air... but the food is not overwhelmingly delish. ?The BBQ sauce comes in squeeze bottles on the table- cold sauce on hot meat is not a great combo. ?Usually, in a real BBQ place, the sauce is served hot, laddled over the meat by request or on the side in a paper cup. ?Also, the BBQ sauce was not that great. ? The meat... the pork ribs and brisket were really tasty. ?The pulled pork so so and the chorizo so so. ?We got broccoli on the side- and it was very odd tasting and greasy. Also... you will smell like smoke after going !!!!

When I walked in, I felt German. ?Red faces are singing out loud together holding a cup of beer. I saw mostly hip bearded young men loving their meat eating. I loved what I saw. On my aluminum cafeteria try with white sheet of paper on top consisted of a spicy pork sausage, sauerkraut and broccoli salad. I made my plate German. The sausage was tough and found nothing special. I ate with mustard but did not help. Sauerkraut tasted pre-packed store brand. Broccoli salad needed salt & pepper and garlic over power the dish for me. Unfortunately I did not try any meat. I was not hungry that night. I would go back for the space, people and its energy.

What a neat bbq place! Definitely a unique place, and a must-go for BBQ newbs like me. Set-up is in a warehouse filled with benches & includes bar. Reminds me of a giant picnic spot, except instead of sun, you get dim lighting filled with people. This place definitely the place to be if you're looking for BBQ. Not usually much of a meat eater, I could definitely say thumbs up to everything they had. We ordered sausage, sauerkraut, 1/4 lb (the min you can order) of everything except the lamb all served on a gigantic try, and it was mouth-watering good. I also am a fan of the free sauces & the buns. The only vice I saw was the LINE. Since it's self-serve, there were about 10 people ahead of us, and it took about an HOUR for us to finally order. The wait felt like forever as we were standing in line. So, either get there early or be prepared to play phone games for an hour. Perhaps they need to come up with a way to service faster.

First Impression: Take out I recommend the pulled pork, the brisket, and the whole pig, if they've got it. ?That little porker was so succulent, it shocked us all. ?I'd also say that the burnt end beans were delicious but the slaw was vinegar-based and overwhelming. Anything else? My dining compatriots all remarked about how certain things were spicy, but I didn't notice, so I can only imagine that they are wusses.

This is one of NYC's premiere bbq places; which means its pretty good food but a pretty hipster-y crowd these days. The place has a very dark decor with dim lighting and some screens with a fire on it. In the back there is a large bar with with a huge assortment of whiskey and a fair amount of beer on tap. The food is delicious but if youre from the South, it is... different and maybe not the most delicious you've ever had.. 1. Pork Shoulder - Well seasoned with a crust and was soft, a little less marbled than I thought it would be but good. 2. Berkshire Belly - Delicious cut of fatty meat with a dark roasted crust 3. Pork Ribs- This was an alright rib but I thought that the other meats were better than the ribs here 4. Ham - Pretty good ham, not much else to state 5. Sausage - Being in Texas from time to time, I usually love the links but the ones here are just not as good as the ones down there. But the spicyness of the sausage that I had made it worth the try 6. Bershire Cheeks - soft cuts of meat which are worth the try if you go 7. Brisket - soft and smoked but again similar to the shoulder, I thought it would be more marbled but it was surprisingly lean 8. Pastrami - Ribs - Had to try this because in Texas these are a hit... and theyre just as good here (if you order this get ready for a pretty big rib) That pretty much sums up the menu, Im a little critical but if you've had a lot of barbeque then it makes sense.... The sides are touted by people who go here and when i went the only thing i actually tried were the pickles and the beans; the pickles were from Guss' and they were pretty good but I did not like the beans so much. The beans were a little sweet and they had burnt ends in it but I found that the ends made it a little bitter and it turned me off. For desert they offer Nunu Chocolates (local caramel/chocolate place) and Steves Key Lime (a local pie place which is a really good key lime place)

How have I walked by this place so many times and never known it was there? I feel ashamed to call myself a Williamsburg lover without having been lured by the succulent scent of slow cooked meat until now. Located on Metropolitan Ave just south of the Bedford stop sandwiched between places like Roebling Tea Room and my beloved Saltie, Fette Sau would appear to be just like any other nondescript alleyway if it weren't for the hour long line of people spilling onto the sidewalk. Fette Sau has always been on my mental list of places to try and the hour long wait was trying but well worth it. The waiting probably added to my enjoyment given my ravenous demeanor by the time I ordered my pounds of meat and sides. I was sad to not see the pork belly on the menu but I figured the pork jowl would be a worthy substitute for the day. My friend and I shared the following: - Brisket: Wow. Such solid flavor. Every bite was good, whether you get crispier, fattier, or leaner bites.. this was one of the best briskets I've had. Tasted good with and without sauce. - Pork Jowl: I had to google this in line but jowl is the cheek. If you look at it sliced, it actually just looks like a slab of pork belly or bacon given all the fat that is marbled throughout. I thought this was quite delicious but obviously very rich and indulgent. The 1/4 pound I ordered was definitely enough for my friend and I just to get a taste of it. - Pulled Pork Shoulder: Extremely dry which is not what you would expect from any pulled pork. I tried saving it with adding some sauce and putting it inside the bun to make my own pulled pork slider but the pork shoulder was still extremely dry and flavorless. - Potato Salad: Really solid. It uses a vinegar based dressing that works really well as a change of pace to the heavy meat options. - Broccoli Salad: I really enjoyed this. Long broccoli spears, sharp garlic and scallions, and a similar (if not the same) vinegar dressing used to dress the potato salad. - Pickles: I like pickles but I actually could only stomach one bite. The pickles had an overpowering clove or juniper flavor that I wasn't accustomed to with no other flavors or sweetness that carried through after. I was thoroughly impressed with my meal. I would definitely come back to try the pork belly (wasn't on the menu when I went) and the baked beans. Sure the wait isn't ideal but if you think about it, once you get to the front, you get your food instantly and then can dig in right after. You can also grab drinks from the bar to tide you over while in line.

A vegetarian's nightmare but a meat eater's delight! I love it. I'm a light meat eater, so whenever I go to Fette Sau it feels like binging. It's great. The vibe is super casual and seating is communal. The meat they serve is by weight and by golly, it's aplenty and delicious. I generally share with a friend since you can get so much for such an affordable price. And don't just get the meat - get the sides! Especially the beans! Meat beans!

After endless BBQ searches in Brooklyn, my fiance's co-workers invited us out for dinner at Fette Sau. The second you open the door - you start to drool. ?Im not kidding. ?My glasses became fogged up with the heat that was coming from this place. ?I wanted to eat. We got a pint (served in jars) at the bar (about 10 different microbrews and they offer beer in all size, including to-go gallons - NICE!). ?It did take about 20min to scope out some people that were leaving a table but it was well worth the wait. ?After snaking the table, we ordered (no waitresses here). ?I ordered the pork belly beacause I have never tried it and also - Ive heard so many great things about it. First thing I saw when I got the pork belly was glistening fat. ?Now, I usually skeeve any fat on my meat and spit it out, but I tried this and wow. ?OMFG wow. ?The fat literally liquifies in your mouth. ?Its so decadent. ?We also ordered the baked beans, a sausage link and the ribs. ?SO FREAKING GOOD. ?The best part - all that food for $22. I felt so guilty when I got home though. ?Im supposed to go and try on wedding dresses this weekend. ?There goes the diet - all I can think of is - When will be my next trip to Fette Sau?

MEEEAAAT!!! And lots of it. ?If you're a lover of 4-legged yumminess, then this is your place. I came here with my boyfriend (always my partner-in-crime) and two friends who were visiting us from Paris. ?Now, our other Parisian friend, who had a one year stint living in Manhattan, swears by Dallas BBQ. He loves it so much that he instructed our guests to seek out this treasure. And I was like, "really?!?! Dallas BBQ?!" So bf and I challenged this notion and brought them to the real BBQ heaven. Ambience: It's al fresco dining meets German beer hall. ?Communal tables are on a first come, first served basis so don't be shy and squeeze in next to some new friends. It's amazing how many people you can fit at one table with a little pork belly grease. Make sure you grab a spot in the food order line while you send out one of your troopers to wrangle a table. ? Food: The bf is a glutton. We had decided on the pork belly, brisket AND two sausages. At the last minute he begged me to approve an extra order of ribs. Sure, why not? I laugh in the face of calories! 3 lbs. of BBQ'd goodness. Pork belly, pork belly... oh how I love thee. It was delicious! Just the right amount of fat to meat ratio and perfectly grilled. The brisket was juicy and tender. I'd skip out on the ribs. Not very meaty and on the dry side. ?The baked beans are definitely a hit! ?One order is enough for two people. Our fatty selves thought we could actually finish two. Ooops. ? We also ordered the sauerkraut which was way too dry and zero flavor. The pickle didn't tickle my pickle either. ?And of course we had dessert! The key lime pie was decent but nothing memorable about it. Beer: Our friend "accidentally" ordered a gallon. But naturally we had no problems finishing this along with another half gallon. ?They make their own brews which is also another plus. Our friends thoroughly enjoyed the place and will report back to Paris what real BBQ tastes like.

From the mad foodie genius behind Williamsburg beer showcase Spuyten Duyvil, Fette Sau replaces an obsession for imported, hard-to-pronounce brews with imported, much-easier-to-pronounce bbq (and bourbon). Located across the street from Duyvil in a converted garage, this spot has the promise to rival Dinosaur, Daisy May and, uh, Blue Smoke for the city's top smokehouse honors. (Danny Meyer needs to check this out STAT for a lesson in decor, atmosphere and straight-up personality, because Smoke looks like a TGI McChilis next to this unique space). But a fun environment doesn't win bbq championships, succulent Hand Pulled Pork Shoulder does, and Fette Sau hits its mark with a pitch-perfect combination of fat, flesh and smoke on their Berkshire ($15/pound). The enormous (and perfectly butchered--fat is your friend!) Beef Ribs also impressed ($22 for a full rack) as well as the Baby Back Pork Ribs, featuring a tasty nutmeg/cinnamon rub coating the pink meat. We also ordered a half rack of the Baby Backs and regretted the decision instantly. Fortunately we were smarter with the meaty Brunt End Baked Beans ($8 for the large container). There were some misses though. The Brisket was dry and gamey and the sausages ($1.75 a link) were just unremarkable--I would suggest focusing more on the smoking process and starting with a banger that has much less gristle, because these were tough. But at around $20/head for a gut-busting amount of smoked meat washed down with a nice selection of cheap to insanely-expensive grain alcohol, I can't think of a better way to absolutely void the 12 miles you logged on the treadmill the week prior.

The pork belly. ?Eat the pork belly. ?You will die and go to heaven. ?The sausage was meh for me, even though still good (on a separate note i think it tasted italian?). ?I've had better brisket but theirs is still very well made. ?The pork shoulder, too, was unbearably delicious and fatty although at the same time, nothing overly remarkable. But THE PORK BELLY. ?The pork belly is where it's at. ?You bite into it, and the molten fat drips down. ?The meat is tender, from being surrounded by fat, and as you swallow you imbibe fat. ?Your eyes roll back into your head, a sexual moan escapes your lips. ?Fueled by the burning flames of pork fat passion you feast away. ?At some point you feel a little sick, from all of that grease gurgling away inside. ?But then you keep eating. ?And then there comes a time when you are full, but there is still some on your plate. ?You want to eat it, but you want to save it for tomorrow, too. ?You nibble a little bit more, packing yourself as full as possible, then pack it away for breakfast. And then in the morning you curse yourself for not having had the willpower to save more of it because what you were eventually able to save from yourself is not nearly enough to satisfy. I can't wait to go back and get a full pound of that sweet, sweet crack. ?And also try the cheeks and pastrami and, well, everything else.

As I ate my meat dish on a tray at this incredibly ornate, funky, and yes meaty place, my mind followed a clear train of thought that went something like, "Now THAT'S what I'M talkin about" ... followed by ?"Now THHAAAT'S what III'MM talkin about" and then also "Now THHAAAAAAAAATTTT'S what IIII'MMM talkin about!" Seriously, I was licking my tongue around my teeth like a cat as I walked away from this joint with a serious new respect for the undeniable value of MEAT to the dietary spectrum of the human animal. I just ordered a 1/4 pound of brisket and 1/4 pound of boneless ribs, and I was ALL GOOD... $8. Superb. And 5 more stars for the simple originality of this new favorite beefeteria.

What can be said that hasen't already been said? I'm not sure but all I know is that Fette Sau was worth the wait this past Saturday. The line was out the door but the great selection of NY area beers helped pass the time quickly. I recently ate at Hill Country BBQ and American Ice Company in DC and Fette Sau beat them in pretty much every catagory. I don't think I'll ever have thick cut bacon like they serve up here. The brisket was extremely tender and the pulled pork was top notch. The staff behind the counter were very helpful and made sure you didn't order too much food because everything is weighed by the pound. I went in with 4 people, we spent around 20 a head on food and we all left full. I'm going back soon and bring some more friends, and please try the bacon, you'll be happy you did.

When I can stuff myself like a fat pig on delicious cuts of pork for $20 even, I don't give a damn if this is authentic bbq or some strange German hybrid. Pass me that pure-fat pork belly, some smoked pork sausage, pulled pork, and juicy brisket, and I'll happily deal with cramped picnic tables and breeding hipsters and their spawn. We got all that plus two cups of delicious baked beans with burnt ends, a pile of potato rolls, tasty german potato salad, half sour pickles, and one lone spear of overly red peppery broccoli, and we were all stuffed to the point of explosion. Did I mention it only cost $20 a person? What a steal. I would say that ordering everything by the pound is tricky, because it is easy to over or underestimate how much you need. In our case, we ordered too much, and overate as a result. I'd rather their be a standard "order size" that you could work with, because I think that could help alleviate the problem. As it was, I was super excited to see Steve's Key Lime Pie on the menu, but by the time I was ready for dessert it was no longer a possibility, thanks to my swollen stomach. In any event, we loved our family style pork feast, although we did feel compelled to walk all the way over the williamsburg bridge and up to union square in order to compensate for all the fatty goodness we had consumed. Eating at Fette Sau is definitely not for the faint of heart!

Who knew you could get good bbq up north? I didn't think it was possible. I sure stand corrected. The brisket is flavorful and moist. Even the fatty bits that I usually can't eat were delicious and melty. The little burned bits were exceptionally tasty. The rub is not too salty either (I appreciate that). The ribs were juicy and tender. Not falling off the bone but good and sturdy. For sides we had their house made pickle, which I have to say I'm not a huge fan of, unfortunately. The salt to vinegar/sugar ratio was a bit off leaving it a little briney. However the beans were full of delicious meat bits and not lacking anything in the flavor department. Beer by the gallon? Why yes please. And very reasonably priced. I will miss this place when I go back home.

Is it authentic? ...NO ? Is it organic and/or family owned heritage breed animals, smoked to succulent perfection using utterly mouthwatering dry rubs ? you better bet your ass Pork Shoulder, Ribs, Brisket, Pastrami (if you're lucky enough to catch them on a pastrami day) and Pork Belly are all on some next-level-shit. ?Each bite melts in your mouth.....intoxicating you like some sort of animal flesh derived crack rock. ? Ordering by the pound means you can try a little bit of everything. ?KEY for an indecisive person like myself, faced with the TUFFEST lineup of meats I've ever seen in my life. ? All of the sides are great, but listen carefully now.....if you go to Fette Sau and do not order the baked beans - you've seriously got some life-evaluation to do. ?They cook the baked beans with huge pieces of burnt ends. ?These baked beans are seriously GANGSTER. ?Most batches include huge chunks of SEVERAL meats. ?I could go and make a meal out of just the baked beans alone. ? -Mini Martins potato rolls to make little sandwiches with. -Dozens upon Dozens of different Whiskeys. ? -5 different BBQ sauces on the table to compliment your food. -Incredibly cool atmosphere including diagrams of the different cuts of meats on the walls and a yuletide log burning on a giant flatscreen tv. -they usually have old cowboy music playing. The only downside is that you will wait a while for a table most nights of the week......but you can always bring it home! ?Enjoy!

This place would be very close to my idea of heaven....minus having to fight for a seat. Lord knows I do that enough on the subway. There's nothing like standing and awkwardly holding a giant lunch tray worth of meat, hovering over other people who are chit chatting and taking facebook pictures while lazily picking at their food. Every moment you stand there waiting, the food is getting colder and the beer is getting warmer. On top of that, the group that just got their tray 6 people after you guessed right and stood behind a group who finished quickly. Wait...does that kid's jacket have its own seat? I hope he paid extra for that. Definitely kick ass BBQ though. I'd like to play around with some non-peak times to get a different experience, but every time I come it's the same story. Do yourself a favor and get the pork belly...a lot of it.

I'm sure I am not the first to say this but Fette Sau actually means FAT SO! ?Hahahaha, kidding. But you will be a FAT SO by the time you leave. The bbq is delectable! OMG. I seriously cannot even begin to explain how EVERYTHING melts in your mouth. I will keep it short and sweet. Go here! Eat, drink and be merry! Do not, however, go on a Friday or Saturday night if you plan to actually sit down and dine at the restaurant.

After seeing this place featured on the Cooking Channel (you can slap me now), I thought, "Hey, let's check it out." And the food was solid. Ordered the brisket, some sweet sausages, baked beanz, and coleslaw. The coleslaw was not good. It had these huge chunks of apple that Mr. Magoo probably chopped up and too much vinegar. It's coleslaw, not douche. But the meats were good. The beans were delish. The sauces were yum. Your best bet is to either call in the order or eat at 4pm with your grandparents. Otherwise, there is a LONG-ASS line of annoying hipsters all the time and the service is slooooooooooooow. Wtf, are they on klonopin? Ooooh, they should have klonopin as a side. Just sayin'. You also get Martin's potato rolls with each order.

I'm pretty surprised this place only has a 3.5 star average, as I think their BBQ is pretty awesome, they have outdoor space with picnic tables, and they sell delicious microbrews from taps by the gallon. The only issues that I had with it are that food is served by the pound from a very small counter area where there's only really room for one person to work, so the line can get large quickly, and that there isn't much indoor space, so I'd probably reserve return trips here for nice weather days. The BBQ was really top notch. We had huge chunks of soft brisket, slices of massive boneless beef spare ribs, spicy sausages, pork ribs, and burnt end baked beans. All were really great, with the brisket being the highlight. They have a large slow cooker which apparently places in Manhattan cannot have due to some cockamamey rule, and their brisket certainly is tender and moist. The burnt end beans were a unique and excellent tough too. Their beer taps have all been fitted with knives as handles, which was a cute little touch. They pour really high quality draughts too, and you can get growlers or gallons. A gallon of microbrew for $32 kept six of us quenched during a sumptuous feast, so while the BBQ isn't exactly cheap (ours came out to $25 per man, so compared to Hill Country or Blue Smoke I guess it is a pretty good deal), the beer'onomics kind of compensates for that.

Atmosphere: Well designed casual atmosphere, conducive to conversation with friends and strangers. Beer: Laudable selection, quality and bargain priced. Whiskey selection: Impressive. Minced Pork: Not as tasty as Pies'n'Thighs (RIP?), gave a table full of people the green apple splatters. I'll avail myself of their beer & space again, but I don't think there's ever a good time for pork-induced dysentery.

Cholesterol is the least of your worries here...just make sure the defibrillator is behind the counter. This place is reminiscent of HILL COUNTRY, but with smaller portions. ?The atmosphere and presentation is somewhat the same where they charge you by the pound. ?The meats are extremely fatty so a side of yummy broccoli salad or bottle of coke is highly recommended to wash that fatty goodness down. ?Portions are pretty generous, but definitely not worth the price in my opinion when you're squeezing half the fat out. ?Is it better than HILL COUNTRY? ?Probably not, but for good tasty meats next to a fireplace TV in Billyburg I'm all in. ? Wish the coke was larger and there were more sides to choose from, but coming from a small place it packs a lot by the pound. ? Check it out, soak up the fat and begin feeling a tingling sensation in your left arm.

You know you're at a restaurant that cares more about quality than presentation when your meat comes on a tray and your beer comes in a gallon-sized glass jug. I can't wait till it's warmer out so I can chill outside with my giant tray of meat and lethal amount of beer. Although, for a BBQ place, I didn't really enjoy their sauces. A bit too strong for me.

Fette Sau is for lovers. Or love-ahs, as the Clarvins would say. ("The Clarvins" are Saturday Night Live characters played by Will Ferrell and Rachel Dratch) If you love barbecue as much as these love-ahs love their spiced meats, stop by Fette Sau for a delicious BBQ dinner experience. Visit on a warm evening where you can sit out on a communal bench with your love-ah under the moonlight. Before sharing this romantic meal with your dear one, step into the line and look at "Tonight's Meats." Items are crossed off as they run out throughout the night, so don't come too late. Like say, after a lusty romp in the meadow. Come before that. You and your love-ah may choose from many a delightful meat, including pulled pork, brisket and even pig tails. There are several sides to choose from, including the ever-popular baked beans and potato salad. Do not let the broccoli salad fool you; it is not a "salad," nor is it very good. Sandwich your love-ah's pulled pork into the roll provided with your hearty bounty. Be careful not to forget some barbecue sauce, specifically the ligher-colored bottle. The darker has a bit too much spice and will take away from the delectable pleasure your tastebuds receive from the food, not unlike the pleasure you receive from your love-ah. As you finish your meal of meat, gaze longingly into your darling's eyes while washing it all down with a refreshing beer. If you are feeling extra feisty, order a huge, affordable pitcher to share with fellow love-ahs. Upon finishing dinner, make sure to hold your love-ah in a long, sensual embrace under the glow of the moon... before heading home to submit to yours and your love-ah's desires, triggered by the BBQ-ecstasy you experienced at Fette Sau.

Showed up as a slight drizzle was coming down a few days ago. My friend/former boss and I had been daydrinking... all day... so it was time for some meat in our tummies. The ordering process was a bit like the cafeteria line in elementary school. Except at the end of this one I paid with my Visa instead of showing the cashier my card signifying I was a recipient of free lunch. (Poor girl issues! tmi? too bad.) The seperate bar for getting beer or drinkies is to the left of the meat and food counter. I appreciate this, as I sometimes blow the food all together and grab, like some gin soaked "dinner". Good call... We grab our tray of meat and potato salad/chips and decide to sit outside. Even though it's raining a little... a little water never hurt no one.... We were settled for all of about five minutes when a torrential downpour began. We made a mad dash for the tiny tiny tiny tiny area under the awning of their night roll down gate. it was kind of perfect. Noshing on beef tip and pulled pork, hearing and seeing ?thunder and lightning crash and flash, sipping a light ale.... Oh Fette Sau. Oh Brooklyn. (one star missing only cuz I couldn't fully enjoy my experience sitting outside. I understand the want for open air above your head when it's nice out... but hey guys it rains more days per calendar year here than it does in Seattle.

The BBQ was not bad here. Not my favorite in NYC, but definitely high up on the list. And what southern girl can't love a place that serves your beer in a mason jar? I mean, REALLY?!? I personally liked the cafeteria style, but didn't like the attitude from the server when my friends were a little confused on the ordering process. Ok, now I'm going to list why it's only just OK: -It's not cheap -The picnic table seating and the lack of seats once it gets crowded (you will get to know your table neighbor pretty well) -It's full (and I mean full) of hipsters, so if they aren't your thang, you're not going to have a good time Other than that, I really liked it, and will definitely come back a little bit earlier during dinner time rather than later to make sure there are enough seats for me and my friends. I don't know why everyone is voting that it's great for kids, when I was there on a Saturday evening, it was full of hipsters drankin' and getting their grub on - not a place I'd want to bring my kid and have them sitting right next to someone drinking heavily and swearing, but that's just my own personal opinion.

Hooo, dawg, is Fette Sau's pulled pork butt delicious. I stopped by with friends last night to share a pound of the moist, meaty goodness...plus a half-pound of brisket, two spicy pork sausages, some baked beans with burnt ends, broccoli salad, German potato salad, and a gallon o' wheat beer. It was quite a feast. Let's break it down: Brisket: Moist and tasty, but a little too fatty for my taste Pork Sawwwsages: Wished I'd ordered more just for myself Pulled Pork Butt: Amen. Broccoli Salad: A surprisingly tasty, refreshing addition to the plate Potato Salad: Also surprisingly tasty (I'm not usually a fan) Baked Beans: Eh. I'd skip these next time. They were a bit too thick and heavy-tasting--I wanted more vinegary bite (or something) Gallon o' Beer: How can you not love this? Four of us finished it off (mind you, we're not dainty drinkers; we could have shared with more people, but hey, it was there) Other thoughts? I liked the wooden-picnic-tables-stashed-behind-a-chain-link-?fence vibe; the place smelled amazing; and I loved the butchering diagrams painted onto the walls. Service was a bit aloof (the girl who rang us up had the too-cool-for-school, hipster sensibility down pat), but because you order your food at the counter and pay for it right there, we didn't really interact with the service staff for long. I loved the range of sauces available--a tomato-based Texas-style sauce, a hot barbecue sauce, and Carolina-style vinegar sauce. Despite my Texas upbringing, I couldn't get enough of that vinegar. I'll be back to Fette Sau, even knowing the place will be perpetually mobbed with the warm weather returning. Because, you know, sometimes nothing makes you feel better like a pound of barbecue and a gallon of beer.

Fuck...Yes Is it authentic Texas BBQ? ?No...but it's damn tasty. It's a touch fatty...but who gives a shit. ?It's BARBECUE. ?It's not health food. The beans are made with the drippings from the meat as it cooks for fuck's sake. Thankfully, the hipster vibe gets put on-hold in this place...which is nice. ?You can't wear skinny-girl jeans and eat this much MEAT at the same time. Unless you plan on purging afterward. ?And I wouldn't do that...on purpose. Order yourself a giant Mason Jar of beer, a shot of bourbon, then pile on a mountain of meats, beans, and some tater salad. Oh...and I do agree...put some cornbread on the menu. ?Seriously...that's just bbq 101.

Everyone and I mean everyone has been talking up this BBQ joint. My very enthusiastic friend even went as far as to say that they have the best BBQ in the entire city, along with many of the reviewers here. So logically, some friends and I trekked out to BillyBurg for a huge meal and whiskey! Upon walking in I was smitten with the ambiance and overall aesthetic of the restaurant. Unassuming and overtly Williamsburg, my friends and I nestled into some seats and sent some scouts to gather grub for the table. I am not really a picnic-style seating kinda guy, its hard to have constructive conversation when the person at the end is trying to talk and everyone else can't really engage. So that was a bit annoying. So the food. Everything is served lunch room style. Meaning the meat is all showcased and you make your selection visually. The meat is then cut to your specifications and served on a big ass tray. Ordering meat by the pound is a bit daunting and makes for an interesting gastrointestinal journey. I happily ordered the brisket, pulled pork shoulder and a spicy sausage. The pulled pork was a let down because it was cold, the brisket was obviously bbq'd perfectly, but I requested a lean cut and got a large amount of fat on it. The spicy sausage wasn't really anything to write home about. Upon returning to the table I found a huge jug of beer. Life couldn't be more perfect. The beer was decent, the brisket was really really greasy and the sausage was mediocre. Overall, I was a bit disappointed. I expected a lot more from this place and instead what I got was an interesting venue in a garage that served room-temperature bbq. The beans were delicious and the buns were scrumptious. But if this is what everyone is claiming to be the best bbq in the city, then I'm much more inclined to head to Arthur's Tavern in Hoboken for some ribs. In ending, this place isn't terrible. It's a fun time and I enjoyed myself thoroughly, just not my favorite, plus the whiskey selection is great!

I think this place has a great selection of beer and the meat is good. I love their brisket and it just kind of melts in your mouth.

There's nothing more for me to say other than what's already been said here. I just want to make sure all the strangers on this website know I am part of the Fette Sau club and I'm not some Philistine who has never been a part of this whole BBQ craze. I go here and swim around in pig heaven. After I eat here I don't really care if the pork belly ensconces my heart in a tomb overnight and hardens, causing my heart to stop and making me die. It's really no thing - the brisket and belly and shoulder are all worth it. I recommend getting a bourbon mule this time of year as well!

The lines can be kind of a pain for this place and sometimes they dont really have the goods, but if they have the beef short ribs or the pork belly, get 2 pounds of each, eat as much as you can, then eat that shit at home for the rest of the week. the best.

Dayyyyyum. My roomie and I went to Fette Sau last night for the first time. The space is sooo cute, but it was packed so we got take out (luckily we live right around the corner). There are three long picnic tables, and it would be a great place to go with a bunch of friends if you could get enough seating, but it seems like its always that packed. We shared half a pound of brisket, a quarter pound of pork belly, a side of burnt end baked beans and a side of dante's german potato salad. Everything was absurdly amazing. The whole thing came out to $26. A ridiculously delicious BBQ dinner for $13 each - need I say more??

After literally years of being told I must visit this former auto-garage-turned-BBQ joint, I finally made it to Fette Sau. The place is fun, with a nice service gimmick - that being the whole "food served directly on the tray" thing. I can see seating being a nightmare on the more lovely spring and summer days (the majority of seats being picknick tables outside in the alley), though after the incomparable amount of time I've spent waiting for tables at Dinosaur, I have to say FS was quite nice. The food was pretty good overall - in comparison to Dinosaur, I'd say it was a mixed bag. Some things I liked better, others I did not. Ribs - these were good, but not great. I like Dinosaur's better, which tend to be juicier and are cooked with BBQ sauce. The version at FS were a little too charred on the outside (I like a good bark, but this was overcooked) and a bit dry on the inside. Pork Shoulder - fantastic! Juicy and delicious through and through. Needed no sauce whatsoever. Pork Belly - an interesting one. Being the fan of pork belly that I am, I immediately knew I must try BBQd belly, though the results were a bit mixed for me. Honestly it was the single most delicious thing on my plate (err, tray), but when you're paying by the lb, I don't know if choosing something that's 80% fat is the best way to go. I have to say though, those extra pieces of fat went great on the rolls, which were perfectly soft and airy. Sausage Links - not totally sure what meat they used in these (my guess is it was pork), but they were good. Fairly juicy, a little spicy, and a light snap when you bit into them. Potato Salad - this was a more German-style potato salad, meaning it was vinegar based as opposed to mayonnaise based. I really enjoyed it - tons of flavor from all the oil, vinegar, and whole grain mustard. Burnt End Baked Beans - deep red in color, a touch spicy, and filled with flavor. The addition of bay leaves and the burnt ends were very nice, however I tend to enjoy a slightly less al dente texture to my baked beans. I suppose it's a good thing that they weren't "mushy", but it made the dish feel a bit raw to me. Half-Sour Pickles - I have no idea if the restaurant makes these themselves or if they simply buy them. At first taste I enjoyed them quite a bit, as I love a good half-sour (my favorite pickle). But after a while I did notice how overly salty these were. I do know that Dinosaur makes their own pickles, and I quite prefer those. Overall I enjoyed the place quite a bit - the rotating menu of meats is a major reason to go back. Can't wait for a return visit!

Fette Sau is a meat paradise, with decor and atmosphere that accurately reflect the surrounding neighborhood. It gets busy, but with a little bit of hunting, we were able to get ~8 seats together for our group. Be prepared to wait, though, as since everything is carved to order, it can take a while.

Obviously I understand that the point of this place is meat (I am not an idiot). ?But I think it's important to say this: would it really hurt their image of BBQ paradise to have ONE vegetarian item on the menu? ?Even if they - for whatever inexplicable reason - are opposed to seitan or tempeh, would it kill them to throw a few vegetables on the grill? On the small chance that you are a non-meat eater yelping this place to determine if you can accompany your omnivorous friends to Fette Sau, I am here to tell you: no. ?There are pickles; that is all. ?In this day 'n age I expect better. ?(The beer, however, is excellent.)

Hands down, the best BBQ spot in NYC. ?There's a reason why this place is lined up with people shortly before its opening. The food is sooooo goood, and there's like a gazillion kinds of whiskey and bourbon. Chill crowd and friendly servers = good times.

By far some the BBQ I've had here on the East Coast. ?I like everything about the place. The ambiance is fun and doesn't take itself seriously with the glass jugs in lieu of pitchers, the knives on the taps, the looped video of a fireplace, and benches complete with the necessary paper towel rolls. But it's all about the meat, and Fette Sau delivers. ?The pork belly is dangerously good, but after having tried every meat, the briskett takes the cake as my favorite meat there. As for sides, don't leave without trying the baked beans and prepare yourself for a spicy different kind of coleslaw. ?Good, but not amazing. ?The potato salad was also a bit too refridgerated for my taste. The one knock on the place is that none of the sauces are knock-your-socks off delicious. ?The sweet sauce is the best by far. ? Still, delicious bbq all the way.

Other than the somewhat stressful seating situation, this place is awesome. I haven't had better BBQ in New York. I would go so far as to say this isn't just good bbq "for New York," but just plain good bbq. There are vegetarian side options, which I really like, but are definitely not enough for your vegetarian friend to be satisfied with his/her meal -- not the best place to bring that friend. The mac & cheese is GREAT, though. The meat is all really good, but the pork belly and the brisket are my favorites. I like sitting at the bar, there is one woman who works behind the bar who is particularly laid back and cool. They have a great beer and whiskey selection, and while the place is really relaxed, you don't want to linger too long when there are lines of people angling to take your spot at a table. The tables are communal, so if you're super anti-social, this isn't the place for you.

I am a huge Brooklyn fan..haven' t lived there in quite a while but I always have been and always will be...from Brooklyn! ?I am also a huge bbq fan..the good slow cooked well seasoned meats. ?I want some pull on the ribs - don't want them falling off the bone and ?the brisket should have ?a solid smoky flavor and a well balanced rub. ?So almost as exciting as attending an old fashioned double header at Ebbets field (Ok - I was not around for those but would love to have been), the super combo of great BBQ in Brooklyn requires this Flatbush boy to holler "Frickin A". I love the decor..very Brooklyn. ?Its a converted garage tucked in the middle of the block. ?The tap handles...consisting of butcher knives and cleavers - certainly brings to mind some great gang fights of 50s and 60s. The meat, sold by the pound and served on a huge tray, is first rate. ?Right up there with Dinosaur and Hill Country as the best the City has to offer. ? While I have heard great things about the bbq'd pastrami (talk about a real Brooklyn combo!) but have not tried it yet. ?They have not had it every time I have been in there.

We got here around 9:30pm on a Friday night. The line was by the door and nary an empty seat in the house. I don't remember how long the wait was but it wasn't excruciating. We got tons of ribs, a quarter lb of brisket, a quarter lb of pork shoulder, cole slaw, pickles, and a key lime tart. The buns are a waste of carbs. Big bottle of bbq sauce is awesome. Overall, the place was finger lickin' good and it's comforting to know that there are so many fellow meatlovers in the area - I know too many vegetarians/non-chicken meathaters. It's good to come with people - line for meat, line for drinks, and someone to save seats. Also, be forewarned that by the time you leave, you'll be marinated in the scent of smoky bbq. Way more subtle than at a Korean bbq where the smoke is blowing in your face.

Rarely do i venture to Brooklyn but a friend's birthday prompted me to this little trek. It's set up like a gleaming butcher shop with beer flowing out of various meat hacking utensils. Genius. The tables are communal and there is everything from a big TV screen to communal tables to a cozy fire place and an outdoor area. Accommodating to all sorts of restaurant needs, minus vegetarianism. There are no plates and your food gets dumped on big metal trays lined with wax paper. It's a carnivore and flavor lover paradise. Their chili is very hearty (a little heavy on salt) and their meat is seasoned well. It's a perfect man's (and woman) land and great for a group gathering.

Fette Sau is for people who have never left NYC for BBQ. It does have a real good thing going though. I showed up with 2 other friends at 6pm on a Sunday evening. The line up was starting but it wasn't too bad, maybe 10 deep. The 3 of us decided ahead of time we were going to split a half pound of the following: Beef Brisket, Pulled Pork, Chicken and Sausage links with a side of Pickles, Slaw and Beans. We arrived to the scale/ordering counter and placed. The guy behind the counter commented on my friend's Antidote shirt and shot the shit for a bit about that pricey 7". Already off to an awesome start. We paid for everything and it came around to 55 bucks which is pretty great for the amount of work and hours it takes to make all this food. We sat down and ordered some beers at the beer/liquor bar (FYI: you have to pay for your food and drinks separately) and sat down. The brisket was real good and the pulled pork was sorta dry and whatever (I've made better) The roasted chicken (included head and foot) was decent but nothing to write home about. The links were pretty tasty, very fresh. As for the sides, the beans are a must, lots of flavour. ?Pickles were very yum, but I dig garlic flavour more than the half sour they offer. The slaw was kinda weird, it was almost an asian type of slaw with big hunks of veggies and sort of a sesame vinaigrette. I highly recommend checking out this place if you're a BBQ foodie like myself, however I don't think I would make a point to come back and go again. This place making the Top list of BBQ on Bon Appetite gave way too much hype for how little flavour I've had elsewhere (Re: Franklin's in Austin, TX). But like I said, it's a good thing NYC has a place like this.

I'm giving this five stars because 4 stars is too low, and there's no 4.5 star option (seriously, when are they going to implement that? iTunes, too! FIve options for judging quality is hardly enough!). I say this because a five star meal is possible here. You are not guaranteed one, but when it all comes together, it's awesome. Yes, the sides kind of suck. But the sides are hardly the point, are they? Unless you're a vegetarian, in which case, you should not be at a BBQ place. Only the beans are worth getting, and that mostly to eat the pork floating in it. But the meat..oh, the meat. When they are on, they are on. The guy who has been serving every single time I've gone there is patient, will help out in ordering the right amount of meat for you, and doesn't give you any pressure (you might feel pressured by the long line of people behind you, but that's your own fault). The pork belly, when they have it, is the best. So fatty that you really shouldn't eat more than a quarter pound but soooo good. The beef ribs that I've had a couple of times weren't as good, occasionally coming out pretty dry. The sausage, however, is pretty good if you're a sausage type person. Other than that, the pulled pork/pork shoulder/brisket/etc are usually pretty good bets. You're not guaranteed for every bit of meat you get to be perfect, but, as I keep repeating, when it works, you're going to want to eat it for the rest of the evening. The beer is good, served in jugs, but the other awesome thing is the bourbon bar. The large portly bartender there is great--if you have no idea what you want in a bourbon, he knows just how to walk you through the process of picking one out. If you get it on the rocks, they use special large ice cubes of distilled water that won't melt as fast and water down your drink too quickly. Really, I love this place.

BBQ meat heaven. ?Loved every second of gorging. ?GORGING on MEAT, beans, and pickles. ? My favourite was the duck breast - a tad pricey at 24 / lb but yummy. ?Loved the bbq sauces. Saturday night was a bit crowded but the concept was great. ?Line up order your meat by weight and then you were off to the picnic benches.

I know, I know... going to bbq spot on July 4th and I couldn't find a bbq party to get free bbq?? Well! This was the perfect time to go, not ubber crowded and damn good bbq! We shared some pork sausage, pork belly and the brisket. Goodness all around! I'm very persnickety about brisket (part of my childhood in west Texas just made me that way =P) but this was good compared to the limited choices in NYC. ?Side of pickles helped to cut through the fatty goodness and the BBQ sauces were decent. Gallon of Coney Island lager made the mood more festive. All in all, highly recommended if you can find a spot amongst the communal tables.

I want to give this place one less star for making me fat the summer they opened, but I would feel like I was betraying my allegiance to some of the finest BBQ I've ever tasted....

This definitely lives up to the hype. We had the Brisket, its cut nice and thick. Great thick layer of smoky crusty seasoning, moist inside, and just the right amount of fat. Guss pickles are a fun treat, but at 1.50 for 2, I can't justify getting more than 1 each person. The booze selection is also fun. Growlers and double-growlers are available, as well as sample size beers (half pint). The line kinda sucks. The line is ?slow not because the place is so crowded, but because the servers move super duper slow. I guess its a hipster thing that I wouldn't understand.

Easily one of the top three BBQ joints in the whole city. The meats are all smoked to perfection. You can see the incredible 1 inch smoke ring in anything you eat. The smell of the place as you walk in, should be bottled. The ribs, pork belly, links, brisket and if they have any steak are the best bets. The sides are pretty bad. Wish they had some good slaw. But i do not go get BBQ for the sides. Get some beans and a few rolls and you are good to go. Don't forget to get a half gallon of some tasty booze...

Fette Sau is some fatty pig goodness! Love the brisket and pork belly, the fattiest ones of course. My favorite sides are the collard greens and brussel sprouts, both have tons of meat in them too! The bar has the coolest taps I've ever seen and one of the most extensive bourbon collections in the NYC area. They have their own beer made for them by Sixpoints brewery, really tasty. It I would highly recommend going there earlier in the week when it's not so insanely packed. It gets crazy busy on the weekend. Three cheers to the 3 B's; BBQ, Bourbon & Beer!!!

Fette Sau is the best place to get barbeque north of the Mason-Dixon. You wait on line to get food cafeteria style, know what you want and yell it out. ?Don't forget the sides, the broccoli is out of this world. ?If you want your cardiologist to get a new pool try the pork belly, it is amazing but you will hate yourself when you are done. There are taps of beer with different cleavers, it makes you think Sweeney Todd decorated the place. The only draw back is the tables. ?You have to fight for a seat, which are picnic tables, many people don't want to share. ?Make sure one person gets the food while the others get the seats. ?Cell phones makes good walky talkies. ? Once you get a seat enjoy the outdoors and of course the food.

Fette Sau, Fette Sau, delicious pigs and cow(s)! This place made me so deliriously happy I could sing made -up songs about it all day. When I walked in and the smoky BBQ smell entered my nose, my mouth watered so hard it hurt. I also immediately loved the decor. Hipsters sat cheek-to-cheek on three long benches; it was a miracle that we ever got a spot. Daniel K is certainly right about the auto body feel, but since I don't know anything about Dr. Quinn's restaurant, I'm going to compare it to a crowded version of the Boneshack from Grindhouse: Planet Terror. It all fit together naturally, without the forced feel of most themed restaurants. And they didn't leave one meat-themed detail out; the coat hangers are plastic covered meat hooks, the walls are littered with faint sketchings of beef, pork and lamb charts, and the beer taps are cleavers and knives. But enough about the violent yet intoxicating imagery. You order your meat from the counter BY THE POUND... my kinda place. Here's what they had the other night: - Pork Belly. You think you shouldn't love it, but you do. You're eating straight up fat, you can't hide that fact. But it melts in your mouth with the essence of the best bacon you've ever had in your life. Your head will tell you no, and your insides will start to tell you no, but your mouth will continue to say yes. - Beef ribs -- They ran out RIGHT before we reached the counter, it was very sad, I'll have to come back another night for these. - Pulled pork shoulder -- mouth wateringly good, definitely not dry, even better with the many unlabeled sauces on the table. - Beef brisket -- smoky and perfect. - Sausage links -- no complaints here. Again, really good with the sauces. Pork ribs -- Not my favorite, but still very yummy. The pickles were also amazing (I got a second order to go) and the baked beans were very good, some bits of meat found their way into them but that's OK with me. My only complaints: One, this place is wayy too crowded, even after 8 on a Sunday; and two, the staff is indeed surly! You would think I was the worst person in the world for ordering a soda instead of a beer... or maybe she just didn't like my face?

It was German for "fat Swine"??!!? I thought 'Fette Sau' meant "The fat cow" in French!! The food is definitely good here. My friend stuck with the best parts Fette Sau had to offer, so everything tasted great. The sausage was extremely fresh and the pastrami was very very juicy (we asked for the fattiest part LOL). The rolls and the sauerkraut were off. Don't get them. The meal was really really great, but as soon as I saw the bill I thought to myself "looks like I'll be coming here once in a month, at max" Although not as flavorful as Fette Sau, I could get a plate of Argentine Parrillada (La Esquina Criolla @ Corona ave) for around $15 in queens with just as much sausage and meat. Also I would suggest you visit Manna's Soul Food in Harlem for a similar experience as they charge you by the pound (meats were $8 something per pound when I went there). But the food quality of Fette Sau was definitely worth the visit. They were one of the freshest parts of meat I've ever tasted since I began Yelping. No lie!!! Also I loved the fact that they serve the beer in a jelly jar. LOL!!! 5 stars for food quality - 1 star for price = 4 stars Thx to JTZ for recommending me this place.

Now, this is my kind of place! Tucked inside a little alleyway. It's the kind of place where people come knowing what they are looking for. A bunch of picnic tables and benches. It's the kind of place that are like home away from homes. Everyone felt like family because they were so friendly. The food was amazing. Excellent bbq selection. It is a bit pricey but well worth it. Check the blackboard for specials, once they run out they will erase it and have something else to replace it. I love the revolving menu. Fette Sau is unique and a really chill place to come during a warm day. They have outdoor and indoor seating and plenty of beers on tap

WOW! When I picture Brooklyn BBQ in my head, i see a no frills joint, and that's exactly what Fette Sau is. Converted from an old garage into an amazing BBQ joint, this place is not to be missed. I had a sampling of everything from the pork belly, to the sausage to the pulled pork and some ribs. ALL AMAZING! What really surprised me were the baked beans. I hate baked beans, and let me stress, hate. However the baked beans at Fette Sau looked a bit more like Chili so I decided to give them a whirl. Outcome? I went back for more! The only con is that it tends to be crowded alll the time. So go prepared to wait a bit for a seat. Did I mention the seating is a picnic tables? Does it get much more Brooklyn? Love it!

Brisket = awesome. Pulled pork shoulder = awesome Pork belly = awesome Burnt end baked beans = awesome The food at Fette Sau is fantastic, but the wait to get the food & finding seating is not so fantastic. You order food by the pound at Fette Sau, and if you've ever been to a barbecue place like this, you often order too much or too little. The guy behind the counter recommended just the right amount of food to cover two people -- about a1/3 of a pound of three meats plus a side. It was spot on, and I would wager that it would be satisfactory for most people. Fette Sau also has a great beer selection to wash down all the grub.

BBQ! ?BBQ in WBerg! ? A novel concept. ?We definitely need more down-home southern-style cuisine in NY. ?This place is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Very simple concept. ?No table service. ?You go up to where they keep the meat, you tell them which meats you require, and how much. ?You pay by the pound, and bring your personalized tray of meats and sides to any number of communal picnic tables, both indoor and outdoor. The bar is amazing. ?Beer is sold by the half pint, pint, quart, half-gallon, or gallon. ?The pulls on the taps are the best I've ever seen - various meat cleavers and tenderizers and various implements. ?So creative. The BBQ is delicious. ?The atmosphere is crowded, bustling and happy. ?Nothing much bad I can really say, except, don't expect to get your own table, or even any privacy at all. ?But right now I am full of beer and meat and happy.

Fette Sau means "fat pig" in German, which is really all too fitting for how I felt when I left. ?But, at least I was feeling fat AND happy (like a pig in slop, you might even say). ? Anyway, ?after entering the paved yard full of long picnic tables packed with grease-moistened diners feasting on tin trays of meat, we stood awkwardly trying to decide the protocol- seat ourselves? serve ourselves? ?Finally, we figged it out and realized you must go through the yard to the inside, where you stand in line at the meat counter for food and separately at the bar for beer/whiskey. The seating is first come first serve, which can be tricky. ? You order the meat by the pound, the way I LIKE it. ?The pastrami was melt-in-your-mouth good. ?So was the pulled pork, which I stuffed into the hot rolls they throw onto your tray for good measure to make little mini-porko sammies. ?I recommend slathering it in one of the savory sauces that are in giant squeeze bottles on the tables. ?I have to ?agree with others about the sides...I def regretted our choice of potato salad and baked beans. ?I was really lusting for the pickles, but hey, next time. The beers were DELICIOUS! Thanks again, Germans! As a discriminating Nashvillian BBQ eater, I give this VERY high marks. ?The atmosphere was fun, the meat was flavorful (and not too expensive), and the drinks make you drunk. ?Just get some mac and cheese and slaw, for the love of god! You can even make it fancy, but please just make it. UPDATE: The pickles and the sauerkraut are both delicious and great ways to cut the richness of the meat with some acidity. I recommend getting one or the other.

The Ribs here are totally 5 star. But everything else is sorta lacking. Pulled Pork is super duper dry and doesn't have the best flavor. Sides are insanely expensive, can you believe it's possible to pay 8 bucks for a side of spicy broccoli? Well it is... This place suffers most from the mega 'tude of the employees who treat you as if you are LUCKY to be there. I guess I'm lucky to blow 40 bucks on some ribs and beer but I thought I was more of a sucker... It's one of those places I don't really want to support because the people working there/owners are such jackasses. They never comp a drink if you buy 10 in a row. They never smile. It's like a nightmare summer camp cafeteria getting your food, with the mean fat ugly tattooed lunch lady sneering at you... Anyhow, you get the picture. The BEST time to go here is in the summer, at around 5pm for an early dinner. No crowds, you can be in and out of the interior area and sit outside in the sun and enjoy the Ribs...

My wife and I are split on this place. We are both from TN and while that doesn't make us authorities, it does mean we've had a lot of experience standing in line with a tray to get a roll, baked beans, potato salad, and beer in a jar. When it comes to BBQ I tend to lean towards the Carolinas and she towards Memphis. My wife was turned off by the food our first time. I myself was ambivalent. But here is the silver lining, BOURBON, WHISKEY, RYE! It's a nice, serious selection. That's why I keep coming back (without my wife). And maybe it's the alcohol I consume there, but things taste a little better every time I go. Almost all of my ?friends I've taken there since have viewed the experience positively and yes, they are lushes.

This place is amazing, and a real NYC destination. It's a very meta-BBQ experience--there's a 42" HD display with a loop of a fireplace on one wall. An the rest of the atmosphere is also carefully constructed to make you think it was slapped together at the last minute. The designers are geniuses. Lucky for us, the cooks are also geniuses. This is some of the best meat you can get in NYC. It's not cheap, but then you don't need much of it to fill you up. I enjoyed the potato salad--it's real potatoes with flavor, not swimming in mayo or something else. The rolls leave something to be desired, but the greatness of the brisket makes everything else worth it. Get there early--one they run out, they run out. They have a note on the wall explaining that the beef is from maine, and the pork is from vermont--all family farms it sounds like. They seem to stop serving at 11pm. One option for dealing with the long lines is the bar--you can grab a beer while you wait. They'll also package your food to go, and you can take it for a picnic, since the communal tables are packed to the gills. There's a bodega on the corner so you can even pick up a six pack on your way to the shady tree. Be sure to ask for the platic forks if you need them.

Maura, congrats on coming back to meat - and what a way to get back into the game. My review might be a bit skewed, as my only time there was on a Thursday after 11pm, but this place is no doubt on point. The brews magically pair well with the 11pm clean-up special ($3 pork sam'iches or brats) and hey guess what, the bbq sauce is pretty tasty. I could have done without the mustachioed hipster quartet, but cheap eats (bonus points for good bbq) and tasty brews always have a soft spot in my heart.

Let's be honest here: getting good BBQ in New York City is basically impossible. ?You can't really get good BBQ until you start getting into the Carolinas, although there may be a few places scattered around Virginia and the District. ?But really, BBQ in NYC is generally a losing proposition. Fette Sau is... well, it's perfectly adequate BBQ for New York. ?The best is, without a doubt, the pork belly. ?That is something to come for, but the rest, eh.

Yay! I'm a fan, indeed. This place is great and I highly recommend it. I came for dinner last Saturday after wanting to try this place for AGES. And I'm so glad I did. Here are two highlights: 1. LOVED the brisket. It is better than Hill Country's, and I'm not really a brisket person, but I could eat this stuff weekly if only it didn't contribute to cholesterol! 2. The pork sausage has fantastic smokiness and flavor. Now, for some low lights, that make me want to knock off a star, or two: 1. the crowd. OMGoodness, this place was packed. Yes, my blood sugar was low and I was probably more grumpy than usual, but there seemed to be SEVERAL tables full of peeps who had long-finished eating and were simply chillin' with their beer. YES, the beer is delicious and great, but PLEASE PEOPLE!! Vacate when you're done eating. There was a massive line of people waiting and many poor souls (myself and my boyfriend included,) were left to eat our meal in the chilly night air, just because some drinkers didn't want to move to the bar? Okay, enough with the rant. 2. Not a fan of the baked beans. I think there might be some extra dark molasses in there. They had a strange after-taste. Will definitely return to Fette Sau as the food is excellent. I just might wait for a quiet weeknight and/or warmer weather.

Love this place! I've managed to beat rush hour times...I've either gotten there right after opening (5pm) or right before closing (11pm). ?Upside to going right when they open is, you have more choices. Sausage links (sweet or spicy) and brisket are my favorite. I'm a pulled pork kinda girl, but its just "ok" for me, love the little potato rolls with it (though some complained they're the cheap sh*t you get at costco). Had ribs from here for the first time the other night and I can't complain. They were good, I've had better. Get there early for more choices of both meats & sides and skip the crowds. Or get there later for slightly fewer choices of meats..only sides left was the potato salad (which I can do without, but always manage to end up getting) but it wasn't crowded either.

Long lines on the weekends. Been here twice, waited an hour at 9pm on Saturday and about 20 minutes at 5pm on another Saturday. I'll be back on a weekday and will report back on the line then. Lines aside, the food is awesome. The beans are ridiculously good. That's the only side I need...other than the roll. I'm a big fan of the fatty brisket. The pork chop is great as well if you're looking for something that at least looks healthier. It's hard not to come here more often since it's so close but I don't want to end up on The Biggest Loser so I spread out my visits. Still worth it though.

Location is odd, in between a deli and empty space. However, seeing that neon pink piggy out front made me realized I am in for a treat. The line is extremely long yet the space is very biergarden yet friendly. Going here with a group of friends is extremely recommended. You will get a greater experience doing so. The meat is simply delish!! Beer choices are good. (love the knife handles for each beer on draft). The side on the other hand no bueno. Simply go for the meat! Just thinking about is making my mouth water...yum..... I wanna go now.

OK so it's Bo southern BBQ but it is by far the most superior we have in NYC. Go here and grab a qtr lbs of anything! ?It won't disappoint. ?Stars are the pork belly and the spicy sausages. The sauce is great too. ?Next grab yourself a growler of Liquid Gold and load up some meat on one of the delicious potato buns and you're in business! For a nice after dinner treat head across the street to Spuyten Duyvil (by the same owners) for some great mulled wine in the winter or a great micro brew when it's hot. ?They have a really cool little beer garden in the back!

If you don't think this is the best BBQ in New York then you're probably a Vegan what doesn't know any better, so scram. ? Go to Fette Sau and buy some meat. ?Eat it and let the juices run down into your beard or chin or whatever. ?Then drink some whiskey. ?Then hope there isn't a line to the bathroom cuz all that alcohol and animal protein is gonna be talking to you in about 23 minutes.

All I need to say is baked beans with pork belly. ? Probably the best bbq I've ever had on the west or east coast. ?The smokiness of the meat is really unique here. ?They also offer different cuts of meat on a day to day basis. ? Also the love the casual ambiance of being in a garage like dark wood room with large benches for your group to sit on. ?They also have a large selection of beers and whiskey served in mason jars.

Casual dining at its best. Service is very cafeteria style. We were there on a weeknight and still had trouble finding seats. Can't imagine how it is during the busy hours. I really wanted the Pork Belly but they were out of it that night. The pulled pork that i settled for came out kinda dry. I had to rely on the BBQ sauce to give it some life. Sampled my fiance's beef brisket and man was it good! Tasty, fatty and moist (words that shouldn't go together). Had to retain myself from finishing it on the spot. Sides were not all that necessary since they give you a piece of cornbread along with your meal. But I've gotta say the baked beans were good. Prices at the bar were on the cheap side. Liked that they had more than beer going on (wine, flavored soda) With the pricing and fat content, this place is not for everyday dining. But overall it wins for being the best BBQ joint in Brooklyn.

Fette Sau is really good for the price and consistent Staff is friendly enough, self seating is annoying (Sometimes very hard to get a seat) Pork and beef ribs are tender and tasty Braised - Pork belly, pork chops, pork sausage, and pork jowls!!!!! (If available these are the fattiest and best prepared) Beef Brisket can be dry, pulled pork will need some BBQ sauce. Choose your own sauce (Great Idea - choose what you like how much of it and how spicy you want it) Sides are OK but this isn't what you come for. Full bar with absinthe menu, drinks are good. Over all a great place for what you get, if you live in the area I suggest take out. You order by the pound and you can get a variety of meat. Focus on the meat here, for the price you can't get better BBQ in NY.

Delicious barbeque, great beer selection. I had pork jowls here last night, and they were amazing. Definitely high-quality stuff, and I like how they rotate through some of the more off-the-run cuts of meat. You can buy beer by the gallon. The downside, as has been alluded to in many other reviews, is the extremely long lines and the awkward seating situation. You'd think they'd want more turnover, so there'd be an impetus to move less slowly at the front counter.

Alright - I have been to Fette Sau twice. ?The first time I went I didn't eat. ?The second time I went, I ate. ?Here's my assessment: Food - Unreal. ?We ordered pulled pork, brisket and sausage. ?It was all moist and delicious, and I think my breasts were noticeably larger when I walked out. ?The beans were also out of this world. ? Atmosphere - Great. ?If you didn't know it is located next to a body shop, you have not done too much research, as that is the first thing that everyone mentions. ?It makes for a dramatic and fun entrance and also provides a nice little foreground to the industrial setting of the restaurant/bar. ?The space is big, open and again industrial. ?It works really well, and there's no way you can go here and not have fun. ?During the summer (or winter, if you choose to act like a man - http://www.youtube.com/w), there are tables outside. ? Scene - I am not very hip, so maybe it's me not exactly fitting into the setting, but I would not go here expecting to meet someone to take home. ?It tends to attract large groups of twenty and thirty somethings, that appear to live in BK (you know what they look like). ? Service - Doesn't really matter. ?You pick up the food on a tray and go sit at a communal table with strangers. ? Drink - As good as the food is and as fun as the space is, the bar might be the best part. ?They have a slew of fancy beers, and they serve them to you in liter and gallon jugs, which you the pour into jars. ?Again, fun. ?They also have a ton of bourbons, which is cool, and a ton of other drinks that people from the south probably enjoy. Go to Fette Sau with a group, eat unhealthy food and drink a ton of beer. ?You won't regret it.

I had heard about Fette Sau from a lot of people when I moved back to Brooklyn, mainly because i live so close to the Smoke Joint & would often use that as a reference point so people could understand where my apt was. ?Everyone kept saying that i HAD to go there. ?I finally made a visit this past Friday after work for dinner & drinks...and I assure you that a return trip is on the docket. Love the atmosphere, the food, the picnic tables, the beers, the beer glasses (jugs, Ball jars, etc), the fireplace on a flat screen, and...oh yeah...the food. Of the BBQ places I have been to since I've been back in NYC, this ranks only behind Hill Country. ? A quick round-up of what we sampled... 1 lb of ribs - yummy, but not spectacular 1 lb beef brisket - sliced thick & a bit chewier than I hoped for, but still good 1/2 lb of pork shoulder - great w a lil extra sauce 1/2 lb of beef cheek - fatty goodness 3 sausages - awesome baked beans - a bit too smoky for me pickles - perfectly sour dinner rolls - yummy & sweet This rating is 3 (wish I could do 3.5) for the food + 1 for everything else. ?Bottom line, it's just a cool, fun place to eat & drink...and nice & close to the G!

Some BBQ is all about some secret sauce handed down generation from generation. ?Fette Sau is all about the meat, and you order it by the pound. ?In fact there isn't even any sauce; not on the meat, nor on the side of the meat, nor even on the tables. ?Instead Fette Sau places the ingredients of a BBQ sauce on the tables, leaving each customer to decide how much mustard, vinegar, ketchup or chili powder they want in their sauce. ?The beans, the brisket and the pork belly are my favorites. The place gets crowded so come early and don't come if you're allergic to hipsters.

One thing I really like about Fette Sau is how clear cut their vision comes through. It's rugged, barbecue and beer with a hipster-appropriate post-appocalyptic atmosphere, like if the end of the world happened, they would still find a way to make a place where men and women can get some meat and grog and this is what it would look like. Four of us tried ?a little of everything; ham, ribs, shoulder, sausage and belly as well as sides of rolls, broccoli and beans. As my meat loving friend who is an incredible chef said "We have to come back here!" I mean...slow cooked, crazy juicy and rubbed with love...like I said, its a clear vision, that comes together in this crazy primal way- sitting at one of a couple long tables, all digging into one tray just piled high with meat... coming just short of eating with your hands (although it wouldn't surprise me to see it). Where else do you get to eat delicious food in that kind of context other than a good ol barbecue spot. One area I can see then working on, only because the meats, sides, beer is so great is dessert. I was a little tips, and craving something sweet and you can never go wrong with peanut butter and chocolate pie, but I feel like they could do better based on the level everything else is on. Pastries aren't the type of thing a pit master specializes in, but like I said, the level everything else is at...it could use a little work. Other than that, wow, Fette Sau...a treat and we'll definately be back.

Ever since I went on a barbecue road trip through the Carolinas, I've been searching desperately for a barbecue fix in NY that can get me that same smokey high. So I had high hopes for Fette Sau when we made the trek out to Brooklyn. Meat here is by the pound and the cost can definitely add up if your eyes are bigger than your stomach. My wife and I started with 1/4 lb of pork belly, 1/2 lb of St. Louis pork ribs, 1/4 lb of beef brisket, a sweet sausage link, and a side of cole slaw. As others have mentioned, the pork belly is ridiculously good; tender and moist and perfect stuffed in a potato roll with a little barbecue sauce. The rest of what we got though was average to ?disappointing. The ribs were decent but not particularly tender. The sweet sausage link was just ok as well. The real disappointment though was the beef brisket which had good flavor but was really dry (surprising given all the positive reviews from other Yelpers). Maybe it was just the day we went. All in all, pretty good barbecue for NY, but I probably won't be hopping on the L train just to come out here for it again. And it definitely won't make you forget about good 'ole southern barbecue.

I heard about Fette Sau from a number of people, so I decided to check it out. It was a chilly February night and as we walked in the door the aroma of smoked meat overwhelmed me (in a good way) The food is served cafeteria style on large metal trays. We (2 of us) tried all of the various meats, and they were delicious but my favorite was the pulled pork. As for sides we decided on beans, pickles, and sauerkraut. I thoroughly enjoyed the beans as they were a little sweet and spicy. The one negative about the night were the tapped out kegs. We tried to buy 2 different beers and they were all done; we had to settle on a different choice. Also, your clothes, hair, skin, etc. absorb the smokey scent of Fette Sau, so it's a good idea to wash everything after.

This place rocked my BBQ world. On top of great pork chops and sausage you can order a Gallon of beer! It's everything you ever wanted in a good BBQ joint. It has the feeling of being in a friends back yard. The seating is all communal with picnic tables. If your not sure what to do when you walk in, just get in line and ask the dude behind the counter to fix up a kick ass plat! You will be glad you did.

After seeing this place pop up on "Hot on Yelp" for the past few weeks, decided to stop by to see what the fuss was all about. The aroma of pork, pork, and more pork welcomes you when you enter this place. Always a good sign. Got some of the brisket, pork sparerib, and pork shoulder to go. Definitely greasy (err...juicy) and flavorful. I like that food is priced by weight, though it was a bit inefficient that there's only one scale per long line. Wish there were more sauce options, but the one offered was tasty with just the right amount of spice. Loved the bread. It was soft and reminded me of Hawaiian bread without the sweetness.

In the city, it's not uncommon that a hipster, rustic, communal table place would be packed and no doubt was this place busy at 6 pm on a Sunday summer evening. This spot is sandwiched between a barbwire enclosed lot (probably for car parts, etc) and a residential apartment building with a first floor bodega. Tonight, the waiting line essentially poured out onto the sidewalk; from the uncovered driveway-like outdoor area all the way to the back of the covered eating communal canteen room. While the wait was long, it wasn't too bad because the weather was temperate, drinks could be ordered separately from the bar while waiting and a water cooler with neatly stacked plastic cups were easily accessible for everyone (no charge). After an hour or so, we finally reached the front of the line and feasted our eyes on the yummies. Pork spare ribs, meatloaf, beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork sausages, and pulled pork...all stacked up on top of each other. It was meat heaven! The menu also had sides, we only picked up a couple of them so as to have more room for the meat...but they did have some good baked beans, cold broccoli salad, sauerkraut, pickles, two types of packaged chips, potato mash, and some other typical bbq sides. The dessert was some sort of local creamery's ice cream and a keylime tart. Anyway, between me and my buddy, we had 3/4 lb of beef brisket (medium-fatty/lean), 2 beef short ribs (approx 1.5-2 lbs but very soft, juicy, & fatty), 5 pork spare ribs (fatty & tender), 1 pork sausage (tasty & robust flavors, but not a fan of sausages in general), a side of sauer kraut, broccoli salad and baked beans. Total bill for the food came up to $79.50. My friend, who's a guy btw, said he was stuffed to the brim by mid-end of dinner and I was definitely comfortably full (though I eat a lot for a small girl) Next time (because there will def. be a next time), if I'm ordering for myself only, I'd get a single beef short rib, 1/4 lb of brisket and depending on how hungry I am, 1-2 pork spare ribs. That way, I could also enjoy some pickles & beans on the side AND some dessert.

This place is nothing special, unless you think it's special to wait 30 minutes on a line for mediocre bbq. So we waited 30 minutes on a line. I ordered 1 lb of St. Louis style pork ribs and a pound of beef brisket. Although everything was fresh, the cuts of meat were very fatty. I could hardly taste any meat in the brisket because it was 50% fat. This was not very pleasing to my palate. I know what good brisket is- this was mediocre at best. The seasoning was the only redeeming quality of this dinner. The St. Lou style ribs were only slightly better, but it was still a fatty cut. I would be ok with this, if the price reflected the quality, but it did not. This place is pretty pricey...ahem.. 52 bucks later. My favorite item was the coleslaw. It was fresh, crunchy, and flavorful, but my girlfriend disagreed with me on this, so you'll have to use your judgment. Skip the baked beans unless you're in the mood for undercooked food. It's a cute place for a date perhaps, but I wouldn't go back.

Divine. Pork lovers, you have to go to this place. The meat is all out there, in front of your eyes, displayed for your pleasure. Anthony Bourdain should probably shoot a "Food Porn" episode here.

In many ways this is like getting prison food. You stand in a long line waiting to get your tray, you point at the food you like to have and they through it directly on the tray - you pay by the weight. BUT - the food is great. We had the pulled pork shoulder, brisket and sirloin and this was some of the best BBQ I've had. You then find a vacant spot at one of the long tables and pour various BBQ sauces over the meat and you share this. Great concept, very low key, good beer and cool decor. Remember to wear clothes for outdoor as you will spend the majority of your time waiting in line outside. But it's worth the wait. The line is a bit annoying especially that once you bought the food you will have to do a new line for the beer.

Consistently delish BBQ. DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU WANT SAUCE! If you want wonderfully smoked meats, you will go to Fette Sau. This isn't your run of the mill sauce slathered BBQ. There is love in each and every thing they serve. My fave items are....brisket and pulled pork. The smoked peking duck was a nice change a few weeks ago. All the need is the cole slaw, pickles, rolls and some beer and you are set. I took off one star for the crowds that hover during peak hours for a prime spot to sit down. My suggestion is to just go early (5ish) and just hang out. ENJOY!

YES. Delicious barbecue until it runs out. The best damned cider I've ever tasted on tap, with an awesome rotating selection of microbrews. In some big ass containers. Big. The whiskey selection (they have ryes!) is phenomenal. The hang is great - but avoid the joint on Friday and Saturdays, it's simply overrun.

A great BBQ Joint. It was loud. Service (at the counter) was slow. But the meats were wonderful. We hung around for about two and a half hours drinking beer and eating some great BBQ. Definitely stake out a table while someone gets food. Our group of 6 waited about 30 minutes to get seats. We ordered about three and a half pounds of meat with 3 large sides for six people and it wasn't a ton of food. So plan on getting a little more meat depending on how hungry you are. Also skip the rolls they are store brought. Ribs were fall off the bone tender but could have more meat on them. Links were good and so were the boneless beef ribs. The best meat was the brisket, so thick and tender! Oh pork belly was awesome; the fat was so rich and delicious. It's artery clogging good.

3 stars because whether you can get fed is always a toss up. 5 for food... average of 4. This place isn't big enough to hold the demand, but if it were the atmosphere wouldn't be as kick ass. ?It is pretty damn cozy with the wooden benches, tv burning log, lit phonographs hanging from ceiling over bar, etc.. ?The number of ways are endless. The meat is always delicious - generally I get the brisket or pulled pork. ?The burnt ends baked beans are good, but sweet. Cora's broccoli salad is good if you like spicy, vinegary things. The booze are good. Great bourbon list & beer list. Beer comes in jars! You can get 1/2 pint, pint, quart...etc... Also, they have the cutest business card ever near the counter.

DELICIOUS. Just yummy. If you love meat, this is the place to be. I highly recommend the espresso-rubbed ribs. I could cut it with my spoon. The angus brisket was just like a nice piece of prime steak. The spicy pork sausage tasted like chorizo from Argentina. They offer bbq and spicy bbq sauce, but you really don't need it for the ribs. I topped off my meal with a blondie and fresh pickles. The bar has cutlery tools in place of beer knobs. I will def be back! MMMmmm.

BBQ right in the heart of Wburg? ?Sounds promising, right? You can actually look at this place from several sides. ? On one hand, it seems like a fun place with picnic benches, beer sizes including a gallon, pint, and half pint, and piles of meat. ? But from my objective view, this place is outrageously expensive for what you get. ?As in previous BBQ reviews, I demand perfection in meat when it comes to BBQ, as well as kickass sauces, and decent options for sides are always a bonus. ?This place is below average on all of these points. ?At least 2 of their 3 sauces are basically mustard (gross, to me). ?Sides are basically only slaw and beans. ?No fries or onion rings will be found here. ?If you happen to end up here, i do recommend trying the corn bread (has jalapeno). There is also no host or service, and you will have to fight to get a table. To get to the point, I got ordered around a pound of meat, a piece of cornbread, and a pint of beer; basically to feed one and a half people, and it came to $45. ?For the price, you can definitely find a nicer place.

I went here with a buddy of mine about two weeks ago and we got parking right near the entrance and the first thing you see is a pink neon sign that says "Fette Sau" and for those of you who don't know German (my friend had to tell me) it means Fat Pig!!! So we get out of the car as we approach the entrance we see picnic tables that are all full and a line of people to the entrance. Lucky for us we were meeting some people there who were basically at the front of the line and had already saved us seats. The place is just really cool looking, very comforting, you just know your gonna get great food ?here. On to the food...First off you have to order the meat by the pound and we had no problem doing so lol. ?We ordered ?pulled pork, sausage, brisket and ribs. For sides we ordered the broccoli, potatoes and pickles and beans. I didn't get to try the beans but I heard they were the best out of the sides, pickles and broccoli were ok and I thought the potatoes would be really good but epic fail. Overall stick to the meat, I wouldn't waste the stomach room or money on the sides. ? ? On to the meat... I don't eat beef so i can't comment on the brisket but my friends devoured it, it was the first to go. For the ribs, too bad they didn't taste as amazing as they looked, I've had better. The sausage was good but the only reason I give this place 4 stars is because of the pulled pork. As much as the potatoes were an epic fail the pulled pork was an epic success and the BBQ sauce that they have AMAZING. (they have two the regular i guess and one that is really spicy, I'm all for spicy but the regular is just perfect) I pretty much devoured the pulled pork my self and I had just stuffed my face at a bbq that was catered just prior to coming here and if I hadn't i could of easily eaten like 2 more pounds of it. I would definitely come here again but solely for the pulled pork and that bbq sauce!!! Also they have a full bar and they make some of their own beers and cider. I had tried the cider and liked.

I hate to say it, but I think this place is hyped up too much. I've been wanting to try this place out after i saw it on TV. Unfortunately for Fette Sau, i had really high expectations. I mean it was good, but it wasn't banging. On a Saturday afternoon 12:30PM, my friends and I trekked into Brooklyn using the L train. THe commute to Fette Sau isn't bad at all if you're coming in from Manhattan. My 2 friends and I shared a 1/2 lb. of brisket, 1/2 lb. of pulled pork shoulder, 1/2 lb. of sliced pork belly, 3 rolls, and a large side of roasted potatoes with bacon. The brisket was in my opinion very dry. The rub on it was flavorful, but i couldn't get past on how dry it was. It seriously pales in comparison to Hill Country's moist brisket. I'd have to say it was more flavorful than Hill Country's Lean brisket, but i think it was also more dry. ? The pork shoulder was also very dry. My friends and I had to douse it with sauces to keep it moist. I was not a fan of this. The pork belly. Now WOW talk about being moist. This made up for all of the dryness of the other two meats. The pork belly was so fatty, there was like no pork meat. It was like 90% pork fat. It was soooo goood. Omg it melted in my mouth. I loved it. The roll was average; it was just nice to use it to make a mini sandwich. The best part of the lunch meal was our side dish. The roasted potatoes with the bacon..OMG it was THE BOMB. One of the best potato side dishes that i ever tasted. I could have had this by itself and i would have been content. It was that good. Overall i was disappointed in the pork shoulder and brisket, but the belly and potatoes made up for it. I was disappointed that wagyu cheeks and pork cheeks weren't on the menu like it states on the website. I also think the subpar brisket and shoulder is due to the fact that the food was for lunch. I'm hoping it will be better for dinner time. I will need to give this place a second chance some day.

Most inhospitable establishment I've ever been to. People lurking and claiming seats like wild dogs and vultures when they haven't even ordered food yet!! ?It's the WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD (that is if you could even call it a "restaurant").

As much as I love to eat like a vegan, sometimes you just need to go Gonzo. Fette Sau is just that. It's the best BBQ I've ever had - anywhere. You order you meat by the pound depending on what they have today. It's a great place to go with friends, and try a few things, plus there are a whole mess of sauces to choose from at the bench-style tables. Top it all off with a GIANT jug of kick - ass beer on tap. Meat lovers delight.

I don't really know where to begin...meat by the pound, 1/2 pound...whatever...they throw it on a scale and you take as much as you like. ?Prices are very reasonable. The brisket is some of the best I have had, and I've traveled quite a bit for BBQ (read Austin, TX: Stubb's, County Line, etc.) Pulled pork and pork belly are up there as well...as mentioned in a quick tip, leaves the ribs for Fatty 'Cue, they do a much better job with them. Last, but certainly not least (at least in my book) is a terrific bourbon selection. PS - get there early, they were jammin' by 7pm and I was there on a Tuesday.

Tables are communal style so its pretty fun trying to squeeze a seat in this place. it was crowded too! I love the fact you can buy your beer from a gallon jug and share amongst your friends. yep that's right I said a gallon!

This place is a no frills BBQ with good beer. It's a down to earth place. I would have easily walked passed it if I didn't look out for it. Just as easily I walked passed the milk bar near there. I went with a couple of friends and we housed 1 pound of beef and pork ribs, 1 pound of brisket and a quarter pound of pork belly. We had to watch our girlish figure :) We ordered the sausage as well. Thankfully, the guy forgot to weigh it and give it to us. We also had the burnt end beans and cole slaw but they were not that good. Included is also potato rolls. I should have asked for more but we were stuffed. We ordered the right amount of food. Overall, the meat is well done. The sides are eh. The total was 120 for the 3 of us. Pretty pricey but that because of the sides and half a gallon of beer.. I want to go back on Hog Thursday.

Don't tell my southern relatives, but this que was some of the best I've ever had. Speaking of queue, you will most likely stand in one for this stuff. There was a gentleman in line beside us who voiced his frustration with the ordeal of ordering which I'm inclined to agree with. ?I would have given it the full five stars otherwise. Was it worth it? Yes. Do I have to be in the right mood to deal with it? Yes. I'm going to take another yelper's advice and try to hit this place on a downswing. ?If you come prepared to wait, you won't be disappointed.

Went on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too busy (til my Crossfit crew showed up). Solid spot. Pork belly is a must. Pulled pork was on the dry side and not too memorable. Ribs were flavorful and smoky. Beans were surprisingly great and the cole slaw had a nice summery freshness to them.

Why did I have to eat shortly before discovering this place on my last night in town?!?!?!?!?! My nose led me to this barbeque joint while walking to some bar down the street. My friend and I walked in just to breath in the wonderful scent of smoky barbeque'd goodness. ?Luckily, we're fast walkers, so we had a long moment to take in all that we could before the rest of our group caught up to us. ?What I did notice in my brief visit were lots of hipsters crammed into a small garage type with saucy fingers, huge gallon-sized jugs filled with beer, and quite a extensive whiskey selection. ?I just knew I would be returning before the night was over. So i get to the bar, and am having a great time with my friends and with the new people I met, but the whole time I was there all I could think of was ditching these people so that I can return to the Fette Sau before they closed. ?Does that make me a bad person? ?If so, then I don't want to be good... ? Upon returning, ?it was near closing time. ?I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and a jar of beer. ?Both were pretty darn tasty, ?I only wish I were able to go earlier to taste the full menu. ?But for what I did experience, I was rather impressed. ?And trust me, I know barbeque. ?I do see a return visit to this fine establishment in my near future. ?I will update with all the juicy details soon!

Alright, lets see here, where to start. I went for lunch with a pal after he decided he didn't want to eat at Saltie. ?After eating our meal we decided that we should've just stuck with Saltie. Anywho let me further describe my thought process. The way things are ordered is weird, but fine, I can manage. My pal, Petey, and I got two meats, Pork Belly and Brisket. As a swineatarian, I like when I eat pork to have it be EXTRA delicious. This was not the case. The pork belly was dry, it needed to have some side of sauce on it to swallow it down. Depressing. The brisket was fatty, but juicy and delicious, unfortunately my swineatarian diet does not allow me to consume meat besides pork, so I was left at a sample and the opinion of Petey. We also got two sides, potato salad and baked beans. Potato salad- blah. Baked beans, not what I thought they would be, no sweet, no smokey, just fatty and vinegar like. I also saw them pour a whole tray of grease into them (aka, I thought they'd be 40 times more delicious) but they were bad. I didn't eat them, even. The complaints of the people next to me were the pickles were too hard and the broccoli was too large. I have big ears, I listen in. The best part about the meal was that THE FONZ was there. I'd save your $30 and go buy anything else. It was a such a let down. :(

Off the chain. The line was long, but well worth it. And the seats, we were fighting. The food, grilled and BBQed to perfection.. I had brisket, steak, pulled pork and chicken.. about 8lbs of food for the 10 of us. Not your ordinary BBQ meat spot..

Really good bbq place, I have come here a couple of times and tried a lot of their food. The sides, Hill country beats them in this category. Fette saus broccoli and cole slaw and pickles were nothing special. The broccoli was cold and not too flavorful, and did not fare well with the meat. But again, I don't care for the sides. The people I go to eat with always cry that they want to get sides, so I suffer because of them. I would rather spend all of my hard earned money on the meat! (no homo) The BBQ ribs, brisket, pulled pork, lamb breast is fantastic. In my opinion, much better then hill country. The meat is more tender and less greasy and prices are about the same. The ribs are very tender and have a ton of flavor. The reason I give this place five stars though, despite it being a bit pricey, is for their meat and also for their sauce. I LOVE their BBQ and hot sauce. They are tangy and delicious, hot but not too hot, and sweet and savory but not over the top. I also like the bread they provide better then hill country. My friend told me their bar is pretty great too, but I have not been there yet.

Knock your socks off BBQ. Pros: THE MEAT!, great selection of craft beers and whiskey, knowledgeable staff, great location. Cons: a long wait if you do not arrive early, side dishes that simply don't rank next to the meat. Excellent BBQ, I cannot get enough. Standouts are the boneless beef rib, lamb ribs, pork sausage...well...everything is quite good. The brisket is good, but prepare for a strip of fat down the middle. Prepare for a line and less-than-ideal seating should you arrive after 6pm and before 9:45pm. For those who have never tried, expect to spend a lot - budgeting your meal by weight (1/4 lb. of brisket, 1/2 lb. of beef ribs) is inaccurate at best. Great food, but it's likely you may spend more than intended. In that case, prepare to spend, and prepare to indulge - it really is a dream. The sides are in my opinion, totally forgettable. Broccoli looks like they dug it out of Bob Marley's closet and simply does not rate next to this bbq. Pickles were a-okay. I know there are some people who are huge fans of the beans and potato salad. But for me, it was just not worth the extra dollars. I could be enjoying more meat! Great place to bring dad on Father's Day or a man-outing. If he is of the baby boomer generation, prep him for less-than-ideal seating or a loud atmosphere (which I like, but your parents may not) - or just show up early, they are open from 12pm on, and bbq brunch sounds like heaven to me. Do try!

Brilliant business model. The demand for their barbeque is so great that people routinely wait about an hour to get it. Now, they sell their meat from basically one deli counter, but they have enough space to easily add one or two more without compromising seating. You know, to move the line through faster. But because of the way the property is configured, even when the wait is as long as an hour, you're still on the premises. Which means, of course, you can drink while you wait. Enter the beer and whiskey bar. Have a friend save you spot in line while you go fetch a growler of delicious draft beer. An hour later, you're feeling good after a few glasses of beer and suddenly nothing sounds better than a a pound or so of delicious barbequed meats. It's impossible not to over-order. One of my favorite restaurants in all of NYC. It's always a great time.

Honestly, I don't even care if this place is called Fette SWINE, because it is down right yummy when you sink your teeth into it! By far this place is like the best BBQ joint I've been to thus far. The meat is succulent, juicy and seasoned perfectly. Best of all, it's ORGANIC. Therefore, if I could serenade this place, this is what I would write: Titled: CRAVE If I was smoked at Fette Sau Oh how innocent, pure and organic I would be.

Make sure you bring your elbows, bc u will be fighting for a seat. During a packed house, there is a free-for-all once a person gets up. My recommendation is, if you go with guests, have one person at the register and one scouting for seats. I ate the famous brisket. Upon the first bite I thought to myself, what a grand piece of meat. Idk if it's extra fatty on most slices, but mine was super fatty, but the deliciousness made up for the lack of actual meat. I also got potato salad and baked beans. The potato salad was unnecessary bc they give you free bread, and the baked beans were good. The bar was good too. They give you large portions for cheap price and they have some sodas that are non-ordinary flavors.

Not exactly what you would expect from a hole in the wall place in Brooklyn, but man this place is a gem. I went here based on a suggestion from a friend that had heard about this place but never been himself. It was absolutely awesome, the BBQ was unbelievable and they have a great beer selection.

Whenever I see a place that I want to review and then see that there are nearly 200 reviews for it, I figure I better add something good, or be funny. ?Or at least amusing, so here we go. Fette Sau serves beer by the gallon. ?There probably are other places in New York that do this, but they are definitely in the minority. If you've never been here, first read Kevin's review. ?And make your first trip up a sampler platter of everything they have. ?Decide what you like, and get more of it, since one of my few knocks on this place is that some of the stuff they serve is hit or miss. ?But then get more. ?And don't skimp on the baked beans with burnt ends. ?They get a bad rap, but are so delicious with bread. And measure the beer that you drink in gallons. ?Then get the hell out, because there's somebody else who wants your seat.

Fette Sau means Fat Pig and that's exactly how I felt in the most awesome way after eating here. A local Brooklyn friend recommended this place and I my eyes bulged at the sight of all the meat when we got to the warehouse type location. Tucked between big buildings this garage dishes out some tasty BBQ that is worth the +/- 45min line. I feel like the anticipation of it all makes you want it even more - we waited and waited staring at the slices/shreds/bones of meat being served on trays to the people in front of us, and because our mouths were drooling which with food envy we once we got to the order counter we ordered way more than we needed. We got pulled pork, pork belly, pastrami, sour pickles, coleslaw, and potato salad. The meat and sides are priced by weight. The sides are extremely necessary because eating the meat itself might cause you to have meatoverload. I loved the pork belly and coleslaw the best, my friends favored the pulled pork. We each left with bloated bellies and 2lbs heavier, thank goodness NY requires lots of walking.....

The name describes the food well, fatty pork (pig). It's not the best BBQ I had but it is pretty good. Soft and tender enough but lacking in-depth BBQ flavor. Nothing awesome. I have tried almost everything from Chinese ribs in Chinatown, to Argentinian BBQ in other countries and a variety of Southern BBQs. We had the pulled pork, pork belly, sausage, brisket, half a rack of ribs. We also had a side order of baked beans which were good, nothing ribbon worthy. Sauce and bread is okay. The beer selection is very good served in these glass jars, I guess trying to be different or hip. Inside is nice, rustic. The knives atop the beer taps on the tiled wall in the bar area give me a hint of some kind of psycho butcher shop. The seats at the bar: crazy, as if molded by the creator of Edward Scissorhands. The indoor seating are a bunch of wooden benches like back in grade school, communal dining, depending on the night, you're lucky if you get a seat. The walls lined with different cuts of meet wallpaper. The outside eating tables close too early but nice to hang out on a warm day. Should get there before 11pm. I have to say the staff are great, very nice to help on ordering by the pound. We got there at almost exactly 11pm and the staff were very nice to serve us as the last guest. It's a bit pricey though. Eighty Nine dollars for a few pounds of hyped up, needing more flavor, fatty meat. But it filled the tray and served four. There's no such thing as 3.8 stars because it comes close and is expected to be four stars but it does NOT. For its faults I will drop .8 stars to give Fette Sau only three stars, instead of adding a .2 to make it a four stars rating. I am not a fan. Overrated and Overpriced

This place rocks. Not normally a huge fan of BBQ, but I am a believer after eating at Fette Sau. Got there on Friday night right during the rush. We found seats at the bar and waited on line to get our food. The smell of the BBQ meat smoking is intoxicating and keeps your appetite strong. Since they charge you by the pound you can sample a little bit of everything. Winners: Pork Shoulder, Pork Tounge Pastrami, Beef Brisket. So flavorful and delicious. All of their sauces are excellent and each really enhances the flavor of the meat. The beer was outstanding too. Will definitely be back and I'm telling everyone I know.

Marvel idea to have people queue up and pick and weigh their food. Usually when I go to BBQ places, I have no idea what I'm ordering off a menu, which usually leads me to food envy when my neighbor ordered better than I did. not so at Fette Sau. What I see is what I get. The dude who cut up my meats was super helpful and gave good advice on how much food to get for two people. Plus, he had a cool funky williamsburgy vibe that I liked a lot :) I enjoyed my succulent brisket, pulled pork, pig cheeks and red sausage. My sister raved about the cheeks, but I was all about the brisket. I pulled apart my potato roll and stuffed it silly with meats and bbq sauce and was a very happy girl. We, a party of 7, snagged a portion of the long communal table. Although watch out for really hefty people. They tend to hog what normally two people would take up. My friend's butt cheek was hanging off the bench until we asked every so politely again if the mister could move his coat onto his lap and move down. It's like dealing with people on the subway sometimes. No one wants to say anything, but it comes to a point where it needs to be said. Love the food. Loved the pork/beef/chicken mural. Love love eating meat!

Very good BBQ in a great atmosphere, including outdoor dining. They've obviously got a good thing going here. Don't expect southern BBQ food -- this is all about meat. There's no collard greens, mac & cheese, or other classic sides. In fact, the closest that Fette comes to southern BBQ is its pulled pork shoulder. Ordering meat by the pound on large, industrial, metal trays is truly satisfying and it enables patrons to sample lots of different meats. Highlights included the famous pork belly, which put me into an immediate food coma -- it's just a slab of fat with enough flavor to knock you on your back. A spicy pork sausage was also a great surprise. Another meat highlight was the beef brisket, which although slightly dry had excellent flavor and contained especially delicious fat content. The beer selection here is another reason to come around. With around 10 mostly local options on tap -- the taps themselves are actually giant chopping/butcher knives -- and a variety of reasonably priced serving sizes from half pints ($3) right up to gallon jugs ($32), Fette Sau can pretty much hold up simply as a bar. The baked beans were an unfortunate letdown, considering all the buzz they've gotten on here. I also could have gone for another option or two when it came to the BBQ sauce... all we saw were a standard BBQ and a spicy version. Although my stomach wanted to drop a 5-star review here I knew in my brain that a few tweaks could have really made this a perfect BBQ experience. Overall impression: barbecue food is so "in" right now that there are many great options out there, yet Fette Sau is still the go-to for a lot of people because they do meat RIGHT and serve it with great beer, so despite any minor inadequacies I'll be back here quite a bit.

My favorite BBQ joint in NYC! Outside dining, w/full bar and delicious food! So perfect for spring and summer nites in Brooklyn. All the meats I've had here are very good, super tender and greatly marinated w/flavor. Lots of side dishes to choose from as well. The best part is if you order beer they serve it in a jar to you. They also leave out the huge bottle of bbq sauce on your table along w/a roll of paper towels. Place gets crowded so come early!

2.5 stars to start yes this place does have an awoesome vibe. ?The smell of smoked meats with picnic bench seating and auto body shop decor is definately cool. ?The patrons and their flannel shirts and scraggly beards only add to the ambience. ?I guess it's better to be eating in a room of hipsters then juice heads. ?Prices are fair, probably looking at spending $25 per person. But the ordering system is just a pain and if you are not a fan of communal seating this is not the place for you. Here is how I break down the food. Sauce- the tomato based one was good, the vinegar based one was good for pouring on the floor. Pork Belly- Star of the show, be aware though this must be your thing because it's all fat afterall its belly which is basically uncured thick cut bacon. ?Smokey, gelatanous and melts in your mouth. Beef brisket- Average, I love fat but way too fatty. ?Very good smoke flavor but I thought a little dry and the seasonings were lacking cause it did need the bbq sauce. Pork shoulder-Average, was a little dry and lacked flavor. But put it on a potato roll and slather on some bbq sauce and that hightens it to good. Baked beans-They were bitter and tasted like they were sittin around all night. ?Where is the sweet and smokey beans im used too? Cole Slaw- Was Bad it had green peppers which i despise and apples which added crunch but the overall taste was bland and flavorless. ? Potato salad- they tried to switch up the game here too with this mustard and vinegar tossed salad it was o.k ?best of the sides I had besides the potato rolls. Overall not bad but over-hyped, if your in the area try it out but if your making a trek probably better off making one to Dinosaur. stay away from the sides they are an after thought at best.

Fette Sau, you had so much promise! It was perhaps my fault not knowing what to expect. In 9 degree weather we had come by to take a peak on a Wednesday when it was slow. It was consumed with the smell of barbecue, had a small bar, some picnic tables and a TV fire going. "How quaint!" I thought - "We need to come back" Come Friday, this place is packed. No surprise. We wait in line like good honest people. By the time the 25 minute mark rolled around, we were 2 people away from the person who takes your order and they announced they were out of ribs. I should have known to leave right then... Its busy, I understand. The servers hustle you through the line. We had a lamb shank, a couple of small cuts, a sausage, and 2 rolls. $40 - You're joking right? Must have been the stupid rolls. I knew I shouldn't have gotten the rolls. With our giant tray, no seats were to be found. A mob of people with only a pitcher of beer sat down (no food) as a dedicated friend waited in line, while little old me held a giant tray and ate on top of a garbage can. No sympathy :( When we finally grabbed a seat, it only fit one person, so my friend stood. I left to get water and there was no water. He tried to get water at the bar but the bartender, who was just standing around and not serving anyone, refused to give him water and told him to just wait until the dispenser went back out. When asked why she couldn't just fill a glass with water, she got snippy and replied that the dispenser was going out. By god I don't think I had ever felt like such a hobo in my life. It was like we were in a 3rd world country standing in a bread line, only instead of free, this was $40. The meats were good - but the portions, service and atmosphere are terrible for the price.

The best BBQ I've had since I was down on the "Gut Trail". Blue Smoke, Rub and Hill Country are all good for NYC, but Fette Sau's brisket could hold up against the best in Texas. The pulled pork was above average, as well. My one knock is the pickels and cole slaw aren't right. If you get pulled pork in Carolina you won't find that type of Cole Slaw. And if you get brisket in Texas they use a different type of pickle. It is a small thing that goes a long way when you're taking down BBQ. Still, the place was awesome and the Brooklynites (a line seems to be a common thing - no big deal, grab a growler) come in droves to have their top-notch 'Que. Any BBQ enthusiast will be glad they ventured out to Fette Sau in Williamsburg.

Smokey goodness exudes from this place, but it doesn't come in the form of pulled pork or brisket. ?I'm sure they are good, but I've never had them. ?I stuck(literally) to my new favorite, smoked pork cheeks. ?This is by far the best piece of BBQ I've ever eaten. ?It is the cheek, as in mouth, normally very tough but when cooked properly, the sinew breaks down into an almost glue-like flavor masterpiece. ?They actually taste and texture like a short rib. ?I also tried the Akaushi beef flank, holy mother of Nippon.... These items aren't always available because they are pretty expensive, about $16LB, but so worth it, I brought some home to Denver. ?It helps that my brother is a regular and good friends with the staff and management. Wash it down with an 8yr Canadian Club Sherry Cask Whiskey, and call it a coma.

GODDAMN. PORK BELLY. (UNLIMITED) POTATO ROLLS. Everything else was forgettable: the ribs, pulled pork, beans, coleslaw. Ribs and pulled pork were dry, rather flavorless (that's where the BBQ sauce comes in). The beans were okay, which had a nice, smoky undertone, but I'm just used to the Southern beans, which are sweeter. They had their own unique spin on coleslaw, just didn't float my boat. I'll have to sit at the bar area next time and try their specialty brews. Nice, typically hipster, in-a-garage-so-it-looks-cool-without-trying-but-?we-actually-did-try decor. Get there early. We got there just before noon on Saturday, beating the long line. It filled up quickly, but the line moves rather quickly. 1) GO EARLY. 2) GET THE PORK BELLY + POTATO ROLLS. 3) SLATHER WITH BBQ SAUCE. 4) NOM-NOM.

To be fair, I really did not eat too much in this place. ?Drank a lot and that was good. ?We sampled 1/2 rack of baby back ribs and some pulled pork. ?Aside from the meat being cold, it was still tasty. ? But the atmosphere was terrific. ?Good looking people, all squished together side by side. ?Grinning with bbq, dripping off the side of their face. ?Ahhhh, you have to hand it to pork, it really brings people together.

Mixed feelings. Good scene, with indoor and outdoor spaces, large picnic tables, meat tonged right onto a big paper-lined tray. It's a little pricey, and I always consider it overpriced, but it really is one of the few places that strive for real, down-home BBQ. The meat doesn't come pre-lathered in molassesy sauce, so you can chose how much and what kind goes on what. You will want to put some sauce on, though, 'cause a few of the cuts have a a very similar taste. Oh, and if you're like me and looking for a fatty chunk of pork-belly, you'll probably be in luck here. Gross, I know. I'm sick in the head. They have wall with mouth-watering micro-brew taps that'll make stop cringing at the fact that you're in Williamsburg where nobody takes credit cards. Bring cash everywhere outside of Manhattan.

Easily one of my favorite restaurants in New York. Delicious, delicious barbecued meat of all kinds. Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water. I've been here a bunch of times and have always walked away happy and very full. It's even better when it's nice out and you can sit outside with your tray of tasty meat and a jug of good beer. Normally, I'm fairly sympathetic to vegetarians and vegans. Not when it comes to Fette Sau - I feel bad that they can't taste and savor the epicurean delight that is Fette Sau's barbecued meat. Go hungry, and go early or much later at night. Due to its rising popularity (and especially when outdoor seating isn't available), it can get very crowded and tough to find a place to sit.

I was introduced to this place about a month ago....I've already been back twice. I was a little tempted to take a star off because of the long lines and limited seating space, but a place that focuses on meat, American whiskey, and beer...? Look, if you're going to try and stack this place up against Kreitz's or the Salt Lick or other famous BBQ places, then yes, Fette Sau is going to come up a bit short, but you're not in Texas at the moment and this place is still pretty damned good.

THE BEST MEAT ANYWHERE!!! ?I love this place, the long lines only makes the food tastes better. ?I do wish there were more seats available, the worst thing is having gotten your food, holding your tray of meat, and not having any place to sit and dive in. Their pork belly is divine, and the beef brisket to die for. ?Beef ribs are fantastic. ?They use the same rub on everything, which is also available for purchase. ?If I lived near the restaurant, I'd probably go several times a week.

Easily the most overrated restaurant in the neighborhood. If you are from, or have ever eated BBQ in the south, it is obvious why Fette Sau is a pretender. The only reason i give this food 2 stars is because the meat is of good quality and the place is comfortable. That stuff aside this is a 1 star joint. Each one of the sides is worse than the last and on top of that they cost an assload. I know good BBQ does not require sauce, but having a bangin' sauce is a good measuring stick of a BBQ spot. This place has 3 sauces, that if they were appropriately titled would be called: Bitter Diarrhea, Spicy Monkey Piss, and Zebra Cum. Just plain awful. My unrelenting BBQ lust and its close proximity to my home are the only reasons i keep giving Fette Sau a chance, But it NEVER fails to disappoint.

A great selection of bourbon and fantastic BBQ! The meat falls from the bone - its true, this is what BBQ fanatics strive for. Also, if you arrive late after the kitchen closes, you can still order from a petite menu, which offers the pulled pork slider sized sandies. mmmm... Lastly, the half pint option is a great idea for those who want to try local brewery beers or just have an option while chowing down. Don't go looking for a light meal or salad, you won't find it...warning: you may leave with hair on your chest, well worth it.

I like Fette Sau, a lot. Their brisket is delicious, so they obviously know what they're doing. Why, then, would they force me to use a fucking butter knife to cut it if I eat it there? Have they ever tried to cut brisket with a butter knife? That shit is annoying. It is possible to do, but when I'm trying to get brisket into my mouth, struggling with a dull blade is not high on my priority list. I'm not a fan of their paper takeaway packaging, either, but that's too many rants for one Yelp review. Knife equality for brisket eaters now!

Really overpriced for average food and terrible service. The nicest person in here was the busboy. Spent over $100 for what? Fatty brisket, mediocre pulled pork, and ok sides. The only things that were good were the ribs and the ginger beer. Went up to ask the checkout girl a question about the bill.... What everything is because nothing is identified on the bill, only a list of numbers... The response I got was "I assure you everything is correct". I just wanted to know what everything was, I didn't say it was wrong! Then she continued to point to the tip jar and say "and that's the tip jar" seriously????? I'm positively certain that there are much better places in the city for ribs and ginger beer. Completely overrated. Spend your money elsewhere (and you'll get more for your money).

Best BBQ spot I've ever been to. When we first moved to Williamsburg Fetter Sau was definitely our go-to dinner joint. It's amazing. The only reason I can't give it a 5-star rating is because it's ALWAYS crowded, and with the cafeteria, seat yourself set up, you usually end up standing there with your tray of food waiting for someone to get up then rushing to beat the other 20+ people waiting for a seat. Overall, I do enjoy the atmosphere, the painted wall with the different cuts of cow and pig. The beers are good as well and come in a large jar like carafe for sharing. They're open late, and keep the bar open with a limited food menu of all the meat thats already been cut for the day, aka scraps, but it still tastes great when you're jonsing for some grub late. Plus they deliver! (I do think that you kinda get gipped though when you order take out... It never seems to be as much food as when you're physically there watching them weigh it out. Still, on those cold winter days its so convenient.)

Overrated. It's good, but after waiting in line for literally well over an hour, you are famished, which is why you think it tastes amazing. The food is the same as Hill Country (like almost the same menu), but Hill is appropriately staffed so you don't have the ridiculous wait. So my advice is to just go there, OR the Kansas CIty BBQ place in LIC.

I adore Fette Sau. While it is definitely not the best BBQ in the world (and hopefully no one is arguing that) it is the best in Brooklyn. You pay by the pound (as you should) great sides, excellent pork belly and brisket. Gallons of beer and shots of whiskey. best tip: mix all of the sauces and show up off hours.

Wow, this place is fantastic! While visiting NYC we came here on a Friday night for dinner and it was totally worth the hour wait. We met some really nice people in line, got a gallon of delicious beer to share amongst the 7 of us and waited in line to order food. We found a table big enough to seat our group and the food came up really fast. You pay the pound and we got A LOT of food. We ordered the beef cheeks (AMAZING), brisket, ribs, pulled pork, baked beans, pickels, potato salad and sausages. Everything was so tasty and the baked beans were by far the best side. I wish we had something like this in Chicago! I definitely didn't feel like I was in Brooklyn. I also loved the decor and the style of the place. Just another good reason to go back to NY!

There is little more that I can add to everyone's previous sentiments. This is the best meat you will eat. On this particular evening I had the beef cheek, pork ribs, pulled pork, brisket, broccoli salad, baked beans, and sausage.

I've been going here for years and love it. It's some of the best BBQ I've had in NYC, for sure. One of my favorite things is swinging in late and finishing the night off with some pulled pork and a beer. The normal Friday bartender (Branden...? Or was it Alex?) is super nice and knowledgable about every whiskey on the wall behind him. Unfortunately, the bartender told me last night that the late menu is no longer offered. Which sucks for a couple reasons. One, I've lost my almost weekly Friday night cap. I might as well get my last beer at a bodega and head home now. Two, it was one of the only ways to enjoy the BBQ these days. It's so busy the rest of the time. I'll miss those beans...

Liked the hipster atmosphere but the meat was just so-so. Brisket had a layer of fat and you had to use a knife to cut it... NOT the way brisket is supposed to be. Pork ribs way too fatty. Sides of cole slaw, broccoli slaw and kraut totally forgettable. What was good was the beans (lots of chunks of burnt ends in there) and the unassuming hot dog that is sitting on a bed of grilled kraut inside the heated counter; both kraut and dog were stellar though I wish I had demanded more kraut (though I am not sure they would have given it to me; a dining companion was refused a single slice of brisket which would have netted the establishment $3 or so). Not impressed with the beer selection as an IPA drinker. Brooklyn is the house brand, not exceptional. A few others I tasted way too mild. Still, as a Texan I get goose bumps when I am served meat on a sheet of greasy butcher paper so thank you for that. Also, the BBQ sauces were excellent (mix of hot and sweet achieved the perfect balance).

What is better than meat, whiskey, and beer? Well nothing, but combining the three in one convenient location sure competes with the individual components. Fette Sau is an innovative place. ?Upon walking in a room redolent of a dank, western pit, you are faced with a case of delicious meats on the right and a small bar on the left [not to mention the old-school wooden benches for patrons to dine]. ?The bar - which features great craft brews, including 2 beers brewed specifically for the restaurant - sells beer by the half pint, pint, half gallon, and gallon for your dining pleasure. ?There is too a tremendous selection of whiskey. This however ain't your average dining experience - expect no waitress to politely ask, "What can I get for y'all." ?Stake a spot, *if* you can, and then head to the aforementioned meat counter where barbeque is sold by the pound. ?Come hungry, folks. The food is darn good. ?I LOVED the beef ribs and the pulled pork. ?We flew through our order(s) of collard greens. ?The brisket was too fatty for me to enjoy, although I know that's preferable for some. ?What can I say? I'm a lean cut kind of girl. ?I heard the pork belly was "divine." ?The pork ribs were a bit dry, although they were reminiscent of the ribs featured at the "best smokehouse" in Mobile, Alabama [The Brick Pit]. Translation: it was fairly authentic - albeit with Billyburg prices [which are not *that* bad]. My only real complaint is the lack of seating. ?My party, which ordered a ton of food and alcohol, were then obliged to munch with heavy hearts, for hungry eyes glared at us with jealousy. ?Despite the guilt, I subscribe to the "no man left behind" tenet. ?I sat there, ate and drank until it was all gone, then followed it up with more drinks at its awesome brother bar "Spuyten Duyvil." ?Good location, good food, good vibe.

Fresh off a visit to the Xinjiang BBQ cart in Chinatown, my cousin and I wandered over to Fette Sau to double down on the grilled meat fest! ?Part barbeque mecca, part beer hall and part bar, Fette Sau is tucked away down a small alleyway marked by a pink neon sign. ?Pass the picnic tables and brown/pink motif, you'll find a very cool and hip barbeque cavern. ?To the right, a simple display case of charred meats and a blackboard with the special of the day. ?To the left, a full bar with beer taps on proud display. ?Fette Sau specializes in Berkshire Heritage pork which is a high-end breed raised for its flavor and taste. ? The friendly dude behind the counter made some recommendations on the chow. ?We ordered a couple of sausages, a rack of st. louis ribs, collard greens, baked beans, pickle and a bit of fatback. ?We paid up and wandered over to the bar. ?Very pretty setup here, they've got these wonderful wrought iron bar stools that look like they came out of a secret garden. ?Good selection of brews and bourbon to choose from. ?Drinks in hand, we hoofed it out to the outdoors picnic tables to eat our meal a la natural. The meat was wonderfully charred and smoked. ?A bit pink on the inside, blackened crust on the outside. ?Meat fell off the bones along with the delicious fattiness. ?The fatback is a thick grilled piece of meat that will literally drip when you bite into it. ?Proceed with caloric caution! ?You can eat the meat without any additions or try one of the four que sauces at the table. ?Collard greens were rich and spiked with meats, the beans were deeply baked but not my fave. ?Throw in some potato rolls to finish off your meal and sop up the juices. ? Fette Sau means fatted pig in German and it certainly means the same in English in Williamsburg. ?I rolled out of the place, stuffed, full and happy. ?Not sure what would have happened if we had ordered a gallon of beer, I'm glad we held back. ?What I can tell you is that Fette Sau is a wonderful meat-atorium in Williamsburg, ?Check it out if you've got a serious appetite and a hankering for delicious charred meats and beer in hand. ?You can't beat the food, ambiance and atmosphere in this cool biersch, barbeque and bourbon garden!

The food here, awesome BBQ. The seating, picnic tables. The beer, poured from meat cleavers (see pic) and delicious. Decoration, no frills. Our group got 1.5 pounds of three types of meat (pork belly, brisket, pulled pork) piled on to a baking tray. Coleslaw, baked beans, pickle and rolls on the side. Paper plates were provided and we dove in. Did I mention the pork belly? Oh yes, try that.. fantastic. Drank a couple of jugs of the porter, excellent. We got there just after they opened, slightly after our arrival, it was packed. Line out the door even. So get there early!

It was my first time trying pork belly, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I'm a new fan. The rub on the ribs was fabulous. I kept licking it. The beans might have been the best I've ever had.

Good spot, the only drawback is the wait. It's cafeteria style with only one person serving food. ?I was told to get there early when it opened at five. ?We got there at 6 and waited in line for 30-40 minutes. ?Now to the food: Ribs were KC style and good. ?I'm not usually a fan of KC style but these definitely impressed me. Beef brisket was decent, dry but had pretty good flavor. Pork Joul was amazing and the best thing on the menu! ?Warning that it's fatty but it's amazing. ?Everybody knows fat is where the flavor is. Spicy pork sausage was decent, not as spicy as I expected and little too dry for me. Greens were good, almost as good as down South. ?Baked beans were good, crisp, and had god flavor.

Very casual but with a level of sophistication and professionalism as exemplified by the quality and appeal of the food. Order meats by the pound (or 1/4 lb, 1/2) and pick a few sides. The pulled pork and brisket were delicious! The house sauce that accompanies the BBQ at Fette Sau is just perfect. Twangy, sweet, with some heat and well balanced. The burnt ends baked beans were deep with color and flavor. Another satisfaction! The slaw was pretty good; it almost seemed Asian-influenced as there may have been ginger or sesame oil in it? It worked out though. Full liquor, and beer available. They'll fill a growler for you too! Seating can be cozy, so you may have to share a table with others. The outdoor seating looks most appropriate on days with good weather. Can't wait to return.

The Whiskey Flights, the boneless beef ribs, the smoked sausage, baked beans, and beer by the gallon to stay or to go. My jacket is going to smell like smoked meat for the rest of winter and quite frankly, I like it. And if the aroma should fade? Yeah, I'd do it again. Yes, Fette Sau gets 5 stars in my book. Why? Read the first line of this review again.

Urgh, it is so frustrating that you can't give half stars on Yelp! I really feel like this place deserves 3.5 stars, because I'm a fan of the pulled pork but otherwise was not particularly impressed. My hubby and I both really liked the pulled pork. It was firmer and less stringy than we're used to, and had a nice, deep smokey flavor. My husband loved the barbecued bacon and I definitely understand the appeal, but I couldn't handle the thick chunks of gelatinous fat throughout the meat. The brisket was okay, but wasn't that flavorful and again had lots of gooey fat around it, which I wish could have been melted into the meat to moisten it a little. We had the baked beans, which were very sweet and smokey, but I found them to be almost too syrupy and over-seasoned. For me, the most important component of good barbecue is the sauce. Fette Sau's sauces really left something to be desired. I ?found the lighter red sauce to be too sweet and syrupy and the darker sauce had a nice flavor of chilies but was otherwise very bland (virtually no sweetness of saltiness). Mixed together, though, they worked pretty well. (They also have a vinegar sauce on the table, but that's not my cup of tea..) I admittedly haven't eaten much bbq in NYC yet, so I'm not sure how this place ranks in terms of what's available in the city, but I've had my fair share of hipster (as well as old school) BBQ in Chicago and would say that Fette Sau falls short of most I've tried when it comes to their sauce and their brisket, but stands out with their pulled pork.

First time there... not a great first impression. Staff was friendly and good at recommending meats. Young crowd... but when I went there were huge groups drinking after work... so it was hard to get a seat. When people did finally leave, we found seats, came back and our stuff was moved. I guess you have to get here early. I'm not into the anarchy-type restaurant. If I'm paying $40 bucks, I don't want to be fighting over a table. Probably won't be back here... but the food is good. Though Wildwood BBQ in the city is probably just as good.

Gotta update this to a 4 star. My boyfriend's been bringing this home from his trips to Brooklyn lately (a lot of his family lives spitting distance from this place) and I'm really coming around to it. Still not my favorite BBQ in the city, but man, when it's good, it's REALLY good. Maybe even the best. Unfortunately, it's inconsistent so I can't give it 5 stars. Last night, for example, my boyfriend brought home beef rib (good), brisket (PHENOMENAL), sweet sausage (good), and pork ribs (still the best). The beef rib was the worst of it and it was still mighty tasty. And man, when they get the brisket right, it rivals Hill Country. Sliced thick, with a nice strip of fat running through it, it is some delicious brisket, especially with the tasty vinegar-based sauce. So, still hit or miss, but when it's on, it's ON.

FOOD CRAWL STOP #7: *drinks only!* This place has over 500 reviews and I didn't even eat here, but for the sake of detailing my food crawl list I'll throw in my 2 cents. My pals and I had an hour to kill between our travel up from Nyonya and our finale stop at Traif. ?What's the logical time killer? Whiskey and locally-brewed beer, of course! Both were delicious, and I kind of dig the barbarian vibe of this Williamsburg BBQ joint. ?I'd come back here for food sometime when I hadn't already eaten 3 dinners and was on my way to my 4th.

Probably the best bbq that I have ever had in NYC(Sorry Dinosaur, Hill Country, Daisy Mae's). I tried the ribs, brisket and pork belly and it was all great. The spice and smoke on the ribs were perfect - falling off the bone, tongue tingling spicey combined with a beautiful red smoke ring. The bbq sauces were delicious as well - I preferred the sweet red sauce, but the chipotle sauce was very good as well. I also enjoyed the half sour pickles and the asian cole slaw. My only minor complaint was that they should make there own sweet tea and offer homemade lemonade. Loved the "fireplace", ?long communal tables and the low key ambience. Can't wait to go back to try the boneless beef ribs and pork shoulder. So good. Prices are not shy, but reasonable.

Fette Sau, is a German style barbeque joint. Hot dogs, hamburgers, sausages and mustard- it's easy to forget that these "all-American" barbecue staples we crave this time of year originally came from Germany. The set up remindes me of the old BBQ joints in San Antoino TX this place is usually croweded and it can be hard to get a seat but if you do it will be the best BBQ you can get north of the Mason-Dixion line and that says a lot being im from VIrgina. The meat is of prime quality Berkshire Pork, Black Angus Beef I had the pork belly was amazing and the beef brisket was great and the ribs had a beautiful smoke ring on it from the hours of smoking in the BBQ pit. If you ever go you will return unless your Vegan.

Can a place be unpretentious to the point of pretentiousness? If so, Fette Sau is. No table service - wait in line, order food, grab beers served in Ball Jars at the bar, and find some open seats. My advice, dont go when its busy. A random Tuesday at 10pm is ideal in my opinion. The best beef brisket Ive ever had, deliciously smokey and incredibly fatty, eating this made even me feel guilty and Im the furthest possible thing from a vegan. Baked beans were good and smokey, not too sweet, but I prefer those at Thighs and Pies. The hot sauce is an acquired taste - its nothing like the Franks style most of us grew up on around here but its sufficient for a bit of heat. BBQ sauce is great - spicy, flavorful and pretty sweet- just like you would imagine it. Ribs and other cuts are all good, but the food is very heavy - you might need a nap after eating a lot of it.

8 people. 7 pounds of meat. 2 giant jugs of beer. Pure bliss. Long line, but the food, experience, and ambiance were well worth the wait. There's also sort of a communal feel to this place because you're sitting at long benches, so some of us were talking to other groups of people. There were some Australians who were popular with some of the girls, and a very happy couple who were bequeathed the rest of beer jug #2. It was a good night.

The Pork Belly was the most amazing piece of meat I have ever sunk my teeth into. The baked beans were great, but they were a little too rich to finish the whole thing. The girlfriend loved her Beef Brisket, but she said it was just a little dry in the middle. The beers were good too. I plan to return and try more of their stuff! Long lines are made to feel shorter by friendly people with giant gallon jugs of beer. The Nunu Chocolates were awesome. Like butterfingers but WAY better. The place has probably the least refined atmosphere I've ever eaten in, but I loved it. I've eaten in a barn before, so that's no small feat.

Okay, so update- I went and I tried and it's okay. I love the aesthetic of the place and I love the idea, but it's not my favorite barbecue. As a matter of fact, I'd go to Dinosaur over Fette Sau any time now that I've had both and can say 100% that I love Dinosaur more. Now, I'm not trashing Fette Sau at all because it still smells f'ing amazing, but here are my thoughts: 1. My friend and I ordered a lot of food. It's really difficult to determine just how much is too much or too little. I mean, unless you're a part-time butcher, how does someone hungry for bbq know that 2 pounds of meat may just be too much? So I suggest to always skimp on the amounts, especially since everything is sold by the lb. ? 2. Of all the meat we got: Lamb shank, pulled pork, brisket, pork belly, and one link of sausage my favorite was the pork belly and the sausage. The brisket was eh, the pulled pork, I've had better and the lamb shank just didn't do a damn thing for me. 3. The sides: we got broccoli salad, baked beans, potato salad and pickles. The pickles were less vinegary cucumbers, which if it's your thing, then you're solid. The broccoli salad, eh. The black beans are good, but don't expect sweet, brown sugar beans. Lastly the potato salad, was alright. I wouldn't call home about it. So yeah, that's it. I so wanted to love this place. I loved it from smelling it, but as the saying goes, you can't judge a book by it's cover. You can judge bbq without eating it.

I grew up in Rochester, NY, home to Dinosaur BBQ and Sticky Lips. ? With that said, barbecue has always been a top priority for me, and it is something I take very seriously. ?I used to make the ten mile trek on my bike from my Brooklyn apartment to the Harlem Dinosaur when I was really craving barbecue, but after visiting Fette Sau last week, I see it as a good choice for when I'm not up to the long ride. The atmosphere is really great, I like the knives and meat cleavers on the taps, meat cut diagrams on the wall, and long cafeteria tables make for a fun and stimulating atmosphere. ?Ordering meat by the pound is pretty excessive and things can get expensive, but that's part of the fun. ?I tried everything on the menu, admittedly some things were a little over cooked but for the most part I found everything to be satisfying. Craft beers and whiskey selection were also a great addition and added to the atmosphere. ?While it may not be the absolute best barbecue in NYC, it has a good atmosphere; my friends and I all had a great time pounding beers and piling on the meat.

I didn't really understand how this place worked until AFTER I ordered my food by just mimicking what my friends ordered. So let's not let you make the same mistake as me: The list of meats and prices on the wall: that's per pound. Go ahead and order a 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 or even a full pound from the charming gentleman behind the meat case. When getting meat: Don't be afraid to ask for more when they're weighing it out! 1/4 lb of brisket is two healthy slices, but I could have absolutely had two more. Get extra rolls! They are free, I didn't know this until I sat down and wondered why I didn't have the amount of rolls on my tray as my friend did. BBQ Sauce: Use it, use lots of it! Dip your rolls in it, cover your ribs in it- its absolutely delicious. Beer: Get a gallon to share, It worked out to be 2.5 beers each for the four of us. Make friends: You are forced to sit communal style, we made friends with people who ordered pounds and pounds of meat they couldn't finish and had gallons of beer with drinks undrank- when they were leaving we were offered anything we wanted! Which was more beer! I can't comment on the sides because I didn't get any, I'd love to try the beans and the pickles next time though. This has to be hands down, the best BBQ I've had however and who would have thought this was a hidden gem in Brooklyn?! Everyone here is really nice, when the bartender got me a sample of the double white she didn't walk away and forget about me before getting our opinion and order. The price was great - 1/4 lb of brisket and a 1/4 lb of ribs was under $9. The ribs and brisket are absolutely delicious, I didn't get a chance to try the pulled pork but my friends were raving over it. Next time though, I'll be more prepared for this experience.

I heard a lot about Fette Sau and was really looking forward to attacking some BBQ. I live in the East Village and getting there from the L was nice and easy. There are things I really like about Fette Sau, and things I really don't like. The likes: The brisket is wonderful. Perfect actually. The BBQ sauce worked really well with the smokiness of the meat. The sausage is amazing too. It's spicy, but not too bad, just enough kick to get your attention. Also the pulled pork is probably the best thing I had there. I want mounds of it on a bun with their sauce and I'd be in hog heaven. The dislikes: For a first timer it's a little confusing. There's no hostess, no wait staff and I wasn't really sure what to do. I figured it out quickly though. I hate the system they have in place there. I stand in line. I order and get my food. Go to the bar. Order a drink. Then go find a seat (which can be challenging on a busy night, especially if you're with a group.) By the time you sit down to eat, your food is cold. Real annoying. Over all it was okay. I may go back on a week night around 6, hopefully it'll be slower and easier to sit down.

I'm going against the grain here and I pronounce Fette Sau's sausages below par.. Too greasy and the grind isn't to my liking. I'm difficult to please when it comes to meat stuffed colons to the point that when I can't go and buy Myer's Cumberlands I make my own and I'm not far from the tall bar that Mr Myer has set me. I do love the brisket, the relaxed seating and the beer selection and I'm a fan. It seems it's the place for the 'burg kids to gather and rejoice in meat.

Walking through the cruddy streets of Williamsburg, (I can hate on this place, I used to live here!) the only thing that lifted my spirits was the scent of BBQ meats as I approached Fette Sau. Here are the highlights of the meal: - Gallon containers of beer: you just can't go wrong there. - Pork belly: full of fatty goodness - Ribs: moist with a nice blackened crust from their home-made dry-rub. - Baked beans: tasted more like a chili than just beans, but delicious, especially with the huge chucks of bacon, or burnt ends, in it - Potato buns: I don't eat grains much these days, but when I do, it's potato buns.

Stacks of meat, growlers of beer, what more could you ask. A BBQ with a long list of smoked meats and a long line to match. Can't go wrong with the brisket or the pork belly, if you get confused there's an 8-foot tall chart of a sectioned-off cow and pig to help you keep track of all the cuts. The sides play second fiddle, and , admittedly, the lack of mac is somewhat disappointing. Go for the baked beans and tater salad, and a few pickles are essential. Lots of great beers on tap to wash it all down, which you can get served to you in anything from pints to gallon-jugs. Plenty of whiskeys too. Seating inside and out at long, communal tables. A lot of meat-, beer-, and table-sharing make this place good for groups. Not cheap, but a good value.

Okay, in anticipation that my remarks may cause a bit of debate, I'm prefacing that my views are based solely on my, perhaps limited experience with BBQ. Best BBQ in NYC? Yes. Best BBQ in the Northeast US? Yes. Best BBQ I've ever had? ... Yeah, maybe I know it's borderline heresy to say that anything but southern BBQ is amazing, but perhaps my memory of southern BBQ has faded a bit. Everything at Fette Sau tasted wonderful. They have a rotating menu of various barbecued meats each day. I particularly enjoyed the brisket and the pork shoulder. Unfortunately I was not of legal drinking age while I lived in New York, so I wasn't able to participate in drinking beer out of mason jars, but I thought it was pretty cool. The restaurant is in a garage with seating mostly at long picnic tables. It was always packed when I went there, and everyone was really friendly. Even if you're only visiting New York to see Manhattan and think Williamsburg is a bit out of the way, trust me, it's worth it. Go to Fette Sau. You won't regret it.

Why hello there Mr Piggy. My how tasty you look today. You would look even better in my belly! Hmmm pork...vegetarians look away now... Country rib is the thing to have! Granted they don't have real knives and you're stuck cutting your pork with a butterknife, you gotta work hard for your pork! Wed night they slaughter and smoke a whole pig, so Thursday you can stuff your face with the lovely pig. Hmmm pig... You will come out smelling like smoked pork, which is a good thing at first, but not later in the night when the dogs come up and sniff you. Its communal seating, so you will have strangers sitting next to you, but most of the time they're friendly. Well most of the time. This place is located in hipster williamsberg, and well I HATE hipsters. With their super tight jeans, huge black nerd glasses, stupid hats, and scarfs, and sunglasses they wear indoors! Go away hipsters so I can eat in peace! They have a whiskey bar there too! Enjoy good drinks, good pork and good times. Yes its dark in there, don't go flash camera crazy here people! Bring your own knife if you want to cut up your meat. The TSA won't get you for that.

Fette Sau was great and would have gotten 5 stars from me if: (a) I was more into BBQ; or (b) they had sandwiches; or (c) they had more vegetable sides The Meat: The pulled pork was some of the best I have ever had, and the sweet sauce was an excellent compliment. The brisket (which I only had a small taste of) was perfect. The ribs looked really good, if a little tough. My dining companion can't shut up about the pork belly, but it looked pretty gross to me. They do give you little dinner rolls, and I made them into sandwiches, but I would have liked to have a real pulled pork sandwich. The Sauces: There are two. One is sweet and tangy and delicious. The other is spicy (chipotle) and rich and also delicious. I stuck to the sweet, which went really well with the pork. I think the other would be a good pairing for some of the beefs on the menu. The Booze: Very good selection of beer on tap that you can get in a range of volumes from 1/2 pint to 1 gallon, and reasonably priced too! Also great bourbon selection, and a super-helpful bartender to guide you through the menu based on your tastes and price range. The Sides: I just had the potato salad, which was a good, no-mayo version. The only real vegetable in the place was the broccoli salad, which looked a little sad on other people's trays - it looked kind of gray and overcooked. There are also pickles and sauerkraut, but I would have liked some slaw to go with my pulled pork. The Atmosphere: Picnic tables inside and out. It was pretty packed when we got there on a Sunday at 6:30, but the place is set up for table-sharing, so unless you are a big group, you can probably find a place to squeeze in somewhere.

Everything here is spot-on and awesome, besides the broccoli salad, it is gross. Beans=Best Ever Pork Shoulder=Very Tender Ribs=Super Tasty Beer Selection=Perfect Match for the BBQ Justin=Full of BBQ when I leave Plus the counter girls are really really friendly. ?The key if you go in a group is to split up, two people prowl for seats/buy beer while the other person/peoples order and pay for the food.

Wow this place is fantastic! What makes it even better is that they serve GALLON jugs of beer! What other place do you know of that serves gallon jugs of good beer for a mere $32? Then on top of that you get to enjoy a meat fest. I believe that I would have to travel down south in order to get that combo. I had the boneless beef ribs and they were awesome. Whatever dry rub that they use is perfect and the meat just melts in your mouth. This was one of the best dining experiences that I have had in Williamsburg and the dining atmosphere is so comfortable. It feels like the kind of place that can be right in your backyard. The food portions are a little deceiving in a good way. A small cup of baked beans and a small broccoli salad look do-able when you see the container but once you start eating them after enjoying the meat, it ?seems like a mountain that you have to climb in order to finish. I would absolutely go back to Fette Sau, it delivers everything that I love about dining out.

When writing a yelp review, it is generally a little more fun to write reviews for places a zillion people haven't already reviewed, just the same as it is more fun to recommend places to your friends that they haven't already heard about. However, Fette Sau has a special place in my heart (the meat place), and I went to Fette Sau on Sunday for V-Day with my gentleman friend, and we scarfed ourselves some MEAT; and now I am reminded that I really should write a little something about this place which I have frequented most frequently. Their meats are always fantastic - initially I was in love with the pork belly, with its lovely melt-in-your-mouth rendered fatty interior and crispy dark dry-rubbed exterior. ?Mmmm... ?Nowadays I have discovered that my true favorite is the beef brisket, a wholly unglamorous cut of meat - none of the wow factor of pork belly, beef cheeks, roasted bbq duck, and the like. ?But it is my mouth's favorite, and mouth is boss. Other things I heart about Fette Sau: -The cuteness factor, dipping a toe in kitsch and coming out charming. -The bar - selection, cute/dangerous knife taps, whiskey flights. -Communal seating, which is always simultaneously fun and a pain. -The skeevy entrance. As far as I am concerned, Fette Sau is the go-to place for BBQ. ?They've really boiled down BBQ to its fatty, smokey essence, rejected all nonessential fluff, and played up the awesomeness of casual meat-centric, whiskey-loving dining.

This place is a good time... not only do you get to eat some delicious food, but there is some good hipster watchin' action as well. The food was great. I would highly recommend the brisket and the sausage. Both were perfect. The ribs were good. The pulled pork was kinda what ever. But the real reason you should go here is the bourbon... the selection is fantastic, and the prices are somewhat reasonable, and on top of that they have the best ice cube in Brooklyn (those of you that have been here know what I'm talking about). The only complaints I have are the above mentioned what ever pulled pork, and the face that the bar tender did not know any thing about bourbon... If I'm going to a place that claims to have one of the best bourbon selections in Brooklyn I would appreciate a little direction from the person who's serving me.....

Yummy. The brisket and ribs could have used a bit more smoke flavor but were very good. Sauerkraut and beans were delicious. Prices of food and drink very reasonable.

Had we guessed weights (the meat is sold by weight) we definitely would have over ordered. Thanks!

If it was possible to give half stars I would have given 3 1/2 stars for this place. ? Don't get me wrong there is nothing bad about this place except how small it is and how you have to scout out tables if you are with a large group, which I hear during the nice weather hours is almost impossible. ? The food was great! I had the Brisket, Sausage, Porkbelly and pulled pork. ?The brisket was a little dry but that wasn't a problem because they have amazing ?bbq sauce at this place! ?For sides it was a cold broccoli salad, cole slaw and potato salad which were all pretty good. ? They were a little pricy and I guess I am a little bias because I have been to Hill Country which in my opinion is much better, sorry Fette Sau. ?There is nothing negative I can say about the food just that the place really small so if you plan on going, plan ahead of time and expect to wait. ?They make you pay as soon as you order your food so order enough other wise you will have to wait on line again.

So hey. If you are some bbq freak who has had it at 46 of the top 50 places in Memphis, I don't want to hear any of your yakking. Well if they started Spuyten Duyvil, how bad could it be? Right? Right. I think the food is nicely done. The meat definitely brings the flavor and rightly so as it's slow cooked Love the supe fatty pork belly. And since I hate basically every potato salad known to man, I am glad that theirs is a little bit different. I, in fact, do love it. The sauce is good, but there is only one of them that I like of the two. Good beer selection, some of which are made exclusively for them. But where they shine with the alcohol is the bourbons! Jeez!

I love ordering my BBQ by the pound and eating cafeteria style on long communal tables. Bonus points for the bar and being able to get beer by the growler! Nothing better than eating messy BBQ with friends on the outdoor tables with my jar of beer! The only thing that kept this place from 5 stars were the meh sides.

I'm so happy it's spring so that my beer-guzzling friends and I can rush here after work, order a gallon of dark ale and gorge ourselves on all things pork, including the brisket, which melts in your mouth. If you show up here right at 5 PM when they open, you can score one of the coveted picnic tables outdoors. The goal for my next trip is to try more of the sides. I vaguely remember pickles and potato salad. I'm sure there's much, much more to savor.

Good brisket. I still like Hill Country better for that, though. I went with my mouth salivating over the thought of bbq'd pork belly and I was not disappointed when I saw it on the list of meats for the day. However, when I bit into the pork belly it was so SALTY. The fat was excellent, the meat (what little there was) was quite succulent. I had to stuff bread in my mouth to counteract the salty. I'm sad. As a lover of almost all piggy bits I wish they'd lower the salt on the belly. Maybe I just got an extra salty batch. My boyfriend had a few pork ribs, some brisket and a sausage. I had a 1/2 pound of pork belly, a sausage and some brisket with the half sour pickles. Half of what I had is in the fridge at work waiting for a lovely lunch time treat. I also picked up a small beans to see what all the fuss was about. It wasn't all that expensive because we didn't get very much. ?It probably came out to $40-45 for the both of us with his ?beer and my cream soda. While I went up to get to-go bags and the beans he ate my roll. The glare on my face was epic for all of 4 seconds. :P Luckily I asked for bread with the beans. Brisket: Good, but not as moist as Hill Country Sausage: Nice and flavorful, sort of reminded me of an italian sausage to my dismay. I still like the Elgin sausages (both from the source and those you can get at Dinosaur BBQ) Pork Belly: Deliciously fatty, but much too salty Pickles: Yum Cream soda: Meh The sweetish red sauce in the tallest container: awesome in small doses The chipotle (at least I think that's what it was) whatever red sauce in the smaller container: PASS. They really need some sides I'd spend money on. Boyfriend got the potato chips. Even just another potato side without "salad" in the name would be awesome.. or some greens (mustard, collared, kale, turnip, I'm not picky.. hell even some non krauted cabbage)

If you've never tried BBQ in Texas, Tennessee, or North Carolina, then you'll be content with Fette Sau. However, if you come from any of those places then you are going to be disappointed. I made the trek to Williamsburg to see what all of the fuss was about. They were out of the pork belly, so I ordered a pound of Angus brisket, half a pound of pork ribs, and a small side of beans. The ribs were advertised as 'dry-rub', but I wouldn't have thought the meat would have been as dry as they turned out to be. The ribs and brisket I am used to are moist and juicy with wonderful flavor and sauces. Speaking of sauces, I sampled three of them. One was a dark smoky sauce that slowly built up heat. The second was some very weak thin sauce which I promptly tossed. The third was a sweeter BBQ sauce that reminded me of the stuff you can get out of a Heinz bottle at the local grocery. The beans were hearty, but the flavor was so-so. I really wanted to like this place, and was on a scouting trip to see if I was going to bring a friend visiting from Texas here. Sadly, this place is stricken from the list. I spent $32 + $3 for the 'to-go' tip. My dogs are going to enjoy the left overs. In defense of NY BBQ, a lot of the problem comes down to facility space. There isn't room for a locomotive sized smoker to make the best barbecue.

I was visiting NY with friends and our friend brought us to Fette Sau. We ordered pork shoulder, brisket, dinner rolls, and baked beans. The meat was so tender and juicy, it didn't need sauce at all. But for sauce lovers, they have a few choices for you. I enjoyed the BBQ sauce the most. The meat also made for a good sandwich with the dinner roll, sauce, and sauerkraut. The beans were good too and I don't normally like beans. It had pieces of pork in them, so it was even more good. I would definitely come here again the next time I visit NY. Don't miss out on this place. I recommend eating there. Their decor is really fun and Southern.

A shrine to the gods of meat and fire, Fete Sau may be the last place worth eating at. Even in the alternate, war-torn NYC of Brian Wood's DMZ, I imagine Fete Sau is a sacred place, neutral ground, where people put aside murderous grudges to partake in the most delicious BBQ in New York City. It's the cure for a bad day- hell, a bad week. When you can buy a couple dozen bourbons, and beer by the gallon (including their outstanding rauchbier, a style difficult to find anywhere, much less in a region more associated with PBR than microbrews), how can you do anything but smile and slip into a food coma? The brisket? Heavenly. The pulled pork? I no longer believe pigs come any other way. The sausages are outstanding, the spice can be ratcheted up to a healthy level, and the sides? THE SIDES. Potato salad my dead grandmother would be hard-pressed to match, beans with more bacon than beans, and various rotating other options. This is the new Mecca... well, unless you can't eat pork.

I've been here a dozen times and each time I leave uncomfortably full. Craft beers, whiskeys galore, and meat by the pound. I couldn't imagine a more perfect business model. The best way to order is to pick a bunch of stuff and ask the guy at the counter to fill up the tray to feed the number of people in your party. You might wanna tell him how hungry you are as well. The belly is fatty and delicious but you'll have a hard time having more than a few bites before it becomes overwhelming. The pork cheek was delicious. The sausage and the sides are just ok in my opinion. This place gets more and more packed each time I go which sorta sucks but whatever. I've noticed tourists the last few times I was there which probably means they've made it to some visitors guide somewhere. Hands down the best BBQ in the city. There I said it!

Amazing little place. The ambiance of this place is just perfect for a hipster run bbq place. Dark, looks to be reclaimed wood all over, cool stools at the bar, communal seating inside and out, an awesome mural of butcher cuts of pork and beef.....really FUN. Food definitely met our expectations. The pork shoulder was so good and so was the beef brisket. Both could be eaten without their delicious sauces. The crust on the beef was mega yum too, nice and thick and crackly. They also have a nice selection of north american liquors and beer. We got beer with the meal and then sat and had some more after, as well as free shots from our super nice bartender. Wish we lived closer! Gotta go!

It seems these days that everyone is doing a BBQ restaurant this side of the bridge. ?Some are big, some are small and others just aren't worth mentioning. ?Luckily, Fette Sau doesn't fall into the doldrums of mediocrity but manages to stand out not just for the vibe but more importantly the food. Having just moved to the neighborhood I wasn't quite sure where it was. ?I could smell the place before I could see it which is always a good sign. ?Basically it looks like something out of an old garage which is true, inside are several bench seats where it is first come first serve. ?The line for food is usually super long because there is only one person weighing out the meats and one person on the cash register. ?I would have preferred to have at least another person using a separate scale but beggars can't be choosers. My biggest gripe about this place was the lack of corn bread and no chicken options among the six or so different meats. The beer was pretty cheap for the quality and is served in a variety of sizes depending on how thirsty you are or how many people you got with you. Def a spot I'll be coming back to and bringing friends with me in the future.

I have to say, I had high hopes for this place, but after going, really don't see what the fuss was about. We went on a saturday afternoon. Not too crowded, quick line for the meat, and easy to find seating. The place is interesting. Open indoor area, with kind of a small warehouse feel. Let's get to the food and beer though. Beer selection is good. 5 bucks for a pint, which is a decent price. We ordered brisket, pulled pork, pickles, and a side of cole slaw. Cole slaw sucked. Pickles were eh, not too flavorful though. Pulled pork was good, nothing extraordinary though. Brisket was a little too fatty for my taste. Overall, a pretty standard bbq experience. Maybe I missed something, but I don't get what the big deal about this place is. Oh well. TL;DR: decent place, but not worth any rave reviews. Standard bbq fare.

Fette Sau. ?That's me after I left this place. ?Either I'm about as hip as someone raving about Interpol, or there is freakish synchronicity in my life (or both), but it seems to me that pig roasting has only just become "viral" due to my friends attending pig roasts all over the boroughs. ? ? Of course ?Williamsburg takes the down south barbeque/captive-on-a-spit theme and approaches it with trendy irony. ?Semi pared down surroundings, rough-hewn communal tables in homage to Williamsburg's industrial past, your food slapped onto a tray, but also the delicate wrought iron style decor trend (like the logo of Fiore, wrought iron means it's good) and the effete name. ?What it means is flagrant insult-style direct, we are at Fatte Pig after all. ? The brisket was tender and fatty in the right places, the pulled pork admittedly dry, and the pork belly with it's strange curled shape and salty, chewy texture was, well, interesting. ?I waited too long and the sausage cooled, by that time it was just spicy. ? Looking down at my slap mess plate, around at the inviting and warmly lit wood tables and fireplace on tv, the friendly personnel, and the olive green parka-ed people around me (who didn't respond to me because I look pretty bad when I wink repeatedly), I am way glad I came here instead of Porky's in Midtown or Oinquerre in Little West 12th Street. ?I figure the giant Buddha and strobe lights would be a distraction to my meal anyway.

This is a place all about meat!! ?You can order ribs, sausage, pork belly, pork cheeks and shoulders, what can't you order pig balls... Out in Williamsburg (yeah the irony.. pig..), you enter what looks like an old english ale bar.. You wait in a line (which remains busy way into the night), and order meat by the pound. ?The place smells of smoke and braised meat. No need to come if you are a vegetarian. ? You select meat from a deli type counter where some dude weighs out your portions with any side dishes. ?The grease and burned pieces flay all over the place. ?You get a big giant silver tray full of meat and sides -hmm the baked beans were delish! ?Definitely include the crunchy pickles, cole slaw and the Key Lime Pie. ?So much food, then take it over to the communal table where you definitely share your seat with an odd mix of people. You can order a jug of ale from the bar (uh, need to wait twice) and lather your meat with a variety of sauces, bbq sauces but wait, you really don't need it. The menu looks like it changes often. ?The pork belly was crispy, yet fatty but delish.. ?The brisket was yummy as well. Yeah, needed to walk back for a couple of miles to be able to breathe.. so glad that you need to walk in NY...

I've lived in Texas and the South and Fette Sau is some pretty damn good barbecue, with the added bonus of being able to drink Brooklyn Lager while eating it. The brisket and the the pork belly are the standouts. (The caramelized fat on the pork belly is reminiscent of all good things in life.) I like the layout, the mechanic shop aesthetic, and the metal tray, pay-by-weight system. The barbecue is about as good as you're going to find in New York, and the no frills presentation is about as close to a Saturday barbecue in Hill Country as you're going to get in New York too. And the bar's got an admirable selection of whiskey and beer too, so there's no rush to leave when dinner's over. Oh yeah, and it's pretty cheap, so it's basically a win-win-win for everyone involved.

since they were out of the chicken and pork belly. my review is limited. I really really enjoyed the brisket - it was fatty, full of flavor, very tender The potato salad was great.

I noticed that many of the 1 star reviews had to do with waiting too long and/or having to fight for a table. ?I didn't have the same experience going there on a Saturday afternoon. ?The place was half empty with little waiting time and plenty of seats available at the communal tables. I found the people working there to be friendly and polite with no attitude whatsoever. ?I also don't mind that the goods were sitting on display. ?At least I can see where the food is coming from. I ordered the brisket and the pulled pork belly. ?Both meats were tasty and juicy but drenched in fat. ?I tilted the tray a little bit and the fat came running down like an avalanche! ?I tried the bbq sauce on the table and I will agree with other folks that it tasted like ketchup with some spices in it. Overall, despite the fat and the somewhat expensive side dishes and beer, I liked this little place tucked in Williamsburg. ?Would I go back? ?On my own, I don't think so. With a group of people, sure. My quest for superb bbq in NYC continues...

A buddy of mine took me here over the summer, as I just started eating meat again. ?We ordered a giant tray of meat and a half gallon of beer and settled in for some delicious BBQ. I dig the low key nature of the place: the beer in jars, self service, long picnic tables (though sorta hate that stuff at the same time), eating off the same tray, ?the faux fireplace. Serendipitously found myself in the same neighborhood over the weekend just as my stomach was growling. Hello brisket and sausage, pulled pork and baked beans. Next time: whiskey flights.

Yeah the BBQ is good - yeah, it's also pricey. ?Beer is reasonable and comes in many different sizes of mason jar/grower combos. ?Really not worth anything beyond a standard glass - doesn't save you anything to upgrade to larger sizes. ? If you buy whiskey here (yes their selection is excellent), you are essentially condoning robbery. ?Plus, like the french, they measure out their liquor, which is infuriating and, in my humble opinion, un-American. ?Rethink that move, guys. ?You are supposed to be a BBQ joint. ?See the irony there?

Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to get there for the main hours of operation - which ends at 11pm. We got there at 10:58 and at least saw the brisket, beans, sausage, pulled pork and short ribs. Mmmmm. We did partake in the late nite menu - $2.50 pulled pork sandwiches! With a tap beer (with the greatest tap handles I've ever seen - made from various knives and medieval looking meat carving tools of carnage), the total was $7.50. R U Kidding? We grabbed our beers, sammiches and 1 of 5 different bbq sauces and headed for the wood benches outside. We had gotten the opportunity to share a couple of beers with head chef, Matt Lang, the previous night at Spuyten Duyvil across the street - and to our surprise, when we sat down, Matt came by, stopped and greeted us. He's a helluva nice guy, which is something you shouldn't take for granted these days. But, my appreciation for Fette Sau grew after meeting Matt. Good food + good people = good. If you can't get in, or don't want to wait in line to get in to Fette Sau during normal dinner hours, my suggestion is to come back at 11pm - the place is much quieter - and get a $2.50 pulled pork sandwich. Amazing.

Beer, bourbon, and barbecue. If you don't like those things, this won't do it for you, but if you do, you are committing a crime against food/libations for not eating here. After living in the south for awhile and eating southern barbecue, I can safely say that this place knows how to do it north of the mason-dixon. We had the pulled pork shoulder and the pork belly, along with chips and the broccoli salad. It was my friend's first time trying pork belly, and I'm glad that I could induct her into the club with such a magical portion. The pork shoulder was so good I could eat it without sauce, but I didn't. I felt like I was in a food coma (of happiness) once I was done. The broccoli salad was a huge portion but good, and the chips were chips. One thing I wish is that the sauces were labeled, because I have no tolerance for spice and burnt my mouth out on the one spicy one. Oops. Also had a delicious beer, though I have no clue what it was and therefore am of no help to anyone else, though I can say for a fact that the selection is excellent, and I'd totally go back for some whiskey bourbon adventures. We sat outside, but there's also ample seating inside as well (and for when the weather turns decidedly wintery.) Truly this is a 4.5 on my scale. I wish they'd deliver to me in Ohio.

I'm always on the look out for fun restaurant options that won't break the bank and are good for groups. As long as you're not hanging out with vegetarians, Fette Sau is a must. I only had one sausage and a roll but it was awesome. You can order drinks also by the mug or pint or gallon jug and I think that's just plain cool. There's tons of beer on tap or Whiskey in reserve. ?Have someone grab a table, the other person order the food, and someone get drinks. Note: the spicy mustard is mad spicy. Beware.

On the outside it may not seem like much but as you walk pass the outside tables full of people laughing and talking, with beers and drinks in hand, surrounding a large platter of smoked meats and sides on a metal tray, it feels truly part of a community event. It's not another restaurant but a place to get together and unwind. Yes, there's a bit of a wait as you queue to the counter - but it helps to see what the day's menu holds and see what people are ordering. Ordered quarter-pound each of the pulled pork shoulder, black angus beef brisket, pork ribs; a small side of baked beans and 1 spicy sausage. 2 bacon brownies to go also. Meal comes with 2 dinner rolls and costs about $20. Pricey? Maybe a little but I had enough food for two or a feast for one. I can't wait to come back again with a group of friends and ordering a bit of the whole menu.

I'm adding to my previous review. ? 4 stars The other day I had a super duper rib craving and went back to Fette Sau. ?I think $8 got me 1/4lb of ribs, which perfectly hit the spot. ?The meat fell right off the bone, just how I like it. ?If you really watch what you order, you won't run up a bill, and the meat's yummy. ?Watch out for the super fatty things though, too fatty for my tastes. 3.5 stars I was leaving Willbeg for a little while and wanted to go out with a bang, so I thought RIBS. ?Decided to try this place, after seeing good ratings. ?The first night we went there was a line out the door, so went elsewhere. ?However, determined to try the place, we went back the next day. My dining partner and I (2 people) tried a little of everything, the 1/4 and 1/2 pound fare didn't seem too pricey. ?We actually did run up a bill. ?I figured it was "organic" "quality" cuts, so it'd be worth it, and I do cite the meat as tasty, however, I couldn't figure out if it was worth it or not. ?It wasn't exactly the greatest dinner afterthought.

Went out to BK on a Sunday as someone had said it's better than Hill Country. It's not. I hate to say it but most Brooklyn restaurants charge 20% less and cater to a younger, less particular crowd. Ever been to Graceland and had serious Memphis 'que? That's what I mean mate. Despite the groovy room, great spirits list and local beer selection, Fette Sau has issues and the meat doesn't have the "wow" factor that a great bbq place should have. The brisket was dry, the coleslaw strange (huge pieces of bell peppers and apple) and two of the three sauces weren't that good. The ribs and the burnt-end beans were alright and all in all, if I lived around the corner, I'd give it a shot again, but as great bbq joints go, this one is serviceable at best.

Holy smokes do I love this place. After living in Texas for 2 years, I really appreciate a good slab of meat. The brisket and berkshire bacon are unbelievable for this side of the mason dixon line. I've tried quite a few different things off their meat and sides menu, and I have never left disappointed. They also have a nice selection of tasty sauces. This could be a good OR bad thing, but I recommend wearing clothes you plan to change out of after dinner. You'll leave smelling like meat- I promise. My only complaint is the slow slow sloooooow service. This sure ain't Texas, where the master meat cutters would have that line moving in no time. Hands down the best Texas BBQ I've had in NY.

At first we saw 'the line' and thought we could do it, but it moved slowly. ?Normally, I would have left, but there is a bar in the place which serves beer/cider (among other things) in pints, quarts, 1/2 gallon (which is what I got), and gallon size. ?So, while the line was moving slowly, at least there are refreshments you can buy while waiting. ?I had consumed half of the 1/2 gallon of my cider just while waiting in line. The smell of mesquite goodness fills the air, but it was surprisingly NOT smokey. ?Everyone was friendly and you could strike up a conversation with anyone about anything. ?It was a friendly laid back atmosphere with some pretty cool tunes. Now, lets get to the meat and potatoes (pun intended). ?Since we were waiting in line for about 45 minutes, the two of us figured to make it well worth it. ?We ordered a pound EACH of pork ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. ?For the sides, we got baked beans and coleslaw. ?They serve this on a big metal tray (which I think is called a quarter pan in the restaurant world). RIBS - The pork ribs were good... but not falling off the bone. ?I don't know if I would wait that long in line just for the ribs, but they were still delicious. PULLED PORK - This was great and putting a little bit of the sweet bbq sauce on it, I made a pulled pork sandwich and was quite happy. BRISKET - Unlike most places, the brisket was not all pulled and put into a pile. ?They served slices that almost resembled prime rib. ?When you went to pick it up, it fell apart (as brisket should). ?A bit greasy, but well worth it. BEANS - These were good, with a unique taste, and not too sweet as most baked beans are. ?I didn't see any little meaty surprise in the beans, but perhaps they randomly put it in. COLESLAW - The was a refreshing palette cleanser and the sauce was neither too vinegary, nor contained too much mayonnaise. ? It was just right. ?The jalapenos were not too spicy, but did add a kick to the slaw. All in all, I'd do it again in a heartbeat. ?I would not go there super-hungry as that might make you cranky while waiting in line. ?After you get your food, there are several picnic tables for you to sit at. ?Just find a spot, sit down, eat, drink, and be merry as tomorrow the cravings for this bbq will be back. I didn't try the pork belly as being a Fette Sau virgin I thought I'd stick to the basics. ?Next time, I will try that as everyone seems to rave about it.

Had a great time here on a Sunday afternoon. You do have to wait in line. I would suggest going with four people. 2 spot a table a squat there while one waits in line and the other gets the drinks at the bar. After dropping off all the drinks. 2 can chill at the table while the other two wait in line. You'll have company and drinks in line or at the table.

A while back, I proclaimed my love for Dinosaur Barbecue. I was young, stupid, and naive. I've found what it TRULY means to be BBQ: Fette Sau. Best BBQ in the City. I mean, it doesn't get much better than a heaping tray of perfectly cooked and seasoned pig and mugs of beer. The pork belly was insaaaane. You'll be rolling out of there when all is said and done. Just be prepared to muscle your way into some table space on the weekends - it's packed!

Seriously the best BBQ joint I have EVER been too. Sure you have to serve yourself and it is in Brooklyn and not the South. Nothing wrong with either though. The food is so flavorful I am salivating just typing this entry. The sides are so so, except for their potato salad. Their brisket is the best! Also beautifully decorated.

My friend and I were walking past and it looked like a really cool bar. ?It's half inside, half outside with a picnic kinda feel. ?Heather (the woman behind the bar) was so nice! ?We chatted her up and she was very friendly, offering free shots and whatnot. ?She introduced us to some locals that frequent the bar. ?So fun!! Didn't try their food, but they had an interesting selection on vintage liquors and beer. ?I personally recommend the cider!

Would be my favorite BBQ joint in NYC, if I lived nearby and the crowds were smaller. Good: PORK BELLY. ?Brisket and ribs were also good. ?Good meat, ordered by weight so you can get exactly what you want. ?Good selection of beers on tap, some I'd never tried before. ?Also have a good whiskey/bourbon selection if I remember correctly. Meh: Pulled pork was only OK. ?Seating is cafeteria-style, with long tables that are claimed by whoever sits down first. ?Makes group dining a pain when it is busy. ?Location isn't great for a Manhattan resident. ?Service is only OK. Bad: ?Ridiculously long lines on weekends. ?A couple Saturdays ago, we actually got tired of waiting and went to a nearby taco place instead. ?Sides are a little overpriced.

Black Angus Brisket that melts in your mouth -- literally. Need I say more? Seating can be a little hectic at times, so try to avoid the peak hours if you're not a fan of standing while you indulge in goodness. And try one of the Whiskey flights. Period.

Let me preface my review by saying if this place were in Texas it wouldn't last a week. I would give maybe three stars. Now that thats out there, Fette Sau is fun, relaxing and delicious. I went on a Thursday night around 9 and it was packed. Not to worry, it took only a few minutes to grab a seat at the bar and begin sampling their handful of really well picked delicious beers on draft. They have a great whiskey collection too... we tried a Hudson that was stellar-- and apparently from New York's first distillery since prohibition. So, informative bartenders give this place an extra half star. We looked over the menu, which was limited as BBQ places usually are, and ordered brisket, pork shoulder, and ribs. The ribs were outstanding. The brisket was a bit dry. The thing that stuck out to me most about this place (as compared to the Texas joints) are their weird BBQ sauces. Let me tell you, a good BBQ sauce can make you forget that your brisket is dry. My dining amigo loved one (but he was from Seattle... what does he know?) but I found it WAY to vinegary. When mixed with the thicker, spicier one it was closer to the real thang, but still not enough to make me forgive and forget. Its always crowded, so don't go if you're looking for an intimate place to have a quiet conversation. You are probably going to have to share a giant picnic table with 15+ people. But hey, thats fun. I will go back to Fette Sau for two reasons. The previously mentioned bar and the delicious broccoli. Thats right, the broccoli. I've never had broccoli melt in my mouth like this. I've also never had broccoli at a BBQ place but thats neither here nor there. It was really garlic-y and had some sort of chili flakes going on. Its THE must-order item.

Fette Sau is deliciousness! This place is great if you're looking to stuff your face with smoked meats and down a few pints of brew. Meat is available fresh daily by the pound. Of note is the pork belly; it's fally, delicious, and melts in your mouth. The brisket is usually good too, and so are the sausages. The pulled pork is decent. Any meal at Fette Sau must include the beans - they're spicy but not too spicy and feature chunks of meat hidden in the sauce! The bar also features a good variety of beers that you can order by the gallon if need be. I hear there is also fine whiskey on hand. There are very few items on the menu that are vegetarian friendly so leave your vegetarian/vegan friends at home for this one. Also, leave your friends on a diet at home too. The places gets pretty packed on the weekends, so go early or go on the weekday. Also, they sometimes run out of meats later on in the evening. So far this is my favorite BBQ place in the five boroughs. I have yet to try all of them, but I do prefer Fette Sau to Dinosaur BBQ.

Do yourself a favor and get here early. They don't take reservations, and when I arrived at 9pm on Friday night there was barely any standing room. Not to mention that you will be relying on the manners and consideration of those already seated. After showing a bit of patience, my party and I were able to find a seat. We sampled just about everything on the menu. The Pork Belly was a delicious guilty pleasure. The ribs looked fantastic (the only thing I didn't try). The sausage was well cooked and spicy. The winners of the night were the Beef Brisket and Pulled pork sausage. They were succulent and cooked to perfection. Add up the food, beer and very reasonable price tag - you can understand why I have given this 5 stars. If you choose to visit Fette Sau, be sure to leave your shy hats at home. You will be seated uncomfortably close to someone you don't know, but if my experience was any indication - everyone is respectful, and pleasant.

We went during the middle of the monsoon this past Saturday. ?We got there just before 5 and were amongst the first to get in. ? The smoky smell hits you as you walk in. ?They only serve 6 meats on any given day and on this day, our choices were: pork belly, pulled pork, brisket, lamb breast (ribs), spicy sausage, beef heart and Cornish hens. ?Being the pigs that we are, the 5 of us ordered a pound each of the brisket, pork belly and lamb breast. ?Add 5 sausage links and sides of beans, pickles, corn bread, sauerkraut and potato salad as well as 2 half gallons of beer, you'd have the cure for any cold, rainy, windy Saturday. The meats were moist and flavorful. ?Brisket is moist and fatty, none of that lean crap at Hill Country or at other places. ?Corn bread was a nice break from all that meat and the beer choices were divine. My issues with Fette Sau are the way they serve. ?One person serving a billion people. ?Not too efficient and led to lines that basically spanned the whole dining room. ? Would definitely go back, but only right at opening or around midnight. The meat..moist and d

Best BBQ in the city, well South Williamsburg, Brooklyn for sure ! Great to meet a group of friends as it's counter service by weight so each person or couple can get their own. This will keep check splitting dilemma out of equation. Trade paying for rounds of growlers instead. Sit @ picnic table out in "courtyard" or at the bar ( tractor seats albeit cool are a torture device-very uncomfortable though). Amazing bourbon selection with tasting flights. Most importantly organic meat !

I had complete confidence Fette would win a perfect score back from me. I just didn't expect it to come from something I had never tried before. I ordered pull pork shoulder, brisket and to change things up beef cheek. The pork is always amazing and the brisket was perfect, I love using the buns to make little sandwiches out of either, of course I douse it in the spicy bbq sauce. The beef cheek was a first and I was blown away. I think it was having every bite with the burnt sides so close together yet the meat remained tender. I am not sure how that's possible, nor do I really care, I just know I need to have more of it.

Meh. SO FATTY. I have traveled all over the South eating BBQ. It's my favorite thing to eat. Why nowhere good to go in Brooklyn, the hotbed of culinary activity? When in Austin I frequent the Salt Lick. In Memphis, more places than I can count and went all around Los Angeles eating BBQ. Even so far as Robin's Woodfire Grill in Hastings Ranch, CA (like 2 hours in LA traffic). I mean, I will go the distance for good BBQ. My boyfriend and I left this place with serious stomach pains. And not the good kind. Greasy, greasy, greasy. The sides, everything. My brisket had HUNKS of fat that I had to cut around. Come on. The whiskey list was great. But the seating style left me elbowing my neighbor while trying to wrestle some fatty meat off the bone of my rack of ribs. Save my life and bring good BBQ to Brooklyn!

Amazing, unpretentious BBQ. Had the pork belly, the pastrami, the cheek, the joul and the pulled pork and everything was amazing. Made the mistake, however, of ordering 1/2 lbs of everything....with fatty meats such as the cheek and the joul especially, a 1/4 lbs is more than enough. Flavor was full, smoky, and delicious. The baked beans were the best I've ever had, and I'm not a huge fan of baked beans to begin with. Collard greens were tasty as well, with bits of meat in them (as they should have). The rolls perfectly complemented everything with their sweet softness; some people complain that there isn't any cornbread but cornbread is more filling than potato rolls and the reason you come here is cause of the meat! You want more stomach space for the BBQ, not the starch! Beers were awesome, atmosphere is fantastic.....laid-back, great music, everyone enjoying eating good food, having a good drink and a good time. Stop bitching about hipsters people, you're in Williamsburg, and they need to eat too. Great whisky bar as well. Come before 7 PM to beat the line.

Best BBQ I have had, period. ?For all of the haters that complain about not having sauce on the BBQ, look on the table. ?There is a sweet sauce as well as a spicy one and a bottle of vinegar if you want sour. ?Mix as you like. We had the holy trinity of BBQ: pulled pork, beef brisket and pork ribs. ?Each had a wonderful bark which not only give you that great smoke flavor (and probably cancer as well, but we wont think about that) it gives a nice crunch texture. ?Yes BBQ does not have to be swimming in sauce, but you can totally dip each piece to your delight. ? It was so good we ordered the boneless beef ribs. ?Fatty, tender and flavorful. ?You can cut the meat with a fork. ? The baked beans are sweet with chunks of pulled pork--a perfect side. ? This is a no nonsense place. ?Yes there is communal seating, but it's BBQ. ?Get to know your neighbors, it adds to the experience. Perfect.

I've eaten in a bunch of bbq places here in the city... this place was somewhat disappointing for me. First the good news... wasn't too expensive, and you can easily get filled up here. Now, the bad news... first off, NO sweet tea? Huh?? Gotta have sweet tea with bbq imo, doesn't matter what region you're supposed to be emulating. Communal seating... sigh... perhaps that works when you're just outta college or something, but if you're a litle older, have paid your dues, and have a bit of success in life, you appreciate a table, at least a waiter/waitress for drink service, and perhaps someone to clean up your plate/tray afterwards? Just my opinions... Now food wise... we tried the pork belly, pork ribs, boneless beef ribs and the pulled pork. All were ok. Nothing spectacular. Very frankly, i'd MUCH rather have hill country's chicken and brisket hands down. I didn't try any of the side dishes... they were NOT noted clearly on a blackboard. Again, just my opinion, but, the wait was rather long for food, the drinks and the side dishes were not clearly listed anywhwere, there are a whole lot more minuses than positives for this place. I gave it two stars because it wasn't bad, but the experience as a whole leaves one wanting. Oh, yeah... it's been 3 hours since i've eaten there... and I didn't fill up, yet... the grit is still in my teeth as is the flavor... again, imo, that's not a good thing... don't have that issue with any place else i've tried decent bbq at here in NYC.

This place is pretty much a spot I have to hit when ever I go to BK. This is absolutely a win win; BBQ goodness thrown on a metal plate, plus great beer. Great hangover food or even good food to start the night but go light or you might get the bubble guts while out. This was my first experience after eating over a pound of meat (pause). This place gets pretty crowded at night so two suggestions get there early and go in a small group. The price is really good and it's usually about 40-50 bucks for 3-4 people, based on the appetite of who you're with. I'm hoping to get to NYC in March or April just to hit this up again. Stuff to get:: Pork belly Brisket Pastrami Sausage (Pause) Pickles (Pause) To drink: No brainer, Brooklyn Lager Their special BBQ Sauce

So I hate to give this place 3 stars, I'll think about changing my mind later, but it must be done. There were definitely things I enjoyed here; the bacon was excellent, the brisket was tasty, the sausage was nice, you can try a variety of meats, they had good cider, and the decor ambiance was nice. But the things I didn't like brought it down: You have to admit the place is pricey, which would be ok if it weren't for the faux pas. To start, the beans were a hot vinegary? mess. $5.25 for their small size of these beans is a shame. I'm going to pretend they made an error. I think it's pretty known that a bbq place is judged just as much for it's sides. Am I right? They had no macaroni & cheese which I'm not figuring into the rating, but I think that's an error as well. And lastly, because the meat is priced by the pound, I would have hoped they would lower the price of the pork ribs. Since you know, there are huge bones in there. I guess not. The per pound thing sounds like a good idea until your tray looks like a pig/cow checked off the organ donation box. You end up with a bunch of small portions and you've paid $30 At any rate, its a nice place to try, but just be prepared that when you're "trying" the different meats here, ?you will be paying the price for it.

Love this place. The meat is exceptionally well cooked, and they always have a few different cuts to try that you've probably never experienced before. The line takes a long time, but you can get drinks while you're waiting in it. The rump roast was super fatty, and just amazingly delicious, must've been so slow cooked it was almost as if it had been done sous-vide, could literally cut it with a fork. The brisket was also very good, a bit thicker fat than the fully marbled that I prefer. The pulled pork was excellent, although definitely needed the sauce. The pork jowl was the only thing that was a bit disappointing. It was good, it just (of course) wasn't as fatty a cut as some of the other meat, so not nearly as moist. The sides were also very good: the baked beans were among the best I've had, sweet but with a spicy kick. The cole slaw was cut extremely thick, almost to the point of being a salad rather than traditional cole slaw, but very tasty. The potato salad had large chunks of skin-on potato, so not as mayonnaise intensive, but still very good.

Gotta say, best brisket ever, and the burnt ends baked beans were up there on my list of amazing things to eat. Ribs were delsih, and loved the selection of bbq sauces on the table, particularly the hot one. Sausage was so-so. Why only 3 stars? Just shocked that without alcohol, the food for three of us cost $75, and we were not stuffed. Maybe I should just take into account the hipster effect as a reason why it was so pricey, but maybe cause I'm not a hipster,I felt a bit ripped off!

I'll never pass up a chance to go to Fette Sau. Everything I've had there is incredible. High quality meat cooked slowly and lovingly. Half of the dinner conversation is always about how good it is. You have to wait in line, and it can get pricey, but it's totally worth it for amazing outdoor BBQ, especially in hot weather.

Fantasmatastic-meat-fest! The guy servin up the pork is happy to help you out with a variety plate of all the lovely options. Don't bother with the sides, you won't have room for them with all the meat you'll be eating. Amazing menu full of bourbon - having only american spirits I thought was a nice touch - you won't find any scotch here. The only problems? ?Crowded and seating shoved in with others - tap water comes with disturbing milky foam, and for some strange bizarre reason, no salt shakers in the place?? But these things won't distract much from the carnivorous delights you are experiencing. I'm told when they have lamb, which is rare, make sure to get some.

Good value, casual but inviting setting, interesting beers, bourbon drinker's dream come true. For complete info, read the NY Times online review. That describes the experience better than any other. My summary: Meats sold by the pound, on a tray, with no table service. Talk to the meat carver and ask for whatever you want, as much or as little as you want. If you want to taste a little of everything, ask. If you want to only spend about $10, say so. Very accommodating. Sauces aren't the highlight. Beers available in several different sized jars, good for half-pint drinkers.

Holy God! I'm glad I don't live around the corner from this place. Okay, I'm from Texas and it is the best BBQ I've ever had. When I was living in Texas last year, I visited my other fellow Texans living in Brooklyn and they took me here. I returned to Texas very pissed off because my friends were not only living in New York, they were eating the best BBQ in the country as well! I just moved to Brooklyn myself and was very eager to return here. They delivered once again. This place makes the idea of being a vegetarian impossible and affirms the notion that human beings are supposed to eat meat! Wow! I don't feel the need to say anything further, just go for yourself (Pssp..great beer on tap)!

Total carnage. One wall is illustrated with different cuts of meat, carefully labeled "Shank" and "Cushion Shoulder". The taps at the bar are made from rusty, old meat cleavers. The brisket was out of this world as was the potato salad. And the bartender was very helpful in picking out an amazing Pennsylvania Hirsch bourbon. I also tried my friend's more traditional Kentucky-born Black Maple Hill bourbon... pretty tasty, but a little on the light side.. and i could do without the tele-fire... just sayin' but whenever i am feeling pork/biscuit/whiskey deficient I know how to cure what ails me.

I love this place. There is outdoor seating, great food and beer. Went twice in a day, since the Knitting Factory is across the street. I highly recommend the pork belly, but really everything was a great, and reasonably priced. Loves all the sides, especially the potato salad. The espresso soda was kind of interesting, almost like a bubbly sweet Americano. Last, they have several selections of beer that you can also take home in a jug (extra $4). They serve half pints and full pints in mason jars. If you like whiskey, they have combo selections.

Great BBQ in the Williamsburg area. You enter this mid-sized restaurant and the first good sign is the smell of smoke that hits you (it isn't overwhelming and you don't leave the place smelling like tar, which has happened at some BBQ places I've been to). You choose from their various meats and they are weighed by the pound. What we did was try a quarter pound of several different meats, and they were all very good. The brisket was fatty and tender enough. The pork ribs were tasty as well. My general criticism of the meat, however, would be that I've had meat that is more tender at other restaurants. The pork ribs were great, but they also weren't exactly falling off the bone. The brisket was mouth-watering, but it didn't fall apart in your mouth. Anyway, long story made short, go here for probably the best BBQ in Williamsburg and perhaps Brooklyn too.

So, I'm from Texas. And that isn't to say "Y'all, I'm from Texas, so listen here what I got to say 'bout this here Fat Soo." Point is, I've had good barbecue, and this is some of the best I've ever had. I've read some of the various complaints (you'll always find some regardless of the quality of an establishment), but many of them seem unfounded. Some say the meat is too fatty. Well, it's barbecue folks. Expect a bit of fat. The brisket here is undoubtedly the juiciest, most melt-in-your-mouth brisket I've ever had. I mean, the slab jiggles when he's cutting it. The pulled pork is delicious and makes a great sandwich with their delicious rolls. The sweet sauce is my sauce of choice and makes a great compliment to it all. I dare anyone to find more savory brisket anywhere. I usually tack on some sausage as well, which is very well flavored. I've heard some complaints about the ribs being dry but I'm not a rib guy for the most part. The beers are great. The sides menu could use a bit more action but I come for the meat. I give it 5 stars for the brisket alone. It's a revelation.

This was my second visit, I don't generally write a review based on a single visit as people can have off days and I value consistency. I arrived and saw that Thursdays is pig day, meaning that each Thursday they pick a pig from a different farm and sell all the various parts that day. I got 1/2 # of pulled pork, two sausages, and tried some pork rind. Also got a 1/2 gallon of cider and some pickles. All the food was really good, and I like that they use Martin's Potato rolls (which get thrown in for free). The sides are a bit over priced ($3 for just 4 pickles), but I liked the fact that you can get up to a gallon of brew or cider to take out. Keep in mind that this is not a place to sit down and be waited on. You go in and choose what you want and how much of it you want from the meat counter. Then pay and find a seat at one of the long communal tables or take it to go. They do deliver, but where I was ultimately headed was sadly out of their delivery range.

Great BBQ for NY. I've eaten BBQ in St. Louis, Houston and the South East so I feel that I know what I should look for but at the end of the day the meat was tender and juicy. The food really tasted great and you didn't need the bbq sauce which I didn't even try. I can say with the utmost confidence that NY is not known for it's bbq joints because of the sincere lack of true bbq fans it seems. NY is populated with bad chains and this restaurant though it has its faults, is very good. The food was great. Beef Ribs were excellent. Pork Ribs were spot on. Brisket was the star of the show(I am biased towards that cut of bbq.) Links were pretty good but not great(too much fennel and no spice). Baked beans were the best baked beans I have ever had(not too sweet and not too much vinegar.) German potato salad wasn't great. The potato chips were surprisingly good. The cokes in glass bottles were a great touch. The problems with this establishment are standard to most "Williamsburg" spots. I am from NY, born and raised. This area was always known to me as a bad neighborhood which I have experienced in the late 80's and early 90's and now this town is the hot spot which still seems crazy to me. Now back to the restaurant, not enough seats because BBQ is trendy among skinny people(doesn't make sense) and the prices are astronomical for poor people food(bbq consists of cuts of meat that nobody wanted.) Very Expensive bbq with picnic tables. Overall Great food and will be about $35-$45 per person.

Been there a number of times with a number of friends.....we all leave satisfied....food is amazing but the line sucks.....but at least you can wait and drink beer or a whisky from their large selection; they sell the beers in ?jugs so you can keep refilling your self up. ?The two types of people that dominate that seen is not for me....but that is irrelevant because the food is amazing. ? I have had the sausages: pretty good I have had the brisket: amazing I have had the st louis type ribs: amazing I have had the House Cured Pastrami: amazing Side dishes are weak though....but everything else makes up for that....... Highly recommend.

This place will make a vegan eat meat! ?I love it. ? And this is saying a lot as I have a passion for bbq and have traveled through the US in search of great bbq. ?My favorite is Salt Lick near Austin, TX and Fette Sau. My husband and I have eaten there over a dozen times and have had everything you can imagine. ?My favorites are the Burnt end baked beans, ribs, pulled pork and cheeks. ?You really can't go wrong. ?The menu is different every day and the place does get busy - so get there early - because they do tend to run out of stuff. ?Sometime you have to wait 45 minutes or longer to get your meat. ?This is a great place to take out of town guests, we have done it several times and each time it was a great experience.

I get the feeling some of the reviewers here are trying to outcool themselves by putting this place down. "allen c" says the place is "welcome to Bedford," whatever that means. But I clicked his profile and see he gave Dunkin' Donuts 4 stars. 4 stars! and he gave Fette Sau 3? Oh come on, now. I went to this place last night and was blown away. If you want some great BBQ, in a creative, interesting spot, you should go. I should also mention that the music is great, and at the perfect volume. I suspect these guys are geniuses.

I wanted to give you five stars Fette Sau but I just couldn't do it. Maybe the next time I go back they will have the sausage and pork belly which seem to be favorites but on this occasion they didn't. Let me start by saying the decor/ambiance is awesome, I don't know how this will change in the cold weather but I went two weeks ago on a mild Saturday evening and we sat outside at the picnic tables. The bar is great with the butcher tool taps and the John Deere tractor seats for stools. Good beer selection and even though I'm not a whiskey drinker I appreciate their selection. I like the method of ordering by weight cafeteria style and opted for the huge lamb shank, flank steak, and pork cheeks and chose potato salad and baked beans for sides. I also had the opportunity to try my friends pork chop. Lamb Shank- This thing was huge and had a good lamb and smoke flavor but was a bit dry and fatty, with a good amount of vinegar sauce it was enjoyable. Flank Steak- really top notch. Very rare, so juicy and tender it just melted in your mouth Pork Cheeks- needed to get sauced up bigtime! These little pork nuggets were really dry and a bit chewy Pork Chop- this was delicious, it was tender, moist, and had great smokey flavor Baked Beans- sweet, with a little heat in the background and pieces of brisket in it really tasty but a bit sweeter than I would have liked Potato Salad- they go German with the potato salad which is fine by me! Potatoes are al dente and nice sweet and sour flavor with bacon in the background, could have used a little less dressing but would get it again anyway All in all Fette Sau is worth the trip to Williamsburg. Make a day of it and have a few beers at Brooklyn Brewery and do some hipster watching. Don't plan on a night of drinking afterward though because you will be STUFFED!

Have you ever eaten so much of something you got sick but couldn't stop because it's THAT good? This place is like that. I live behind it, and every once and awhile, a breeze sends the delicious scents of bbq through my window. Believe me, I don't mind. It's like having random little nasal orgasms. Yeah, you read that right. NASAL ORGASMS. The only thing I'm not a big fan of are those silly rolls and some of the sides don't really tickle my fancy. But I could eat their BBQ FOREVERRRRR (I'm never buying a grill.)

That being said, definitely worth visiting.

I'd passed this place many times thinking it was just a ?pretentious Euro-cafe..until.. I wondered in on a drunken biking bar/food crawl with a then friend who was cheating on her girlfriend by pretending to date me. [Not as complicated as it sounds.] ? The decor is most amazingly like an awesome stoner uncles back yard..but roofed. Pic-nic tables and beer served in mason jars. The food is served by weight on a tray which is just slapped on by the lunch lady line. I don't remember there being utensils. I was already drunk mind you. I loved the optional mason jar sizes of a fantastic Germanic beer selection up to a gallon even! With jar & tray in hand. You plop right down next drunken sauce slathered strangers blissed out on sloppy food. Great date place. [If your date is already drunk and doesn't mind MEATS.]

Excellent barbeque, with a good amount of choices. The patient soul behind the counter barely even flinched when I asked for a quarter pound of whatever meats they had. He carefully measured and wrapped everything to go, threw in a bunch of sauces, and we were on our way to meaty paradise. For the record, we got to try the beef ribs, the pork ribs, the pork belly, the brisket, pork belly, pulled pork, and hot sausages. Everything was smoky and tender. I know that they have slightly different choices every day, but from what I tried, everything was a winner.

I really cannot think of anything bad about this place. I recently moved to Williamsburg back in December and have a select few favorite spots, and Fette Sau is one of them. First of all, I am not even a big meat eater and I love this place! I usually get the pulled pork with a potato salad side and pickle. The bbq sauces are awesome and beer selection- great. Best part may be the atmosphere and the way it i served. Ordering meat by the pound, my boyfriend loves. You get a slab of meat and food on a tray, a jug of beer and then go feast. Always go hungry- even if you don't want to eat a lot, you always end up leaving and feeling like a gluten. So good. Great crowd. Good service. Great food. Even for the non meat enthusiast- it is worth a go.

I'm going to mark this down as the best BBQ in Brooklyn. ?A varied selection of cuts that depend on when you come round and a nice selection of sides makes things interesting. ?The slaw, pickles, and beans are my favorite sides. ?I haven't had a bad bite there yet. Table service isn't the thing here, so if you are looking for something like that, this isn't the place for you. ?Meat is served cafeteria style, by the pound (you can ask for halves and quarters as well) and doled out on your own personal tray. ?Finding a seat can be a little challenging depending on how heavy the crowd is, but I haven't had much of a problem. If all else fails, you can always do take-out.

When I eat barbecue, I look for a few things: does the meat fall off the bone; can you eat it without a sauce; how was it cooked? ?My first test was a shoulder sandwich. ?I tasted the shoulder sans sauce; it was ok-slightly dry. ?Sliced a roll in half, lathered on the tomato based BBQ sauce, layered on shoulder and coleslaw (from the sides menu) and WHAM! that sandwich was out- of -this -world! ?Of course, I knew the sauce made the sandwich the king that it was- tangy, spicy, just enough tomato to not overpower the sauce. ?I tried to slip out with the bottle. ? Next I tried the St. Louis rib-again the rib was slow cooked in an oven. ?At first bite, the meat fell off of the bone almost immediately in one hunk. ?However, this is where disappointment set in, the meat was chewy-it did not melt in my mouth immediately, it was almost a little too tough. Note about cooking ribs (or any kind of BBQ for that matter): these types of meats are meant to be cooked over an indirect flame for many hours the average cooking time lasting about 24 hours. ?When you have a properly smoked rib, your meat will have a nice gray tint to it when you bite in. ?Fette Sau's meat did not. ?It was pinker in the center, which means it's been cooked too fast. ?However, again, slather on that tomato based sauce (yes, skip that North Carolina vinegar based sauce) and dig in! The brisket-I had a small bite of the brisket-it was my least favorite, slightly dry and tough to chew. The sides: skip the oil/vinegar/garlic broccoli salad (unless you are warding off vampires) and also skip the baked beans (the beans were not typical southern barbecue baked beans), and order the oil and vinegar based coleslaw (although I wish it was chopped finer rather than being served in big hunks) as your side-it will be the perfect accompaniment for your new favorite BBQ sandwich. One thing I did notice is that no one tried the sauce. ?The patrons sitting next to me were dotting sauce on their tray and dipping teeny pieces of meat into the tiniest dot of sauce. ?It's barbecue people, get messy and SLATHER it on! To complete your Fette Sau experience, order Mason jars (or jugs) of some of the craft beer on tap. ?You just may want to start square dancing after your Fette Sau experience. ?Yee-haw!

The sides of the brisket was burned a little the way a like it, the taste was amazing! ?I like the BBQ sauce which is big for me to enjoy the food. ?What I thought was equally amazing was the beans. ?I don't like baked beans. ?These baked beans were amazing!

Wow tried the top rated bbq joint in brooklyn and can do better in my own kitchen. Tried the brisket and greasy duck...was not impressed. 1st off the line was out the door and down the walk...so i was thinking yeh baby this has gotta be the best. Serving style was different wax paper and surgical trays o.k. cool and funky. Picnic tables that you have to fight to get a seat no wonder when we pulled up some guy was eating in his car...So as far as the food was concerned the best thing on both our plates came in a bag(the chips). Don't believe the hype.

I had some of all the pork dishes. I thought the ribs were fantastic and definitely the highlight although not by much over the pork belly and pulled pork. Even the sides of baked beans and coleslaw (which was given to my by the lady behind the counter) was great. ?Beer selection was great as well. The downside to the place is the line takes forever to move. I was here on a tuesday night and there's only one guy (not dissin' him at all) who cuts up the meat and takes orders from walk ins and by phone it seems and the other thing is you end up smelling like bbq smoke at the end of your meal. Oh, I don't know if i agree with the people who come in groups and have one group member table save while the others wait in line. It seriously takes so long in the line that 3 people in front of you could have eaten and left before you get to the seat. Leave it to first come first served.

A friend of mine brought me to this place earlier today. We were both hungover and needed some grease in our bellies. I thought the name of the place was Fat Sal's. LoL. The food was freaken awesome! Lots of grease and great tasting fat! The meat was so juicy it could've been called Tropicana. I didn't like one of the spices in the potatoes and bacon but it was still good. Stuffed my face so much I was sweating like Mike Tyson at a spelling bee. Worth the ride over there while hungover and even worth dealing with the hipsters.

Disclaimer: I have lived in Kansas City and am considering the BBQ I have eaten there in this rating. ?If only considering NYC, this place is 4 stars. Fette Sau is actually the best BBQ I've had in NYC. ?In general, its pretty darn good. ?Doesn't compare to the better places in Texas and KC, but it does hold up well against the average place in those cities. The problem with Fette Sau is that the sides suck. ?There isn't a single side on the menu that I've really liked. ?Its so weird. ?Why can't they put a bit of effort into their sides. The other negative is that this place is always packed and its always a fight to find seating. That said, this IS my favorite BBQ spot in NYC, the problem is that we just don't have great BBQ spots in NYC.

gggggggggahh. its like this place took everything i love in life, caught it and hog-tied it on a spit. fette sau - my friends, is a M.E.A.T Party: Men. Eating. Animals. Together. scene: rustic. wood. banquet tables. need i say anything else? the people are chillin', cause they about to get their caveman on. no one is here to be douche-y or scene-y, rather just to sink their faces in some animal. food: get a little of everything - pulled pork, brisket, pork belly, RIBS! i think we also got the crispy pork tail to be humorous, was more tough than i hoped. they also have a wonderful selection of sides. brocolli salad, coleslaw, rolls, and the delicious baked beans. eat in or take out. they wrap everything up in cute little brown paper packages (if only they could tie them in string..tee-hee) SO CHARMING - i die! they also have a series of sauces in bottles on said banquet tables, and huge rolls of paper towels. overall a lovely spot and i am completely charmed by this joint. go, experience, and enjoy.

Your not really going to find another place like this. When I come here I feel like I am at home. I get sloppy and eat with my hands. (along with most others there) Honestly real good BBQ food and I recommend it to people who like stuff like this. There's a bar in the place so that's a plus. Sat is mostly packed depending on the time you go. I would go either during the week but Friday and Sat go early.

Interesting experience and decent food. We must have arrived at a perfect time because the line was not super long. It took about 30 minutes for us to get in the counter and get served. I didn't want to be in charge of selecting the food since the meat was ordered per weight. So, I left the ordering to the guys. ?Surprisingly, they ordered just the right amount of food. ?Their selections were: pork belly, brisket, pork & beef ribs. Both ribs were tender. The brisket was flavorful. I didn't think the meat needed the sauce on the side. I was disappointed with the pork belly. I didn't enjoy chewing all the fat. After consuming all the meat, I surely felt my LDL level rise. The sides we tried were: coleslaw, baked beans, and pickles. I enjoyed all the sides. Each were seasoned and cooked pretty well.

As a born-again meatatarian, this place has been super high on my list. ?However, getting people (myself included) to Brooklyn is a stretch, and in winter, nearly impossible. Add this to the fact that the line for Fette Sau usually extends outdoors. ?But since hearing co-workers and basically every Man-type who's ever eaten here rave that it's the best BBQ ever, I had to come up with a reason to go. ?So this weekend, when the bf's frat bros were in town, I suggested we make the trek for some good meat... ? The experience may have been different, had it not been a random spring day in January, but the wait (~1:30 hr) didn't seem too bad. ?Since they let you drink in line, the increasing drunkenness of the people around you provides for some decent entertainment. ?Once we got to the counter, we ordered basically everything they had left...Sausage, pulled pork, brisket, and pork belly plus beans, potato salad, cole slaw, and pickles. ? The meat was really great. ?Since coming back to meat, it's taken me a little longer to get back to pig things, but the pork belly and all it's fatty awesomeness was basically heaven. ?In fact, that and the pulled pork were far and away my favorite things. ?I don't know about the prep process of either, but I think it's complicated and they nailed it. On the downside, I'm a sides and condiments type of person, and those left something to be desired. ?The beans were good, and Guss's pickles are pickles, and I like pickles, but otherwise I had higher hopes for some meat compliments. ?That said, the meat was fantastic. ?We scarfed our trays in about 10 minutes, and then, since it was around 10 already, we got another growler and hung out til after 11. ? While from a meat-only perspective, I can't think of any bbq I've had that's better, I think it will be a while until I make the trek again. ?They could dial up the sides a bit, and try to find some more efficient way of assigning seating. ?I understand the wait-in-line, find a seat concept, but circling tables like a vulture and stink-eyeing people with empty trays (and no drinks) until they get up, is not my favorite thing to do right before a feast. ? Though once seated, and assuming you've got plenty of everything made with animal, the experience is really great.

This is the best BBQ I have ever had in my entire life. The pork cheek was to die for. I can't stop thinking about it. The beans, potato salad and pickles were a nice addition to the mountain of meat we had before us: pulled pork, ribs, belly and cheeks. I also really liked the deli ordering style where you can get as much or as little of something as you like. They sell everything by the pound. This allowed me to try everything without feeling like I was missing out by choosing an entree with pre-fixed sides. Great beer and bourbon selections with family style first come first served seating.

Beer was good. The pulled pork sandwich was good ( showed up there for bar menu only). Service was terrible. The bartender couldn't answer any questions about the beer or the whiskey and just kept saying everything was "north american". Any question we asked, she would say " It's all on the menu". And then when we commented on her being rude, she said that it was just loud and she couldnt really hear. And as for the sandwich, it was good, but they couldn't even put the meat into the sandwich. They threw it into one of those paper plates and put the bun on the top. The place has a cool atmosphere, and I would go there again, but to try the full menu and some more beer. But still two stars.

I still am a tremendous fan of Fette Sau. I don't need white table cloths with my bbq. ?Came back a second time to heap my punishment on my figure. ? I was dying to try the pork belly and I have heard so much raving about it from so many others. ?So BF and I got a half pound of pork belly, a half pound of pulled pork and a couple of ribs. The ribs was as I remember (fantastic). no saucy mess needed with these ribs. ? The pork belly was really fatty and good and guilt inducing. But a little goes a long way and after a 1/4 lb each for bf and I we were both screaming no mas. ? The body didn't appreciate that assault the next day, but it would in no way deter me from pigging out there again. Maybe just scale back on the pure fat.

Lines, Lines, Lines. ?Be prepared to stand in line (esp on weekends). ?But, oh, is the wait worth it. ?Don't be embarrassed to order just a little bit of everything, but make sure you order a lot of the brisket. ?Best ever, in my opinion. The feeling of community runs deep here as well. ?It begins when you queue up 30 deep to order. ?Then, as you hover, holding a tray of sweet smelling, carbon charred goodness, waiting for a spot at the picnic tables to open up, you can eye up your communal competition for the open seat. It's all good fun and even better atmosphere. ?The best barbeque I've ever had only makes it better.

I dont claim to be a BBQ aficionado, I just know when a lot of care is put into the food I eat. ?My friends on the other hand, are from Charleston, and they said it was the best BBQ they've had in the NY area yet... 1) ?We let the BBQ people order. One person waited for a table which involves camping in front of a table. One person got the beer, which by the way comes in 1/2 Liter and 1 Liter bottles if desired. 2) Didnt like the sauce. One spicy, one ketchup based which tasted like only ketchup, and one who knows WTF that was, clearly not my taste. Perhaps we had a bad batch, but universally didnt like it. 3) What we got. a) Berkshire Pork belly-that was ridiculously fatty...too rich for some people's liking... b) Berkshire cheeks-the rub was absolutely amazing, and the meat had this great sweetness...my BBQ friends said "we usually dont care what part of the pig it comes from as long as it's meat" c)Pulled pork-so smoky with a great texture d) Sausages-these were more on the sweeter side Sides-My friends from the south wish there were more authentic sides.. 1) PIckled asian slaw- actually quite good, though obviously their own creation 2) Some Broccoli salad that was surprisingly good... We exited out, loosened the belt, and headed to the beer garden at the back of Spuyten Duyvil across the street!

you will probably have to wait on line, but this will give you time to peruse your options. All meat is available by the pound. My top choices are the boneless beef ribs and the pulled pork shoulder. Keep in mind that bone will add alot of weight to your order (eg. pork rib). Fette Sau has an excellent beer selection. i usually go with Liguid Gold (available by the pitcher). The head bbq/grillman/chef was featured and beat the competition on a food network challenge. service is very helpful and under pressure, so ask them questions right away instead of staring blankly at the options and stuttering. enjoy!

The meat was slow cooked and full of flavor. It is served deli style (you tell them what/how much you want) and the meat was practically falling apart as the counterperson pulled up hunks of it. I tried the beef brisket and pork belly. The brisket was peppery and spicy with a nice crunch on the outside. The pork belly was super tender and flavorful, and practically melted in your mouth. You can get a table inside or a picnic-style bench outside. Amazing dinner experience, but not quite 5 stars. Don't fret, Fette Sau, 4 stars is really good too =)

After reading so many excellent reviews, I had pretty high expectations for this place. First thing you notice is overwhelmingly delicious smell of smoked BBQ even before you walk in the door. The menu is pretty simple so it isn't very hard to decide what you want to eat. Ribs, brisket, or pulled pork. The meats were just ok and the sides were extraordinarily rich. I paid $18 for two small orders of meat and a side of macaroni. This place seems to have a cult following but I'm not quite sure why.

This is the best BBQ I've had without a doubt. ?I've been to quite a few great BBQ establishments across the country, this one takes the cake and lucky for me its only about a 40 min drive. ?Meat is ordered by the pound on what looks like prison cafeteria trays (once you've had it you would gladly commit a felony if prison food were this good) and the sides are all great. ?There are about 4 or 5 different sauces but the main one(large bottle) is to die for, it can be put on anything under the sun to make it taste good. ?Another awesome thing is that they usually have something different in the meat department every time you go. ?When you finally get to the register to order it is like public speaking as you tend to panic on what to choose and your palms get sweaty. ?The servers are all very friendly and knowledgeable about the products so you don't have to be scared. ?The one problem is that if you go on the weekend there is usually about an hour wait but that gives you time to take down a growler of microbrewed beer while in line so all is well. ?All in all I would recommend this place for anyone that is into great BBQ/beer selection (not too many people aren't into that kind of thing). PS: ?When ordering go for a 1/4 pound of everything so that you get a little taste of all the meats to decide what you like for future visits. ?Also, if you go with a couple people you should each order a different side order so that they all can be shared amongst the table. ?Prost!

Simply sensational BBQ! ?There was not an item that we tried which wasn't outstanding. The Ribs were perfectly seasoned and smoked, with a nice pull off the bone. ?They were meaty and delicious. The pork belly was as good a rendition as I've ever tried. ?Smoked to perfection while retaining a perfect moistness. ?The same can be said for the brisket. The pulled pork, while very good, was the weakest of what we tried. ?This is not to bash the pulled pork, but rather to state just how exceptional the ribs, brisket and pork belly were. ?If I came and had only the pulled pork, I'd have been happy. ?The other 3 were simply highlights. Last night they offered sirloin. ?A meat I've never tried off the smoker, the sirloin was flavorful and delicious. ?Not sure I'd order ahead of the aforementioned items, but certainly well-done and quite delicious. Even the baked beans were exceptional. ?Nicely seasoned, in a delicious BBQ sauce, with burnt ends in the mix. ?I'm a huge baked beans fan, and this was as good a rendition as I've ever sampled. I am not a huge coleslaw person, as I'm not big on mayo. ?That being said, they are serving a vinegar based slaw that is simply delicious. ?Not soggy or wilted, but served crisp and vibrant. ?Almost like an Asian style slaw. Their beer and whiskey selection is outrageous, and they have a fun selection of sodas. They do not accept reservations. ?It's first come first serve. ?They have a selection of tables. ?Half are inside, half are outdoors. ?Upon arriving, there is a line that everyone waits on. ?When you get to the front of the line, you place your order, and it is served just about immediately. ?All food (except for sides) is ordered by pound. ?Make sure you order enough food, as you will NOT want to wait on line again. ?The wait can be as long as 2 hours. After ordering and ?receiving your food, you will then bring your food to an open spot at a table. ?If you're smart, as you get towards the front of the line, you have a portion of your party scope out some seats--which ?open up as people leave when they've finished eating. ?If you are a party of two, finding a spot should be of little problem. ?Larger parties would be wise to reserve a space just prior to ordering. All drinks are served at the bar. ?Food and drink are completely separate--both in ordering and billing. ?The bar is not so crowded. ?Getting a drink--alcoholic or otherwise is not difficult. ?The nice thing about this is that you can enjoy a drink while waiting on line. This is definitely an establishment to patronize during nicer weather. ?Cold or rain can potentially eliminate half of the seating. Overall, this place is serving up some of the finest BBQ in the NYC area. ?I think 5 stars may be too much. ?I'd like YELP to offer a half star option, as I'd really like to give 4 1/2 stars. ?Definitely a place to which I'd like to return.

8 PM on a cold Saturday night... packed as hell. Seating was a bit tight since it is family style as everyone here has mentioned. Employees (bus boys? idk what to call them) were pretty swift and cleaned up the empty trays. Be warned that people will "camp" your seat. It was kind of awkward with people just standing behind you... waiting. The food, however, was AWESOME. I was really worried about the hype and tried to lower my expectations. But Fette Sau delivered on their BBQ. Succulent and juicy hunks of meat plopped on basically what looks like a 9 x 13 baker's sheet. This totally brings out the innate barbaric instincts of our ancestors. LOL Sides and bread are plain. But that's expected... BBQ is the star! 3 STARS for experience on lines and seating 5 STARS for the BBQ So I give this 4 stars. ?Will definitely go again even if it is packed.

If you love BBQ, craft ales, and good whiskeys, get ready to go to heaven at Fette Sau. I am a bbq aficionado, and this is very fine bbq by any standard. And it is no accident because it is made in the finest artisanal style with the finest ingredients. It ain't cheap, but berkshire pork and wagyu beef aren't cheap either, and buying meat from folks who care about humane treatment and sustainability costs more than Smithfield or IBP or Perdue. Drive by one of their processing facilities and write to me about how much you want their food. Then go to one of the farms that supplies Fette Sau and see the difference. But the great food alone doesn't get 5 stars, and I am not rating on social conscience here, but when you serve great craft ales and whiskeys at fair prices to do homage to the bbq, then you are not just right in the pantheon of gastro-ecstacy, but among the upper crust. And please do some whiskey pairing with the bbq. Most folks don't realize that there are many foods which are great with spirits, and whiskey and bbq are a fine match.

if mediocre were a food, then you can find it all on the menu here at fette sau. the meats are generally OK, though i will admit a fondness for the spicy sausages (not a euphemism for anything), but i don't believe they're made in house but instead, bought in. so that's not really deserving of any credit other than, good job at finding an awesome sausage supplier. what really rankles my chain are the sides offered here: - greyish yellow broccoli 'salad' that tastes heavily of vinegar and takes an already maligned vegetable (which i happen to love) and turns it into something even more loathed - potato salad: are you kidding me with this crap? - mama zuma's potato chips, billed as "super spicy" or some junk but they're about as incendiary as a kitten taking a nap. yawn - baked beans: nothing particularly exciting i do enjoy the half sour pickles, but you'd have to really be a total fuck up to mess up a pickle. good selection of whiskey to drown your disappointment though.

piggy, piggy, pig, oink, oink. excuse me sir, you want pig with that? so if you've already read my Beer review, you know i was probably in no shape to really appreciate the piggy goodness of Fette Sau but here goes. ? first off, don't order food here (or anywhere, for the matter) when you are drunk and hungry. ?Bad news. ?Ins spite of the ridonkulous price tag, here goes.... first, i ordered half a rack of ribs, a side of baked beans, and another side of broccoli salad. ?refer to previous paragraph. ?the ribs were absolutely fantastic, the baked beans were.... oh my g*d, i think i just made a mess..... good. ?i mean GOOD. ?with bits of pulled pork mixed into them. ?ok, i have to stop. the broccoli salad was cold. ?nuff said. i don' really remember much more than that, other than using a roll of paper towel and Jon pointing out that someone famous sat across the table from us. ? but it was yummy, comfortable, loud enough to drown my obnoxious cries for more sauce and, "oh man, you've gotta try this" across the table. ? i am definitely going back sober. ?ok, who am i kidding?

The last two times I've left Fette Sau, in the back of my head I thought, "They should call this place Cash Cow," instead. The surly, unfriendly, impatient man who cuts the meats uses the same knife for everything, and he cuts everything the same way (sometimes improperly), and he allows the juices from each meat to remain on the singular cutting-board, never cleaning it, placing the next hunk of meat directly on top of this long-standing puddle of fluid -- and the next one after that, and the next one after that, and the next one after that... I'm all for flavor, but I want my Pork Belly to taste like Pork Belly, not like Spicy Sausage and Beef Short-Rib and Pastrami and Brisket. To me Barbecue and Grilling is all about, to quote King of the Hill, "taste the meat, not the heat," which sort of brings me to my next point. It is my opinion that the meats here are over-treated and excessively seasoned. What's the point of "organic" and "grass-fed" and "free-range" if it's all buried under copious amounts of spice rub? But that's not my only complaint about the flavor of the meat being hidden and disguised and adulterated. There's also the buffet display case in which all the meats are kept, it is my opinion that all of these meats are kept entirely too close to one another. When the man reaches in with tongs to pick out one meat, the juices drip on all the other meats, and this happens all day long... Yet sometimes, somehow, things still manage to end up dry and/or tough. Oh, and none of the meat here is ever hot, it's all luke-warm, because the buffet display case (mentioned above) is always kept wide-open, it's never closed, all the warmth escapes, leaving all of the meats oftentimes almost cold, which is fine for things like Pulled-Pork or Lamb Tongue, but definitely not for Wagyu Beef-Cheeks or Sirloin. On an episode of Top Chef a season or two ago, one of the contestants, short on time, threw a dish together before all the separate ingredients were properly prepared, and one of the judges responded to the hard-pressed Chef's claims that this was intentional with "There's no such thing as al-dente beans." Well each time I've taste-tested the Burnt-End Baked-Beans, they've been under-cooked and fibrous, plus, the chunks of meat have been bloated and bland. Yes, overall, it's very flavorful, perhaps due to all the juices of the other meats dripping into the vast vat, it's slightly sweet and slightly sour and slightly spicy, but I think they could perhaps remove these jiggly chunks toward the end of preparation and replace them with fresh bits, maybe even letting the whole pot cook a little longer, so that the beans could hopefully lose their consistent undesirable mineral-like characteristic. Sauerkraut is characterless, as are the half-sour Pickles, as is the Potato Salad, and also the Potato Salad, and so too is the Broccoli Salad... The only side-dish they make that I find even slightly exciting is their Cole Slaw, which, in all honesty, I really like... And the Habanero Chips (pre-bagged) on offer aren't half bad either! The Potato Rolls they hand out for every order free of charge are fine, nice and soft, but forgettable -- good for taking up space in an empty stomach and saving stress on ones billfold but not very much else. For me, the best part of Fette Sau is the terrific and affordable selection of beer. My recommendation is: go with a group of friends, share a gallon of beer (perhaps something by Captain Lawrence Brewery of Sixpoint Craft Ales Brewery, two of my regional favorites), on your big metal tray mix together the three house sauces (5 parts sweet bbq, 3 parts passila pepper, 1 part hot mustard), and order for each person 1/2 lb of Berkshire Pork Belly, a side of Cole Slaw, make sure to sit outside (it's better to be around the dogs in fresh air than to be around a bunch of screaming children in a dark over-crowded cavern), and don't let your high expectations get the best of you. Also, try not to get too comfortable: they rush you in & they rush you out.

my shirt is delicious! ?i was at Fette Sau last night and the smell of the place has attached itself to my clothes...shirts, jacket, jeans and hair. ?but i'm not complaining. ?i might even try to taste it. pork by the pound, and an exciting selection of beers, bourbons and ryes...this place will undoubtedly be a great place for summer drunkenness and the gorging of oneself, especially with all the benches outside. ? we sampled some of the brisket, pork belly and pork loin with baked beans and pickles on the side...all excellent. ?a half gallon each of the chocolate lager and one of the heavyweight beers, as well as a few snifters of bourbon and rye were great to help wash it all down. ?the only thing missing was the corn bread. ?CORN BREAD!!! ?you call this BBQ?!?! actually the food was so good that we weren't satisfied with our initial portions. so hepatitis C be damned!...we stealthily pulled an unfinished tray of pork chunks freshly left behind by two girls. ?quitters! the decor is simple and interesting. ?it looks like a cross between my high school bathroom and something out of the movie Saw (especially with various knives and torture devices for beer taps), however they don't serve urinal cakes. ?so much for high school nostalgia. the place was pretty great, but it's not the type of place you'd want to eat at too often. ?your belly will get fatter as your wallet gets thinner. ?and make no mistake about it...a half hour in this place and you WILL reek of BBQ!

The food is decent. ?All the sides I tried (broccoli salad, baked beans, potato salad, pickles) were very good. ?The meat is flavorful, but kinda greasy. ?That being said, I paid $22 for more than enough food that I shared with a few friends, which isnt so bad. ?If I had paid a lot more than that, I would say that the food isnt really worth it. ?Now comes the bad part: ?THIS PLACE IS RIDICULOUS. ?I have never in my life seen a more moronic way to run a restaurant. ?Anything redeeming about the food still doesnt really make this place worth it. ? You walk into the place, and there are no employees there to explain to you how the process works. ?You sort of have to figure out that you are to FIRST find the end of the line and just wait. ?I got there at 6:45 on a Saturday night, and waited on the line for about 30-40 minutes. ?I was there for a birthday party, and some friends had arrived first and were closer to the front of the line. ?By the time I got my food, they were already finished eating. ?This was pretty much how it was for all our friends who arrived at different times. ? After getting your food, you just have to hope that a seat opens up somewhere. ?Dont try to go to this restaurant with more than 2 or 3 people because there is no guarantee that you will actually find seating next to each other (or of course you can opt to sit outside at the tables and eat in 30 degree weather like some of my friends had to.) ?All the while, there are no employees present to actually monitor this situation. ?For example, they dont seem to care that there are more people on line than can actually be accommodated at the tables. ?If you are lucky enough to find seats next to each other, then you quickly realize that you have to eat fast and get out of there because there is another poor sap after you getting his food with nowhere to sit. All in all, I would not recommend this place for people who want a relaxing night out eating BBQ. ?You have to stand on line forever, and then eat your food fast and then go. ?I think its kinda stupid...

it was a bi-weekly thing. ?but then it got kind of expensive. ?not only that i think my heart was slowing down considerably from all that meat. ? i love fette sau. i was never much of a bbq man before but after fette...well...after fette everything changed. its just all good. ?i've had almost every cut of meat that they offered and i only found one not to be up to my tastes. ?that one was the pig tail. ?but pig's tail is an acquired taste i would think. ?my favorites are: the veal sausages, the ribs and the pulled pork. ?the ribs are cooked for 11 hours and come right off the bone to satiate your every carniverous need. ?the sausage explodes into a world of flavor with a peppery kick as you bite through the casing. ?the pulled pork simply melts in your mouth...and possibly your hand if you are to handle it without utensils. ?the beans that they have also have a little bit of spice to it. ?but i figure going to fette sau is like going to a steak house. ?you don't go for the salad when you go to the steak house, you go for the steak. ?likewise, if you're going to fette you need to get your meat. they have a huge selection of whiskey. ?a pretty good stock of their own beers which range from ales to stouts. ?my usual is a rack of ribs, two sausages (which sometimes is pork, sometimes veal), and some pulled pork. ?that costs around $25. ?but i dont eat it in one sitting, still good when you have it reheated...not as good as fresh on the metal tray but....still good. five stars for making me fat and spend way too much money. ?i'm going to quote my brother "i feel the way a tyrannosaurus must feel after eating a brontosaurus"

hmmm...so when I think of Fette Sau two distinct memories pop into my head: 1. Yummmmm - that was the best hunk of meat I've ever tasted! 2. Yuuuuuuck - why did I mix three types of alcohol? I stumbled in here late one Friday evening after having wine and sushi at some msg den in midtown. I'm not a huge carnivore, but drinking stirs certain urges. And by the time I got to Fette Sau I was pretty certain that I had been reborn as a ravenous little t-rex....(by this point, I was also probably introducing myself as Shirley Temple, but I digress....) Fette Sau is a neat little joint, and honestly, it's just as much about the experience as it is about the food here. You walk into a large, open, warehouse-like building with several communal tables. At the far side is a bar where you order food and drinks. It can be quite busy at times, so seating is competitive. Be prepared to do some table stalking and possible hipster-nudging.... Upon arrival we squeezed ourselves into one of the long tables. I was pushed up against a tight-lipped fedora-wearing blonde who didn't seem to appreciate the invasion. (But I thrashed my dinosaur fangs at him and he scooted on down.) ?Fette Sau has a great selection of beer, so I went to the counter to get something on tap-- and ended up coming back to the table with a whiskey double and a plate of brisket & pickles.... I felt a little like a confused pregnant woman, but I embraced my impulsive buys and dug in. The meat was absolutely delicious. Tender, flavorful, and very(dare I say)meaty ;). All of my "oh I only eat white fish and non-gluten bread" friends were suddenly stealing bites of my plate. We polished off the meal like a good little pack of raptors and finished the night off with another round of whiskey. Despite the fact that I woke up the next morning feeling/looking like Amy Whinehouse, I still have fond memories of this place. I'll definitely go back when spring gets into full gear. C U there kitties ;)

This might be a little long, but you rarely hear a 1 minute love song. You can smell the BBQ smell a block away, on a good day 2 to 3 blocks. When you get there, there's a good chance you'll have to wait in line for a bit. This isn't the best time in the world but it builds anticipation, especially when all you're smelling is BBQ. Its a good time to grab one of the wide selection of great beers they have in numerous sizes from a pint to a gallon... Or one of there great whiskey flights. Once you get to the food it's time for some real decisions. I feel everything i've eaten there is phenomenal. They have a daily rotating menu with a few staples. I will always ?suggest getting the pulled pork. I find its the best ways to test a BBQ joint. If brisket is on the menu i will also say not to pass that up. Other than that, whatever is in the case get a 1/2 lb of it and one of your friends will help you with it. There sides are good. They're vinegar style BBQ sides, Broccoli salad, Potato salad, ect, and some homemade baked beans. There meats are better than there sides though. So much so that i say if you must, just get one side and grab one of there homemade sausages as well. It tends to get really busy on weekends, but its NYC and that should say something about how good it is. In short, if you are in the mood for some great BBQ. Go to Fette Sau.

The barbecue craze is a little overblown in this town these days, but Fette Sau gets the job done better than most. ?You can only buy meat by the pound. ?If you know BBQ, that's real. ?This is one of the few places in town that recognizes you need cider vinegar if you're gonna eat pulled pork. ?No sandwiches here...you'll have to rip open a roll and make your own. ?The owners of beer bar Spuyten Duyvill are behind this place, and they've definitely got their beer right, although I would like to see some cheap bottles on the menu. ?People seem to be claiming the sides are no good here, but come on people, are you really going to a BBQ joint because their potato salad is amazing? ? This experience is about THE MEAT people. ?But I guess that we New Yorkers expect the world. ?There's also plenty of seating at picnic tables outside, which is a very nice touch for the warmer months.

When I woke up this morning, I could still smell the wonderful smoked meat smell that hangs in the air over Fette Sau like a cloud of volcanic ash. ?If you have a huge hankering for smokey perfectly BBQ'd meat, and you have the patience of a saint look no further. Yesterday a friend and I shared a tray of pork cheek, brisket, pork loin, sweet pork sausage, and sides of amazingly tasty baked beans, and potato salad. The brisket was amazing, the beef really seemed to hold the smokey flavor much better than the pork loin in my opinion, yet both were nice and moist chunks of perfectly seasoned meat. The pork cheek stood out the most though, the outer skin looked burnt, but actually revealed a whole pile of sweet and tender porky goodness. I would leave my comfortable apartment to set up camp in front of Fette Sau, just so I could eat this amazing food every day. ? If you're coming for the first time, don't worry about finding a seat, trust me by the time you get your food and drinks there will be a seat on one of the picnic benches for you to park your keester on. Also, have fun and get something that seems a bit crazy, you'll be rewarded by perfectly smoked melt in your mouth flavor. Oh, and if you're hanging out with vegetarians after eating here, you may want to stop home and shower, I doubt they'll appreciate you smelling like a butcher shop.

I usually use baby back ribs as a litmus test for BBQ joints but they didn't have any the night I went. Judging by the beef brisket (best I've EVER had) and pulled pork, this place is in the same company as some of the best joints in Harlem. BUT a huge part of BBQ is about the sauce. And their sauces, in a word, suck. I prefer KC Masterpiece to anything they offer. Their best sauce was in their baked beans. Bring your own sauce. Seriously. Their meat and beer + not their sauce and you'll have an amazing meal.

I'm basing this review off the past 3 visits. First visit, absolutely phenomenal. My group got there when it first opened (there was already a line) and within 10 minutes received some of the most delectable bbq you can find in nyc. The second visit was the same, except we got there around 8 pm and the line was about 30 minutes. This last visit was around 6pm, and it took over an hour and 15 minutes (?!!), much of the beef brisket was kind of ligament-y and very fatty (they should have trimmed it better), the jowls were buttery melty heart attack balls (aka wunderbar!), and they only had 2 ribs left and they were cold. Pickles here are a special treat, but what Fette Sau really needs to do in my opinion is to have a second or third station for weighing food and serving people. The bbq here merits a 4 star on average, but with the loooooooong waits and hassle of being served pre-cooked food, I'll only come back when the line is either short or handled more efficiently.

hi. i loved this place. what a great feeling of community. long picnic table seating. gallon jugs of beer. big mounds of tasty meat. a DVD of a fireplace. maybe it was just the delightful company i was with, but last night at fette sau's was one of the most enjoyable nights i've had in new york. the sausage was unbelievable. flavorful with just the right spicy kick. i could have eaten 10. had the beef ribs with coleslaw on a potato roll. not the best ribs i've ever had, but still good. potato salad = excellent. got a group of rowdy beer-drinking meat-eaters? this is the place for you.

To optimize Fette Sau enjoyment, bring along a few friends. ?Have one stand in line to order food, one to wait for/scout for a table and another friend to buy beers for all waiting parties. ? 100,984,234% worth the wait, time, cost, etc etc. ?This place is GREAT.

It's official.... Fette Sau is the best BBQ in NYC below 131st street (I don't know if I could choose between Fette and Dinsosaur). ?Fette Sau is an order by the pound cafeteria-style eatery in a converted garage with 3 large communal tables in the garage and additional outdoor picnic tables (think Hill Country but with much better food but a little more chaos). ?When you arrive, you saddle up to a long line to join more people that have no idea what they are doing or what they should do. ?Everyone kind of asks everyone else what they should be doing, yet no one really has a clue. ?The money move is to have someone wait on line while someone else goes to the bar and grabs drinks. ?They have an excellent selection of whiskey, bourbon and beer (they sell growlers and other large beer receptacles). ?I would also recommend grabbing a table whenever you have the chance to. The wait for food on a Saturday night was probably around 40 minutes. ?Fette Sau has worked out the timing so that tables usually open up by the time you get your food. ?Personally I would appreciate if they had an employee stationed to help with the seating situation. ?Just like 'Nam, there are no rules when it comes to grabbing tables which leads to unnecessary anxiety. ?Are you going to get a seat? ?Why are these people sitting for so long? ?Am I sitting too long? ?Am I going to have to fight to secure these seats?? ?I don't know... ahhhhh!!! Let's be honest though, all that matters is the food. ?I went with three other people so I was able to try pretty much the entire menu. ?The pork belly is amazing although it is incredibly fatty. ?I don't really mind it but some of the ladies in my party were a little turned off by all the fat. We also had the pulled pork, boneless beef ribs and brisket. ?Everything was incredible. ?The meats were perfectly smoker and incredibly juicy. ?The meat comes dry, but they have sauces (NC vinegar, regular sweet BBQ and mustard) on the tables. Unfortunately the pork ribs had been taken off the menu when we ordered but by the time we were finishing up they were added back on. At least our table mate was generous enough to let us have a rib to taste; and they say New Yorkers aren't friendly. ?For sides we had the beans with burnt ends brisket that was maybe the best BBQ side I have ever eaten and the broccoli flavored garlic...err... broccoli that was heavy on garlic. I will definitely be back very soon since I have a ton of friends that need to take a trip on the L to eat some incredible Que.

If you like BBQ, go here. ?The ambiance was perfect, the wall decorated with different cuts/types of meat was really cool to check out. We went on a Tues night and had to wait for a few to get a seat on one of the benches. ?It wasn't too bad cuz we sat at the bar. ?I expected the meat to be a bit juicier but all in all it was good.

Very unique and very tasty barbecue. The staff is helpful and the menu changes, so you'll never get bored. The barbecue sauce on the tables if fantastic; one is really spicy and one is smokey and sweet (I recommend combining the two). The brisket is my absolute favorite and the beers come by any size from 1/2 pint to a gallon. The potato salad is really delicious, and the baked beans are out of this world.

amazing AND ridiculous the bff took me here during my yearly new years nyc visit and LET ME TELL YOU I will be returning. these are the reasons: - you get to choose all your meats by weight (not just like combo meals at some places). I got ribs, brisket, sausage, AND pork shoulder. Don't judge me even though most people in my group ordered even less than me and shared it. I ate it ALL. YUM. - the bread rolls they come with are amazing. you can make your own little sandwich. - good selection of sauces. I like variety in my life and I also mix them. - german style potato salad and baked beans were the icing on the CAKE. ok so fette sau is amazing and I'M just ridiculous p.s. when you get in line, send someone to start hovering around the tables or you will be stuck WITH your food and WITHOUT anywhere to sit. never fun.

Came with three friends for dinner on a weekend. Service was super slow and it took us 1.5 hours to get through the line since there was only one person slicing/weighing/wrapping the food. We had two people canvas the small seating area to secure seats yet still took more than an hour to get a bench. Despite building up an appetite while on line, the barbeque was only above average IMO. It was definitely not worth the wait in the heat from the summer night and the pit. I appreciated the decor and the dining concept, but the overall experience was mediocre. I wonder if the weekday service would be better.

Never ever in my life did I think I would eat pork belly and enjoy it. Hell, I'd never even had pork belly until I went to Fette Sau. The sausage was fantastic. The potato salad and beans, no so much. I had the cider to drink, which was good, and I love that they serve drinks in old mason jars. I suggest going with several people and try a little bit of everything. I'm not a huge BBQ fan, hence the mediocre rating, but I'd go again.

Went to this place for the first time last week with a group of friends for some post-happy hour belly-filling. ?Great open air, warm, summer night ambiance. ?One friend and I split a pound of shoulder, a pound of pork belly, a couple of sausages, and beans. ?Initially, I thought we ordered too much but we managed to get it all down. ?And it was all delicious. ?The pork was fantastic. ?I've always been a fan of shoulder/butt, but never delved into the fattier belly and I was amazed at how the fat holds onto the smokey flavor. ?The sausage was fantastic too but since I saved that for the end it was hard to enjoy on an overstuffed stomach. ?And the beans were some of the best I can recall having in a long time. ?Good vinegar based sauces, too. ?They also had a decent selection of great beers on tap, served out of jugs. ?A great bbq experience in Williamsburg.

My suggestion is that you bring friends, one to find a seat, one to get some beer from the tap, which you can't miss because there chef knives; as handles. The service is quick even though the lines are immense, yeah it may cost a little more, but its amazing.

Eating at Fette Sau was a whole experience... I felt like the staff there were all in the same club and they were just sharing their whole vibe with anyone that wanted to check it out. ?It had a very cohesive atmosphere of blue collar hipster. ? You wait in line to order, order by the pound from a limited menu, get your food on a tray to share, and sit on community benches picnic style. They have a huge selection of whiskey... and not the usual lot of Jack Daniel's, Johnny Walker, etc. ?It's as if they purposefully eliminated any brand you've ever heard of so you have to try something new. ?The beer was the same deal and you could only get it from the tap (which all of the handles are of butcher tools). ?They serve the beer in jugs only... you drink from jars. The bbq is legit. ?Nice smokey rubbed taste. ?We got an assortment of beef and pork, ribs and brisket. ?Everything was good. ?They have 5 different sauces that you can add to it... but i prefered it without sauce or the normal bbq sauce. The wait is significant, but worth it. ?It isn't a very large place.

It's awesome. I love that all of their meat come from local and organic farms. Since my husband doesn't eat non-organic meat, this place is the only place that he'd eat barbecue, at least in this city. I also like that their meat selection changes all the time and how they're sold (per pound) and served. We chose pulled pork, beef brisket, and pork sausages the last time we were there. Now I'm not a barbecue expert and have not had any Southern barbecue so I don't know how they hold up to the "real deal" but to me they tasted pretty damn good! Great baked beans with chunks of pork in it and I like the potato rolls they give you too. We got out around $12-13 per person and all of us were pretty satisfied. I'd definitely go back.

This is one of my favorite eateries in one of my least favorite neighborhoods. My hatred for Williamsburg doesnt stop me from going to Fette Sau as much as I can (without immediately dying of heart desease). I try to have a meal here maybe 6 times a year. More if I have guests from out of town that need to go. The food is amazing, the brisket is my favorite, perfect juicy, not too fatty, melt in your mouth goodness! Pork Tips or whatever they call them is phenomenal. Who cares if one bite can possibly kill you instantly? It would be worth it! I hate beans, but they make some damned good beans! F-Yeah I love their food, they're my body's worst nightmare. Round it off with a jug of their tasty selection of beer and your happier then a pig in shit...or in their case, a pig in the smoker. Just writing about it makes me want to cab it over to pick up a couple of pounds of heaven. Ive always said that thank god they're in Williamsburg, otherwise I would be long dead by now. If they were anywhere else, I would consider moving closer to them. Its sad, very very sad, how much I crave their meat -- "thats what she said!" The only down side to Fette Sau is that they fill up fast, and seating is limited. If you go, pick a weekday, and get their early!

Wow pork galore! I feel bad for what goes on with the piggies in this place. The pulled pork was amazing. The pork belly was just FAT so it wasn't my cup of tea. The sausage was delicious. This place is a bit on the expensive side. I took away a star for that. And another star because the stupid server ruined our night by being strict with the NON-byob policy. He even brought out a baggie in an attempt to kick us out even though we were sitting outside. So we took our pork and left. Hmph. I enjoyed my pork better with my coors light at home anyway!

Fette Sau has officially ruined all other BBQ for me. ?Although I'm not the biggest fan of Hipster-ville Williamsburg, I make my way out there at least 1-2 weekends a month for some tasty morsels of meat. ? Some of the staples you can find there are Ribs, Pulled Pork and Brisket. ? All of which are highly recommended! ? I'm not a baked beans kinda guy either, but my friends are all in love with the burnt ends baked beans there...sometimes you'll hit the jackpot and find huge chunks of meat in them. ? ? This place is a little pricey and you'll want to try everything they have to offer. ? There are usually 6-7 types of meat pork or beef dishes per day. ?The menu changes daily but never disappoints. ?The cafeteria style line and seating arrangements can be a little cumbersome in the summertime as the line will normally number 30+ people. ? Upon arriving at the serving station, you will find yourself presented with delectable cuts of meat which are listed price per pound. ?I highly recommend the flank steak and brisket. ? Fette Sau also offers a rather huge selection of whiskey and a good selection of beers. ?The beers are served in mason jars ranging from a small cup to a gallon jug. ?Thats right.....you can buy a gallon of beer. ? If you're a fan of BBQ...or just meat in general, check out Fette Sau. ?Bring an appetite!!

This place is a great place to get your greasy, fatty, good-in-your-belly barbecue grub on. ?Order by the pound or whatever fraction of it at the counter of whatever you want. ?The sausages are delish and the ribs are good too - though the pork belly is a tad bit fatty. ?Get a variety though because each thing has its own flavor and you can get carried away with ordering. ?The beans are good, the potato salad is so-so, and the bread is so-so but it does the job. ?Drinks will be poured - or pour yourself for water - in mason jars. ?The back wall is painted with different meat cuts and there's an LCD fireside. ?Slightly rustic, slightly humorous. ?The place is aimed at being friendly and having a good time - share a roll of paper towels with your neighbor down the bench table. ? Their bbq sauces could be better. Don't wear your best shirt here.

Went on a slightly chilly sunday night, but there were still people sitting outside. After a twenty minute wait (a second person serving just take out would be a perfect solution) ordered what turned out to be the perfect amount of food for two adults and a 12 year old girl. Quarter pound each of pulled pork, sirloin tips and half pound of brisket and a hot sausage along with for sides. Sirloin was great. Pulled pork and brisket were good. Beans were phenomenal. Would go back, but need to figure out when there is no line. Beer and whiskey abound at the bar, and there are enough choices there for everyone.

first of all let me say the location is cute and quite catchy. its pretty much in an alley that leads to a garage that has been made into a tiny restaurant.. if you can even call it that. they ran out of the pulled pork, so they up sold us on the pulled lamb without mentioning the price difference... $18 a lb for pork, and $32 a lb for lamb. i thought that was a pretty d*ck move of them to do that. 1/2 lb of 4 different meats, 1 side, and a couple drinks ended up coming to $80. for the amount of food we got, it was WAYYYYY over priced. the beef brisket was good. but the pork ribs they gave us were the scrawny last 2 pieces that no one else wanted and the boneless beef ribs were DRY. BBQ sauce they provided was ok, but they really need to offer one with a kick and some heat! overall, NOT WORTH THE PRICE.

oh, so this is what bbq is supposed to taste like...instead of writing NYC bbq off completely after a really crap meal last week (see last review), i figured i'd indulge my passover fueled brisket binge and raise it some swine. a whole hog better than swill hill country, this place gets the rating for the food rather than just looking good and being centrally located. ?juicy ribs were the highlight of all around tasty vittles, eclectic beer and stellar bourbon selections help wash it down, and communal outdoor seating that featured visiting distillers and a comatosed transvestite made this a great venue. can't wait to come back the next time i find myself 'burg bound...

Very beautiful and communal faux-rustic dining experience, not to mention a more than adequate bar, well stocked with beers, whiskeys and the like. However, the buck stops there. ?This is some strange tasting BBQ. ?I presume it is supposed to be inventive, but I found it to be dry in every sense the word. The brisket was dry, dry, dry, dry. ?When a customer mentioned respectfully to the counter person that he was cutting the brisket wrong, the poor guy (the customer) received the proverbial Williamsburg 'tude. The pulled pork was nice enough, I suppose, and the sides were about alright at the most. It is risky business when you experiment with BBQ. ?I am no expert, by any means, but a nice bar, ambiance and mediocre food will not suffice for this little porker. Well, maybe I will give this place another try and try to convince myself of the hype. ?Until then, the hunt for tasty BBQ for a reasonable price will resume.

Meat garage: a garage of meat. Any time my friends or I have asked, "Do you want to go to the meat garage?" the answer has always been a resounding "Let me get my keys." ?I've been several times in a week. ?You have to wait in a line and fight for a seat, but it's well worth it to dig into a tray of meats and without question the best rolls I have ever consumed. ?The brisket is excellent, the spare ribs are excellent, the short ribs are excellent, the pork belly is excellent, the pulled pork is fan-freaking-tastic. ?That's just what I ate last night. ?You will go into a food coma, and/or have meat sweats, and you will regret absolutely nothing. ?Plus, the beer comes from taps that are various pointy kitchen implements. ?I'm not that much into beer, but I am into the repurposing of sharp things. ?You will probably not be able to have an intimate conversation here (I'm looking at you, guys sitting next to me last night that were discussing how annoying this girl's mother is), but you will get to sit yourself at a long wooden table, wave about a jar of liquid, and warm yourself in front of a fake fireplace like a king. ?You will overload your senses on meat. ?In a garage.

The one thing I expected going to New York was excellent barbecue, I mean besides muggings and apples, I think that's number one. ?Okay maybe not, but it was a nice surprise. ?In any case, Fette Sau is an impressive little place for several reasons. ?Its pink neon sign looks a little frou frou pretentious, the inside is kind of homey industrial... The seating is communal and the food is served directly on trays with butcher paper. ?It's nice in a city where everything is so put together, it's nice to have a dim and totally casual atmosphere. ?You walk in to the smell of rich fatty smoke, a lineup of hungry hipster types and a chalkboard full of the daily meats. ?You order everything at the counter and meats are sold by the pound. ?There's a bar to the left of the counter that has a vast selection of whiskeys... ?They have a wall-sized blackboard covered with flights of whiskey from preschool to old-school. ?If you order your whiskey on the rocks it comes as a 2 oz jigger pour, so you'll be getting roughly the same amount every time, and they serve it in an old fashioned glass with the requisite 2x2 inch rock(ask for the McKendrick's western-style whiskey, it's amazing and super hard to find). ?They serve beer in increments from 8oz to gallon jugs and all pretty fairly priced. ? It's kind of confusing trying to figure out how much meat to order since the prices are by the pound, but ?your 'cue slinger can size you up pretty well(you can always go get more). ?I'm glad we let him pick how much we ate because I'd have ordered a pound of everything and as it was we left to-go containers of the vegetable sides in our friends' fridge when we fled the city. ?We opted for the boneless beef rib, wild boar belly and sliced brisket, with small sides of burnt-ends beans, Chef's broccoli salad and german potato salad. ?The long benches at the chow-tables were all full of people and jackets, so we took the last two thresher seats available at the bar and were glad we did. ?Having a knowledgeable whiskey bartender almost to ourselves was interesting, not to mention she was quick with the mason jars of ice water. The Brisket was by far the star of the tray. ?It fell apart when the guy was slicing it, and had a nice layer of blackened fat over the top. The texture was perfect and they had good permeation/penetration w/the smoke. ?The boar belly, as one might expect, was a little tougher than pork belly, but the flavor was uhmazing and it was a little leaner than the pork. I'm kind of putting them in order of best to worst, so the beef rib, while the taste was spot on, the texture was kind of rough. The veg was ok, I mean, it was good, but I was way more into the meat so maybe that's why. ?I have to say that the beans were a little too molassesy for me and the german potato salad needed some more salt and vinegar. The broccoli salad was really good, though, lightly cooked broccoli with some red pepper flakes and vinegar, served cold. ? Don't come here looking for saucy barbecue... ?Well, not the pre-sauced Chili's/Chain rib joint style stuff. ? The sauce is served on the table and you have your choice... There are hotter smokier options, the classic reddish stuff with the sheen to it, and an excellent horseradishy/sharp mustard that goes surprisingly well on stuff, especially the broccoli. ? This place is super popular, so get there early, and don't forget the McKendrick's(how can you go wrong with a whiskey filtered with mesquite chips?). Oh yeah and they open at five so don't try for lunch there. I'm sad that I didn't get me some pulled pork, since that's my general BBQ benchmark, but we'll be back... hopefully sooner than later.

Honestly, sometimes the wait / table campers frustrate me, but that all goes away once I'm eating my pork ribs. The shoulder and brisket fluctuate, but those ribs just keep on staying delicious every time I come here. Eat them. ?Also, I like the broccoli and collards. But I get stupid for brassicas.

I think many of the new BBQ places in the city, and up north in general, seem to think "the fattier the better". Most of the meats they serve up here are wayyy too fatty, to the point where they will make you sick. Good BBQ should be somewhat lean and its juiciness should come from the slow cooking, not loads of lard. Last but not least, the beer selection is okay, but pricey.

Fette Sau is a recipe for a fette, but happy customer. Some of the best BBQ I've had, especially when good BBQ is hard to come by in the city. You can't go wrong with the selection of meat, but be careful not to order too much. A 1/4 pound here and there adds up, and becomes very very filling. No matter which meats you decide on, definitely stock up on some extra dinner rolls, baked beans, pickles, and coleslaw. The beer selection here is decent, but what tops it off is the fact that the tap handles are made of butcher knives. Speaking of which, the space is great, once inside you immediately understand the attitude and mission of Fette Sau. It's purely about the food and is unpretentious. Communal dinning tables and other ad hoc elements create a great vibe. I wouldn't recommend it for groups, as grabbing seats sometimes gets difficult. Make sure to have someone poach for seats while the other waits in line to order.

Piiiiig. ?Faaaaat. ?Ghhhhhhl... ?[/homersimpson] I wish that's all I had to say before slapping a 5-star on this because if you buy into it, there is definitely a certain primal undeniable state of satisfaction achieved by engorging oneself here. But then I remember that *every* time I've gone here it's been well after any notion of a possible dinner rush, in a group of people capable of obtaining and keeping table space (if not smelly enough to clear some), and in an extremely famished state having just run around outside in McCarren Park for reasons bordering on questionable. So, for that specific situation, hey cool. ?"I'm down" as the hipsters might say. Without all of the above variables in place, I'd likely find the bare-bones approach to everything but (most of) the meat and (some of) the booze to be grating, especially at the prices they charge (or I should say the cumulative price of the pound or more of meat I typically get), but for now, nothing has registered as a problem severe enough to scare me off. ?Yet. The food itself does seem to vary somewhat (aside from the rotating meat menu which I get is necessary given the prep and quantities involved). ?I guess given the "certain primal undeniable state of satisfaction" from said meat my expectations for everything else (sides, sauces, booze) aren't that far above "they, like, dude, uhhh, haven't sucked twice in a row... ?yet." so no biggy. Alright, well, 3+ stars it is then due to the nagging suspicion that I order so much because I'm diversifying (n quarter-pound or link portions of x, y, z, etc.) to mitigate inconsistencies in the food. ?Weird? ?Yeah, dude.

The Q is expertly cooked, but the cuts themselves could be a bit more appealing. ?While gristle adds taste, I'd like a better meat to gristle ratio on my plate. ?The sides are pretty solid, however. ?I'd have liked more choices in sauce, since the one they put out is pretty bland. ?I'm sure there's better BBQ to be had for similar prices around here, and I'm going to find it.

If you love meat but does not care about atmosphere, this is the place for you. You can get pounds and pounds of different kinds of barbecue meat at relatively low prices. However, there is no waiter service, the seating is limited, it's basically self serve counter kinda place and not a restaurant. So if you are hungry, and just want beer and meat, then this place is perfect, but if you want a sit down place, this is not for you.

Excellent BBQ. My favorites were the pulled pork, spicy pork sausage, and beans. The pulled pork was very juicy. The spicy pork sausage had a perfect amount of spice. Everything was delicious.

the idea is brilliant! the food is tasty... you have to wait in line for like 45 minutes... and ?when you order by the pound... they literally give you a pound of the meat... that would be awesome, if it were high quality pre-trimmed meat. We ordered 1 pound of the delicious brisket and got a 1/2 a pound of fat... which of course, we do not want to eat. it was very disappointing. ?so, my husband and i shared the 1/2 pound... spending our dinner budget, and walking away hungry. however--- LOVED the atmosphere, the gallon of beer is cool. otherwise. no thanks.

The quality of meat served here is top-notch; unfortunately, it's also poorly seasoned (if at all), and leaner cuts were dry. ?Here's a quick run-through: -Boneless Beef Rib: Granted, I usually like my red meat cooked just beyond the point where it might put up a fight, but this cut of boneless rib was feisty! I had to fight it with a fork, 2 hands, and my teeth before managing to rip a bite off the dry, fibrous log. - Beef Brisket: The quality of the meat was evident, but again, it was cooked so dry that it stuck together like a brick instead of falling apart like brisket should. Additionally, a simple dash of salt would've really helped to bring out the flavor of the meat. - Pork Belly: This was a lot more moist; naturally the ribbon of fat that defines a pork belly helped to improve the fate of this cut. However, flavor again was lacking and i really craved salt along with a dousing of the bbq sauce to accompany. - Pulled Pork Shoulder: Easily the best of the meat, this may have been some of the best pulled pork I've had in a while. It was minimally seasoned, but a little dip in bbq sauce and vinegar really brought out the best. - Sausage: Always a fan of a good weiner, this one had a light fennel aroma, but I wished it had some grill marks to give it the char it needed. I regretted not trying one of the pork ribs, but they looked too dry and lean in the meat case to bet on. Also the broccoli side salad was fantastic, outshining some of the meat. I was amused by the fireplace video in the wall and the trailer park/vintage feel of the outside front patio area, but the real star of this place is the bar! Whiskey flights ranging from $12-$18 for 3 tastes, with some flights hovering at higher price ranges. You can get a glass gallon for $32-36. The bloody mary was SLAMMIN! the best and most perfect I've had in nyc. Be prepared to wait, as the line forms quickly and service is typical Williamsburg (sloooooooow). Communal seating is first come, first serve, and credit cards are accepted.

I've had better BBQ at the Waterfront Ale House on Atlantic Ave. & Bubby's Restaurant in Dumbo. It's not fair to make comparisons since FS isn't looking for competition except to be a local no-frills barbecue joint where you don't get penalized for improper food etiquette. The food is acceptably good, but not spectacular by Zagat standards. The first time I walked by this place on a rainy Friday, I had mistaken it for someone's driveway until I noticed the small pink neon sign by the entrance. We didn't stay long since it was crowded by 6:30pm. We decided to make a second trip here showing up no later than 5pm (open time) while the meat is still fresh. Even at such an early hour, this place packs up very quickly. The atmosphere is not romantic, but it is laid back and casual. The dcor is purposely scaled down to resemble a suburban backyard with plenty of wooden tables and benches. Food is served on paper plates & paper towels function as napkins. Service is performed cafeteria style, so no need to calculate gratuity after dinner. ?We chose to sit at the bar away from the noisy crowd. They have a good beer selection on tap, but they also have an extension selection of whisky (almost a hundred) from 5 different countries. Since I can't handle hard liquor, I ordered a Six Point Mason Black Wheat brewed special only for FS. I liked that they served all their beers in ornate mason jars. I loved the beer as well. It tastes like a combination of French roast coffee & liquid dark chocolate...coffee bean bitter, not sweet. We ordered half a pound each of the pork & brisket. The pork was juicy but I felt the brisket was a little dry. As far the sauces, I liked the spicy chipotle but I'd stay away from the sweet flavored barbecue sauce. If you are not a fan of either once of these sauces, stick with the vinegar. The baked beans could have been better if it wasn't doused with so much honey. Since I'm a sucker for casual no frills establishments, I would definitely come back for the beers on tap only.

BEST BBQ in NYC, and it's way better than any BBQ in Los Angeles. My brother and I waited about 45 minutes in line and had a great time. You can order a drink while you are in line so you at least can quench your thirst while you wait. We got the baked beans, brisket, pork, and something else and cleared our tray in like 5 minutes. GO HERE and get a shirt. also if you show up really late before they close the line won't be so bad.

This place brings out my inner caveman: bring me platters of meat and endless jugs of beer! You'll want to arrive early to have your choice of meats, because if you get here after 8pm, especially on a weekend, you'll likely be down to links and pulled pork. And you don't want to miss the BBQ pork belly! Best to arrive with a party large enough to split into thirds: one third to stand in line for food, another to stand in line for beer, and another to hold down an open table.

I had just learned how to butcher a pig at work, and while telling a friend about it they suggested this place for dinner. Win. The menu is really straightforward, as is the preparation of the meats. But it's all delicious. I particularly recommend the pork belly, and the ribs. The sauces they offer on the table are tasty, but try to meat as it comes first. A good selection of beers, and a nice bartender, plus the fun of communal tables- it was a great place to go out to eat with out having to feel as formal as a traditional restaurant. Be warned though- this place is busy esp in the summer, so if you come with a big group, best luck finding tables!

GREAT tasting meat. ?And MORE great tasting meat. Each time I go to Fette Sau, I just want to have everything. The meat looks good and tastes good. ?We like the sides: ?German potato salad and burnt baked beans. ?They are generous with the buns. And the guy who cuts up the meat (twice we were there, it's the same guy), he is nice, polite, chill. ?Not a hipster at all. ?Thank goodness! Toughest part about dining at Fette Sau is not about making up your mind what to order. ?Toughest past about dining at Fette Sau is about getting a table when you have your food! ?You can see some people there potentially getting into a quarrel over a table and I am not kidding. ?The wait in line is long (at least 20 minutes) and by the time you get your food, all you want to do is sit down and eat! ?But more often than not, getting that table is very challenging to the point of being frustrating.

this is really gooood bbq! worth the train ride from mahattan and walking those creepy streets it works like this: you order the meat by the weight and some sides then pay. there's a separate counter for drinks. tables are first come, first serve. if you're from hawaii skip the pulled pork-- it tastes just like kalua but w/o the smoke. the brisket, though, is insane and the ribs are just as good so be sure to order those (esp the brisket-- it was sooo tender!) we also ordered the sausage but i didn't care for it. ?we didn't have room for the pork belly but that's ok, we can get the korean kine in hawaii too, lol! a modest tray set us back $40 but it was worth every bite and we had a side of beans (it wasn't my favorite-- very strong tasting and more on the salty side) and german potato salad. the potato salad was crazy good though and i could have eaten another serving but i was just too full! we were lucky-- went on a drizzly day so there wasn't a line but it did get packed once we left. go early so you can get a table.

I live nearby, and so this is my go-to spot for BBQ. ?Let's do this in list form, shall we? Pros: - BEST tasting BBQ I've had in NYC---and I've been to Hill Country, various Brother Jimmy's, and Dallas BBQ. - Fair cost, considering the quality. ?I usually get 1/3 lbs of pulled pork, which comes to $6, including 2-3 Hawaiian rolls. - Nice, casual atmosphere: no waiters to worry about, just order at the counter and sit your ass down! Cons: - Sides are expensive, relatively speaking. - Gets very, very crowded at times (but that's not Fette Sau's fault). I usually wind up spending $12-15 for a meal here, since I often go with friends and we all get large-order sides to share. Top notch, overall! ?Oh, and the sauces are effing awesome.

I've never had any problem with staff being surly. They have always been nice to me. Sometimes the pulled pork is really, really dry and I have heard the same about the brisket. If they could get that under control and get some good side dishes (there is nothing here for any veg-people you rope into coming with you), this place would be complete. Beautiful room and bar and in the summer it's fun to drink beer outside, but man, get some good SIDES please! Please?

Fette Sau, on Metropolitan Avenue in Williamsburg comes courtesy of Kim and Joe Carroll. The name means 'fat pig' in German and quite an apt description of how you feel after a meal here. The former garage space itself is a gem and the owners wisely kept the industrial look, leaving pipes exposed and the cinder block walls intact. There isn't much in terms of decor except for the beef and pork chart drawings that fill one side of the wall. The kitchen, dominated by the massive Southern Pride gas and wood smoker, turns out brisket, pork ribs, sirloin, pork belly, and the like, all dry rubbed. Only pork and beef is served and even the sides make it clear that Fette Sau is not intended for those with vegetarian preferences. Try to come early for the best cuts and also to avoid a lengthy wait as the communal picnic tables fill up quickly especially during the winter months. The ribs, pork belly, and steak are what you should be coming here for but always eye the meat once you reach the counter. And come thirsty. With Kim and Joe Carroll's previous experience with their first venture Spuyten Duyvil, it's no surprise that Fette Sau's bar is remarkable in itself. The local brews poured into jam jars and growlers pair well with the meal but it's the impressive list of American whiskies that will make you pay attention. So if you're still complaining of New York's lack of good barbecue, head to Williamsburg and be persuaded otherwise.

Do I have to be a barbecue connoisseur to write write a review for this place? Do I have to know about sauce and heat? Nope. All I have to have are taste buds. Someone ?said this is the best BBQ in NYC, I wanted to stuff my face, rub my belly and shake my head as my hand could not stop feeding my mouth but that was not the case! I had to reluctantly force the fork to my mouth. My taste buds were not impressed. Tepid meat, odd tasting sausage. Pork belly was acceptable. I don't care about price. I'll pay $18 for a pound of meat but it better be some damned good meat. The sauces were watery and sour. OK, last part and I will give some leeway on this since this isn't what you go to a BBQ joint for. DO NO GET THE BROCCOLI SALAD or the German Potato salad. The broccoli salad was like eating cold, sour mildewy towels. And the BUN! The bun was a small hot dog bun not cornbread. Injustice to BBQ. Done. That is my review for Fette Sau. Seriously, Dinosaur BBQ is more satisfying.

OK...So I came in with a friend one afternoon...I loved the atmosphere...Great music (Talking Heads)...Stood in line and decided I wanted a taste of a few things...Pork Belly, Beef Ribs and Brisket...Came out to more than I was hoping to spend...But what do you expect in this hip neighborhood? ?The food itself was pretty good...I enjoyed the Pork Belly the most...They weigh your food which I found kind of annoying...This place must make an absolute killing...I saw people spending 80 dollars for like 2 people and it really was not that much food...I understand BBQ can be labor intensive, but come on...Sauces were OK...Nothing special...If you are a whiskey drinker, they have a nice selection...Side dishes are kind of lacking in my opinion...I had fun though...Don't know if I will be back soon though...

I will say this place is ok, not bad. I would go back there if is no waiting. Everybody seems like the beans but I thought the beans was too sweet. The roll tasted like regular grocery store potato bread. I didn't see anything special about this place.

Do me now. This is some of the best BBQ in the city. May i recommend the baked beans, pork belly and brisket along with a full order of pickles? Wash it down with a bourbon flight and you've got a good night. Recommended to get there before 7 or so as meat will start to run out as will the on-your-own seating.

Went last week with friends and we had a great time. We ordered family style and all the meats tasted delicious. My favorite was the smoked pork... yum! The sauces were phenomenal and added just the right amount of kick. Tried a lager and I wish I could remember the name because it paired very well with our meal. ?I will definitely return!

the best BBQ that i've had in a long time. family style, wooden benches. came on a busy Monday night, and it was raining. squeezed in at the end of a wooden table with a pound of pulled pork and some broccoli salad (really good, by the way). slathered my meat in sauce. the three of us (all girls) ordered a gallon of beer and swirled it until the very last drop. at this point, we were having an excellent time, sopping wet from the rain, faces stained with barbecue sauce. this is a fantastic idea.

I went on a Thursday night with a friend and the place was packed at 7 PM. ?The pork shoulder and pork belly were excellent ? The brisket was top notch. ?Coupled with baked beans (a little sweet for me) and pickles and broccoli we had a barbecue balanced meal. We ate at the bar and tried several of the local beers. ?Afterwards we tried numerous of the American whiskeys. ?Dave, the bartender, was cool and really knowledgeable. ? It is the type of place where you can talk with other patrons freely. ?Not a pickup place. ?I had an interesting conversation about rye with the woman to my left who was waiting for her boyfriend.

went on a quiet night none of the obscene line i've heard about didn't know much about this place so was pleasantly surprised by the set up and concept ordered with a limited menu as they ran out of some things-sat with mounds of meat- hit or miss per type: ribs- a ok brisket- a bit luke warm not much q-crisp pulled pork- not happening tasted like it sat for awhile baked beans- ehh all in all alright but not spectacular as most reviews raved on a side note to the atmoshpere- seems like we are in the era of AH (after hipsters), where quasi-hipster is synonymous with being a sh*thead from the midwest

This may be my favorite restaurant in NYC. Every time i come here i buy more meat than i could ever handle. Everything they cook here is ridiculously tender and practically melts in your mouth. And everything is dry-rub, which is a big plus. And the menu also changes everyday depending on the animal they get which is pretty awesome. The ribs are very flavorful and fall right of bone.The brisket unlike anything you're ever had. Its so tender you would swear you're biting into fish and the fat makes it twice as good. its nice and smokey and literally melts in your mouth. The pork belly is fatty and delicious and you wont find better anywhere else. The beef ribs are nice and juicy too. The sides are decent the best side they do in my opinion is the potato salad. The baked beans are a too burnt for my taste. The thing that compliments everything else the best is the bread. The atmosphere does a good job of making you feel at home as you eat pounds and pounds food. The place is pretty pricey since they charge around $20 per pound for almost everything but it is definitely worth it. This is hands down the best BBQ in NYC and definitely one of the best restaurants around. It is a must for anyone that even slightly enjoys BBQ food.

Fette Sau has amazing meat! ?Their barbecue is outstanding but they have NO good sides. ?It is really such a shame, when you compare it to someplace like Diasy May's, where you are hard pressed trying to pick two out of so many wonderful options. Overall, Fette Sau is a healthier option, but I left feeling like something was missing. ?If they could add a few tasty side options, this place would definitely get 4 or 5 stars. Also, the atmosphere is a bit pretentious, but I'm not one to really pay attention to those around me when I am happily eating.

Probably the greatest BBQ I've ever had. ?Fatty, greasy, incredibly unhealthy, these are compliments, and don't let it get cold or you'll notice all these things; instead, wrap the brisket in pork belly or chew contemplatively on beef cheeks. ?For traditionalists, they had the best straight-up pork chops I've ever had. ?The sides kind of suck (stick to potato chips) [update: I've come around on the potato salad] but they always have a great beer selection (often having something like the Sly Fox Rauchbier or the Chelsea Dark Wheat or Sixpoint Vienna Pale that nobody else has), and their bourbon selection is absurd. ?Because you buy the food by the quarter pound you can actually eat here rather cheaply, but it's best when you get a ton of different things to share. ?Go early. ?If you get there at 5pm you'll waltz right through and you're going to need those extra hours to digest anyway, spend them across the street at Spuyten Duyvil (owned by the same people). ? Apparently one day a month they now do a pig roast where they smoke and sell the whole pig by the quarter pound. ?The whole pig. ?You can try smoked pig eyeballs!!!

I think I had too high expectations for fette sau because of all of the hype about it lately in the media. it was good,but not amazing. Sides were great, and the majority of the meat choices were good (brisket was a bit dry), but i found the sausage links to be boring. You order the meat and side by the pound. The line can be long (we waited about 40 minutes)but thank goodness, they sell giant jugs of beer- which makes the wait much more standable. Would I go again? Yes, for NYC, best bbq I have had (beating out Dinosaur by a little).

I dont usually write reviews, but Fette Sau needs some describing here for us bbq lovers looking for a good meal. If you like fatty fatty brisket, tough, dry, fatty, oversalted ribs, broccoli that is cold and vinegary and full of unknown spicey spices, wonder bread, rude service, dirty dirty environment that appears as if they took over a car garage but did not have time to do much cleaning first, no visible menu, waiting in long lines that crowd the doorway, loud loud bad acoustics that make it impossible to hear, darkness so dark that for all you really know you have just been served dog food, this is the place for you. Oh, and dont expect to sit down. but, if you love whiskey, and you drink enough of theirs, all of the above will be more than bearable.

BBQ at it's best! Growlers and a great beer selection def put this place at a 5 star rating. Only draw back is the joint's popularity...seating is luck of the draw and if you come with more than 4 people it's gonna be tough finding a spot inside. Don't let the crowded atmosphere deter you from going...the brisket, sausages, pickles and sauces is worth the wait

Ok, I dont even like meat that much, and I liked this place. I was horribly concerned when the two guys I was with said "here it is" and all i see is an alley way next to a car repair store of some sort. But as we got closer, I saw the adorable interior and my concerns were diminished. I don't love meat, so I just had some of my beau's while the boys stocked up, trying everything. Everything I tried was excellent--the coleslaw was delicious. I was expecting standard deli style coleslaw, but this was made with big chunks of everything, and was just really great. And beer is decently priced too! All in all, an awesome find.

What else can be said that 379 reviewers before me said? This place is like nothing else I had ever seen. Outstanding barbecue tucked away in some shady looking alley way. Very strange but it's perfect for this area and I mean that in a good way. I instantly fell in love with this place and you could smell it from 2 blocks away. Nothing beats the smell of smoked meat. Well, maybe bacon but this was even better. Bottom line, the brisket. The brisket is so juicy and smoky and just perfect. Everything is delicious here. Just look at all these pictures my fellow Yelpers posted for this fine establishment. You'll understand what it's all about. Did I mention the brisket? that's what I'm talking about people!!

Speaking from a person that does not eat that much meat (I was taken with a group), this place does its menu well. That said, I could do without smelling like the smoked meat long after I'd left ... they could also make seating less of a mosh pit but I guess that's part of the appeal for most.

Went here during Thanksgiving weekend and, man, it was a perfect spot for great dry-rub bbq. For myself, I ordered a 1/3 lb of each: Pork Belly, St. Louis style ribs, and brisket...and for my sides I got...that's right, more pig: pork skins and sausages. It was a pretty epic lunch. Pork belly was easily my favorite. Dry rub had great flavor and all the meat was perfectly smoked. Sauces were all awesome too, though one was a little too smokey for me. The restaurant had a perfect environment: Picnic tables is how you should eat bbq and I also enjoyed how each bar tap had knives for handles...beer was also very good and it was served in a jar...that's certainly a plus...Came out crazy stuffed, so it was a long walk to the subway...but who cares, it was uber delish.

I am on the fence about Fette Sau. ?On the plus side, it is a hearty, affordable meal in a laid-back place. ?On the negative side, I wasn't a huge fan of some of the BBQ. ?The brisket was super tender, but I didn't think it had a ton of flavor on its own (you had to dip it in extra sauce). ?The pork belly was kind of tough and charred - very different from any pork belly I've ever eaten, and not really in a good way. ?I LOVED the potato salad, and I also really liked the pickles. ?I'm not a BBQ expert or anything, but my husband (who has TX and GA roots) was really not a fan. ?I don't think we'll be returning during subsequent NYC visits, especially since it requires a trip out to Brooklyn.

Finally ate at Fette Sau which was supposed to be the next best thing to being in Texas. ?It was ok. ?I don't get how a place that is supposed to have BBQ winds up with NO PORK RIBS on any given day. ?They didn't have any when I went...so that stinks for me. ?Needless to say I had half pound of brisket and half pound of beef rib, some baked beans, and a sausage. ?None of it was impressive. I expected SMOKE, there was none. ?I expected flavor....again...not really. The sauces on the table were ok...nothing great. ?To top off all of this was the fact that it cost me 40 BUCKS! ?For a pound of meat and a sausage, beans and a bottle of water? ?Tell ya what New York....the BBQ in NYC SUCKS in general. ?If you don't have a grill to smoke meat at home, then just forget it. Or at least go to a place that doesn't pretend to be REAL and has lots of tasty sauce, plus find a place that is decently priced. ?BBQ is supposed to be cheap meat cooked SLOW so it gets tender and yummy!

I think the brisket might be better here than Hill Country....that is, the freshly cooked shanks looked better - but our pieces were still a little dry (we got a different piece of meat). ?Kudos that the meats are organic, they offer lamb shanks and pork cheeks (I don't know which cheek :) ?but it's good. ?Also got a pork rib which was great. ?Negatives are the sides are a little week (less choice and just not as good as Hill Country), and operations are terrible - one guy cutting all the meat - so expect to wait a long time if you go peak times. ?Prices are about comparable with Hill Country if not slightly more.

i cannot award less than 3 stars because the food is so good, but GET A NEW BARTENDER. we literally stopped drinking because the bartender was so awful, and subsequently left. my husband stood at a near empty bar for 15 minutes and was ignored by this d-bag. whenever my husband tried to get his attention, he put his hand up and said "just a second" really rudely. so obviously we did not stick around. also, they need to keep these tables moving. people need somewhere to sit and eat!

After Matt Lang won "Best In Smoke" on the Food Network I figured I had to try this place. ?I headed in there with the in-laws and wife. ?When it was clear that we had not ever eaten there before, the guy at the meat counter asked us if there was anything we didn't like and how many people we were feeding. ?He piled the meat-- pork ribs, pork belly, brisket, beef ribs, pulled pork, and sweet sausage -- and sides (potato salad, slaw, beans) on the tray and off we went. ?The pulled pork was excellent ?three different ways: undressed, with the vinegar based sauce, and with the house sauce. ?Moist, well seasoned, ?and not too salty. ?The beef ribs were excellent, again moist, well seasoned, and not too salty. ?The sausage was quite good by itself, but excellent when enhanced with the house sauce. ?The pork belly was tender and flavorful. ?The brisket was nicely seasoned and tasty, but somewhat dry. ?But on this particular day, the brass ring was the pork ribs: ?moist, well seasoned, not too salty, falling off the bone (are you sensing a trend?), and especially tasty when enhanced with the house sauce. ?I have learned from another yelp reviewer that generally the sides may not be the highlight of a bbq place, but in this case, the three that we had were solid deliveries. For a slightly different opinion, my wife thought the beef ribs were the best followed by the pulled pork and the sausage. The house sauce did a great job of enhancing everything on the table. ?The vinegar sauce was excellent on the pulled pork. ?The mustard was good on the sausage (but the house sauce better). ?The mustard was quite similar to chinese hot mustard. Overall, some of the best BBQ I have had and definitely worth the trip. ?I'll return.

The bbq is decent. There were five of us which came out to be about 97 dollars. The food was more than enough for the five of us. It's a good place to go when you feel the need for a lot of meat, but you might get a little grossed out. Not a bad place. A bit hard to find a table, might have to hover and share tables. Oh they also have beer by the gallon ;)

Came here earlier tonight around 8pm & it was pretty crowded. Tables went pretty fast & you kinda have to fight for it which I'm good at so no problems there. The food is reasonably priced, I had a little bit of everything. The baked beans are wonderful, on the sweeter side; so is the BBQ sauce. The potato salad isn't done with mayonnaise & refrigerated so expect it to be cold. This is the kind of place where you leave gaining at least 5 pounds & reeking of BBQ in your hair/clothes. Dress casual & be prepared to get messy, restaurant has a farm-barn feel to it in a unexpected area. Prices are reasonable, I would definitely go again & recommend it. Yay! Def. a fan :)

Maybe it was off night but my boyfriend and I both sampled various items from Fette Sau and went home very sick. I found that the meat was pretty dried out which is not a good thing. There were a number of sauces that were available but I was shocked to see that they didn't have mashed potatoes or macaroni and cheese which is quite a shock when you think about the fact that it's supposed to be a BBQ place. According to my boyfriend, the pork is from Berkshire which is organic meat which was our initial reason to come here. I really liked the idea of having this family style restaurant and enjoyed the beers - but was sad to see that that was all that I took away from this experience. Maybe this was an off night; however, the place was packed.

Gigantic metal trays filled with all sorts of delicious meat products. Yeah... that sounds like something I'd be into. - When we first arrived, though I had been warned, I was surprised at how many people were in line to get their BBQ on. The whole place was very informal. Basically get in line, grab your meat, find a place to chow down. - Fette Sau was a former auto-body repair shop and some of the traces from its past are still evident. What was once the drive-way is now filled with picnic tables and the interior is fashioned out of old wood-beams and cement. They even have some seating that is fashioned from John Deere tractor seats. - We had a pretty large group, so while some of us sat at a table and drank, the second group stood in line to get the meat and drank as well. I was a big fan of the bar set-up, which was pretty killer... literally. They had a great selection of whiskey and an nice selection of beers on tap. What caught my attention, and I guess most people who visit, was that all the tap handles crafted from knives and other sharp instruments used to gut and prep delicious beasties. Apparently one of the cooks lost his finger in the meat grinder the night before. Now I don't know if it's true or what, but someone was apparently missing some finger. That's the story I heard from one of our crew and you just gotta love a story like that coming from a place like this. - When our line crew arrived back at the table, they had (2) huge trays full of meat and other goodies. Sausage, pulled pork, brisket, pork belly, baked beans, coleslaw and huge dinner roles. All the fixings you need for a well planned heart attack. The brisket was pretty good, but I was all over the pork belly that evening. Definitely order that pork belly. Everything was really enjoyable, but it wasn't the best BBQ I'd ever tasted. That's what I was told it would be, but I think it's the hype, style of service, close quarters and over-all atmosphere that really makes this place unique. I would definitely venture out there again for some more pork belly.

There are many days when I wake up and CRAVE this place. The sausage, the pulled pork, the beans, the tater salad. The ROLLS! The divine vinegar-y sauces. I wish this place delivered. I wish this place was down the block. I wish no one else knew about it, because the line is frigging ridiculous (easily the worst thing about it). I want to marry this place.

It's a lot like Hill Country, except poorly executed. ?Counter service can be done very effectively, but the way Fette Sau does it is the complete opposite of that. ?There's one guy at one counter whose job is to take your order, cut and weigh your meat, make the list of what you ordered for the cashier, and dispense some of the sides. ?Then there's another guy who dispenses the rest of the sides, and a cashier. ?And that's it. ?No wonder the lines get really long! ?(For comparison, at the meat counter of Hill Country alone, there's three people taking orders at weekend dinner hours, plus five or six people whose job is to cut the meat.) As a result, though we arrived fairly early (~6:30 on a Saturday), we waited in line for almost an hour. ?That's just ridiculous. ?They need more people back there dividing up labor in some way. All that being said, the food ranged from good (the pulled pork, the pork sausage, the brisket) to excellent (the beef tongue pastrami, the lamb shank, the baked beans). ?There's also quite a good selection of tap beers (using butcher's implements as tap handles is a nice touch) and whiskeys. So if you like BBQ, it's definitely worth a try, but don't expect to be in and out in a short period of time. ?If you can manage it, get there closer to when they open (5pm) and I'd guess the wait will be shorter than we experienced.

As a snobby Manhattanite, I rarely venture to Brooklyn to dine, but Fette Sau made the trip well worth it. The food was so good I ate as much as my stomach could take. The brisket was well seasoned and moist, and the sausage was the best I've had in a while. Pork ribs were solid, while the pulled pork was juicy and the best I've had in a while. Baked beans were a hit and complimented the meat well. I really liked the beer...I wish I can remember what it was called though.

Went here with some out-of-town guests for a week night dinner. ?Yum. ?We had the spare ribs, some beef, pulled pork, one sausage (just to taste), the beans, pickles, a key lime pie and the delicious rolls. ?We ate it all family style (we noticed that some patrons opted to order their own stuff, on their own tray). ?To drink, half of us drank the rye and the other two drank some of the locally-bottled sodas. ?The meats were great. ?On one hand, I liked that we could add our sauces but, on the other hand, wish that the chef could have made the sauce + meat pairing for us. ?The little pie was amazing. ?I really enjoyed the decor. ?You sit communally at long, wooden tables. ?I would definitely come back here.

I won't mince words. It's good barbecue. It's slightly over-priced. ?It's good beer. It's slightly over-priced. ?Williamsburg is a little trendy, and watching cute skinny hipster chicks goring themselves on meat is kind of $*&#ing awesome. ?I recommend the Liquid Gold by Captain Lawrence Brewing Co. ?As far as the sides go, the beans are great, and the pickles are good.... the rest? Nothing to see here folks. ?I've ordered the brisket a couple times and had it cut long and stringy rather than against the grain (a huge no, no that makes the meat seem tougher and less enjoyable). ?In the NYC BBQ scheme of things I'd put it below Dinosaur and R.U.B., and before Daisy May's... right about on par with Hill Country, maybe even a tad better than.

So overhyped. Expected a mouth of full blast flavor and gluttonous overindulgence but I just ended up forcing myself to finish things. One thing I will say, the beans are amazing. The pork belly was also very good. However, everything else I found was a little dry or missing that BAMM-southern flavor. Yes the cafeteria thing is cool. Yes, beer out of jars is oh so cool...

The place was packed. And I can see why! You get simple BBQ with immense flavor. Our group got the duck, brisket, pulled pork and veal.

The food and atmosphere was great... my complaint is the seating situation. I don't mind communal sitting, I do mind having other patrons 'hold' their spot at a table while their friend is in the back of the line... where I could probably sit in their place, eat my delicious ribs/sausage, and finish before their friend gets up to the front of the line. Is that necessarily Fette Sau's fault? No...but I'm rating my overall experience. Any place where you still smell like a barbeque five hours later is a quality establishment.

I really loved this place. The smoked in-house dry-rub meat selection was in one word "awesome"! Also liked the atmosphere (no pretension with communal, picnic table seating), with focus just being on gluttony eating. Had cuts of pulled pork, ribs, berkshire belly (bacon), and brisket. Complimented this all American BBQ tradition with several bourbons including Hudson Baby Bourbon (first distilled ?bourbon whiskey in NY!) and Four Roses Single Barrel Straight Bourbon . Word of caution: Once you try Fette Sau, other BBQs in NYC will pale in comparison!!!

This place is the bomb, I went with 3 amigos, we had the brisket, ribs, duck, baked beans, coleslaw, and a gallon of beer, we spent about 35 each and left super satisfied, this food is amazing. I think next time I'll get brisket only, as it was my favorite. Absolutely get the beans. Didnt try the potato salad but will next time. They charge you by the pound, a little pricey but worth it. Would have been 5 stars if not for the slow line, they need to have two lines or something to keep it moving faster, other than that I am definitely going back for seconds. and thirds. and, you get the idea.

The best BBQ in New York. The pork belly is unmatched for flavor, texture and just fatty, porky goodness. The sausages are my daughter's favorites. The ribs, brisket and occasional pastrami are all delicious. Pulled pork is good but not quite up to the same standard. ?For side dishes, the beans are very tasty and the broccoli salad looks limp and bland but has great texture and flavor. My favorite is to sit at the bar (on recycled vintage tractor seats), eat delicious food and taste some unusual American whiskies and beers. Only complaint is that they no longer have my favorite beer on tap (Six Point Righteous Rye). Also, when they do fat pig Thursdays, bbqing up a whole hog, it's a unique pleasure. You've never had pork cracklings or jowls like these unless you've been to a good BBQ joint in the Carolinas.

Omg. Yum. My boyfriend and I don't care what it takes to get there, or how long the wait could possibly be, we will pretty much do anything to eat here if the opportunity shows itself. The brisket is really unbelievable and every other meat they serve there is to die for as well. You wait in a communal food line, they serve you your delicious BBQ on a baking sheet, and the seating is first come first served. There is a separate bar, so if there is a wait for food, I like to send someone for beer while we wait in line. Seats turn over but you really have to scope out territory. They have sides, baked beans which are delicious, potato salad, sour kraut etc. But the meat, brisket, ribs, sausage, pulled pork mmmmmmm.... It's so good you end up eating only that. I love this place worth going especially to BillyBurg for.

I got the pork belly and my hubby got the brisket. We also got some pickles, beans and broccoli salad. Everything was amazing. The pork belly won the night but really everything was absolutely delicious. And, pretty cheap. My husband's dinner cost about $10 and mine cost about $18 because I bought all the sides.

I came here with a group of about 8 people for a pre-birthday party dinner. If you can hover and snag a table, it's great for groups. A gallon of beer will only set you back about 30 bucks, and we each had 2-3 beers so it was a great deal. You order food by weight (quarter pound, half pound, etc.) so sharing is very practical, especially since you'll want to try a little of everything. Best pork ribs I've had outside of the south and all of the sides are delicious - try the pickles and coleslaw! The BBQ staff is patient and kind (there's a lot to choose from!) and the bar staff is knowledgable (and good looking!). You'll leave with your hair/clothes smelling a little like smokey BBQ, but Ladies, if you're barhopping afterwards in South Williamsburg I'm pretty sure that will only help you attract bearded men in plaid.

Every time I walk to the register after having ordered, I'm always shocked at how not as expensive the total turned out to be. The meats are super tasty. Every now and then, the brisket can be dry. However, 8 out of 10 times, it's juicy and on point! I usually get broc, potatoes, and beans on the side. Great place for a big group, but go early or late because they do get busy and seating can be tricky! Bar's pretty great. I suggest going to Spuytin Duyvil afterwards. This was the first place I went to after deciding I couldn't be a vegetarian any longer... Totally worth it.

Okay...I know people always caveat their reviews with where they are from to give their reviews more of a sense of legitimacy. I am doing that now as I tell you that I am a native Texan who (when home) frequents Blacks, Smitty's, Kreuz's, and Coopers for BBQ. ? ? ? With that behind us now, let me comment on Fette Sau. I went for my birthday and splurged. We had brisket, pulled pork, beef ribs, and sausage. I asked for the brisket to be cut from the lean end and they didn't cut it from the lean end for me, which kind of turned me off. However, it was juicy and had solid flavor. The pulled pork was great when we went. The beef ribs were pretty good and had some decent bark. The sausage was not good in my opinion. I didn't like the "Italian" flavored spices (sorry, I don't know what exactly they were). I also didn't like that the meat was kept warm in a glass case with heat lamps. I guess I am so used to seeing the lid on the pit opened before my meat comes off that a glass case with meat inside made me worry a bit. ? ? ? The sides ROCKED! I ate the burnt end baked beans and they were the best beans I have ever had in my life. If I ever went back to Fette Sau I would potentially just get a bit pot of beans and skip the meat. ? ? ? There were four sauces to put on your meat. I don't really do sauces so I can't really comment authoritatively on them but I did like what I tried. ? ? ? For BBQ in NYC it's the best I've tried and if I have a hankering in the near future, that is where I will go (unless I can get to Wilson's Holy Smoke BBQ in Connecticut).

Came here for the second time yesterday and it's definitely one of the most memorable meals ive had in awhile. I don't know if BBQ is like drinking fine wine and these connoisseurs who are reviewing have problems with the food here based on some refined sense that I do not possess, or if I happened to hit on an especially good day... but between the ribs, brisket, bacon, rolls and variety of sauces I couldn't have been better served. They have a good section of beers on tap and nice bartenders who know their stuff and are happy to chat with you about their beer and whiskey selections. This is the perfect hangover food spot to indulge in BBQ bliss and throw back a few micro brews.

Braved the L train and came over here for some good Q / wasn't necesarally blown away but I wasn't disapointed either. Stick with the standard stuff : ribs / pulled pork / brisket. ?Sometimes they have experimental stuff : ?Some good / some not what I thought it should have been... hey it was experimental so fair is fair. Good bread & the sides are ok. ?( beans are standout with bit's of fatback and meat ) ? Note : they cut on the fatty side / I'm not a fan - you're either on the lean cut or the fatty cut side of the fence. ? I'm on the leaner side... just my preference. Our butcher ( chef? ) happily adjusted his cut and all was good. Bar - huge selection of bourbon, priced as you would expect for a bar located in : Manhattan. ?Downside is that they pour measured shots... which has this very cheap feeling, I mean, come on here. We're paying full ride prices and you're metering? Hummm... note the short tip I give and it sucked a star out of your review for it. Tables - prepare to scope and act fast / recommend coming during off times...

I really can't tell you how much it pains me to give Fette Sau only 3 stars. I really do love this place. Sure seating is a pain in the ass, but they have an awesome beer selection, american whiskey selection and the food is (was...) fantastic. To be clear, I've eaten here many, many times, and if I were writing this review a year ago, it would get 5 stars. But something changed. I've noticed many people talking about this place being over-hyped, coming in with high expectations and being disappointed. Let me assure you, every glowing recommendation you've heard about this place was true at the time. But something changed. The Beef Brisket. The holy grail of BBQ. And Fette Sau had the best (in my opinion). When I first started coming, the brisket was insanely moist and flavorful, I almost couldn't handle it. It was incredible. I immediately told everyone that would listen all about it (sorry for contributing to the line...) But time went by and I didn't go as much, but still recommended it. I heard from a friend one day that the brisket was dry. I was baffled, but figured everyone has an off night. I went back with a group a friends, and sure enough, dry brisket. Being madly in love with this place, I figured everyone has 2 off nights. I went back a few weeks later and sure enough, to my disappointment, dry brisket. My heart is broken. Dear Fette Sau, I implore you, whatever spell you changed in your brisket-wizardry book, please change it back. The brisket is dry now, and it used to be the best. Btw, the Pork and Beans remain absolutely amazing, the pulled pork is fantastic, sausage links are great, and pretty much the whole menu rocks. Just bring back that amazing beef brisket.

Maybe I'm just bitter that my brother's friends decided this was a good place to take my (vegetarian) brother, but I think the real reason I don't like this place is that they charged $8, after tax, for a half-cup of cold broccoli "salad", and $4 for about three tablespoons of potato salad, ditto for the tea-cup of baked beans. I was supposed to get some rolls with mine, but didn't (although I managed to get my hands on some later). We ate outside next to a group of Eastern Europeans, which was cool, but a little music would have alleviated the feeling of trespassing in someone's yard. While the food I had was good, there's no way this place is getting above two stars at those ridiculous prices.

Hands down the best bbq i've had in nyc. Go with a group and order a couple pounds of meat, a couple gallons of beer (yes they sell beer by the gallon), and grab a table outside if you can. Tends to get very crowded, so try to go early (or late) if u can. Also has a limited late-night menu for the end of a night out (mmm, pork sliders :).

Cafeteria style BBQ in Brooklyn, NY with great beer and bourbon. ?Fette Sau is located off Metropolitan Ave in Williamsburg. ?Their brisket is excellent, sides are good. ?Ribs are very good. ?Other things to eat include sausage, ham, "berkshire belly", all of which I need to try sometime in the future. ?I liked that I was able to was down the yummy bbq with local beer from Captain Lawrence, Sixpoint, Kelso, or some other offerings.

WARNING: This post will be a bit biased, as I am a vegetarian, reviewing a BBQ restaurant. First off, you may be asking, "If she is a vegetarian, why in the world, of all the meat-free spots in Williamsburg, does this gal choose a BBQ joint?" I had a friend coming in from Boston to visit. He eats meat. A lot of it. He competes in BBQ cook-offs and sometimes even wins. Boston doesn't have good BBQ. Fette Sau does. Now that that is cleared up... I ended up ordering every single side. He ordered every single meaty thing possible (give him a break. He's tired of Bostonian French cuisine.) The potato salad was really good (not too mayo-y), as was the broccoli, which was basted in really great herbs. He raved about the pork belly, and even took photos of it to make his dad jealous. (Yet no photos of me. What am I- chopped liver? Granted, he probably WOULD have taken photos of chopped liver.) Anyway. They have some fun soda flavors in bottles- orange cream, sarsaparilla, espresso, etc. Tried a couple of those, but ultimately ended up drinking a lot of whiskey. Good whiskey. In an area that typically only serves PBR, I was very surprised to see what all they had to offer at the bar. I would come here again solely for drinks, actually. All in all, if you like BBQ, come here. I've lived in Texas and I know just how big a deal good BBQ is, and if you're a Southern transplant, I definitely would recommend this to you to get your messy, greasy, fatty fix.

Very expensive, very well done meat, including perhaps the best smoked sausage I have ever had at a bbq joint, including in Texas. Really, really, really AWFUL side dishes. ?A cole slaw that is a bit too homestyle and has sesame oil. ?It looked and tasted like lo mein that had been thrown up previously. ?The beans were horrible. ?They tasted burnt and were five bucks for a small cup. ? For me, its about both the meats and the sides. Perhaps if they made normal side dishes it would be better, but I would ride the train to Dinosaur or eat at RUB. Maybe get take out, but make your own sides..

Love Fette Sau. It's all about the meat. Depending on what they've been able to procure the ribs - when they have them - come in two styles. The one they always had on hand when I first started eating there were more of a dry rub, not saucy, fall off the bone and melt in your mouth variety. The other style is more the classic variety, saucy, my Grandmother likes to make. Equally good and equally different style wise. Other recommendations: the veal sausage, man is it good; and the pork chops. The pulled pork is just fine. No doubt this joint would rate 4 stars, if you could get some good sides. You can't. It's too bad, cause that's the only thing separating it from BBQ greatness.

"Fat swine" in German, credit the German immigrants in Texas for inventing the best BBQ in the country. This place follows this tradition, and results in some of the most succulent pork belly, ribs, and sausages I have ever tasted. The best BBQ in the world may be in Texas, but this place keeps it authentic. Also great local beers and excellent whiskey!

Oh the whiskey list! As a fledgling whiskey connoisseur, Fette Sau offers quite the variety of some of the best American bourbon whiskeys in NYC: George T. Stagg, and all the Pappy Van Winkle's. ? They offer all kinds of whiskey flights in triplets and gallons of beer too. In terms of the meat ?... lord, my husband nearly lost his mind! Suffice it to say that if you like bbq in any way this place is heaven! Obviously this place is a must try. But be sure to arrive very EARLY or about 11pm-ish because the picnic table style seating is first-come-first-serve and you'll have an hour wait or more otherwise. It's usually a little disorganized and people are kind of all over the place so there seems to be no line but there is. Beware the cutters! They exist and some will even conveniently feign ignorance and take your seat(s) if you're not paying attention! You can eat at the bar area too but the seats, albeit cute, are really uncomfortable to sit on. They REALLY need to have a railing or something to allow for people to prop up their legs. The prices are reasonable and the crowd is laid-back, relaxed, and very friendly. Be prepared to spend about $35 per person on a nice amount of food, which includes a couple of sides and big portion of meat(s). The drinks are also very reasonably priced so the additional amount you'll have to spend just depends on how much of a lush you are ;)

I am in love with this dim, pretend German castle dining hall that you can smell from a block and a half away. ?Where else can you go for insanely good, super cheap sausage and a good wine list? ?Or brisket and a knockout selection of whiskey? ?With a bunch of crazy long rough-hewn communal wooden tables and benches and dark wood timbers, *and* great beers on tap, AND free range meats? ?Nowhere. ?That's why you can't find a seat when you get there.

An unpretentious palace of meat.

It flavors the air with good smells, fills the neighborhood with good vibes, and brings out the best in the locals. A+.

I had been wanting to eat at Fette Sau for a long while and I finally made my way there a few weeks ago. ?I went at what seemed to be a lull in the dinner rush, so I didn't have to wait very long in line. ? We ordered the boneless beef ribs and the pork ribs. ?Everything had a yummy crust on it, and the boneless beef ribs were particularly tender. ?At the counter all the meat looked great, and choosing was hard, so I am definitely planning on going back and trying the rest out. ?We also had one of the sausages, which was excellent. ?It was juicy and perfect when paired with a beer. The ambiance was just what we were looking for on a nice night, we sat outside at on of the picnic tables and enjoyed the weather. ?Very laid back establishment with seriously good food. ?I'm looking forward to going back.

Ok - I'm a fan of Hill Country (having a $300 gift certificate there makes it oh-so-easy to be a fan) so I wasn't expecting much competition from Fette Sau. However, there are some ways in which Fette Sau definitely trumps Hill Country-- (1) the ambiance is much more chilled-out and homey, despite the indoor area almost having a warehouse kind of feel, (2) the BEANS were ridiculously good: meaty, smokey, rich, spicy, everything baked beans should be but never really are, (3) the pork belly was better than absolutely anything on the Hill Country menu-- yes, even the fatty brisket there. However, I can't give this place 5 stars because many of the other meats we ordered (beef ribs, beef brisket, and the porkribs) were just okay, nothing to write home about. Other pros of this place-- very cool and unique bar with great selections, pretty unique style in terms of eating off trays, etc. Although the crowd was not even remotely racially diverse, there was a bit of diversity in terms of age and group characteristics when I was there, which was nice. I liked that the beer was served in jars, with options to purchase entire gallons or 1/2 gallons as well. A distilled recommendation: check it out if you're around, get the beans and the pork belly, and throw back a few beers. You won't regret it.

Pork belly was off the chain. Put in their fresh baked biscuit, some sauerkraut, and their sauce = Thee Best. The potato salad wasn't very good, it had an odd plastic-y taste but that was the only miss. Baked beans, win; multiple beers on tap, win; fireplace app burning nicely, super win. The communal seating was nice, except for people mad sweating you over to get a space. Fette Sau was a great restaurant, I'm glad we made the trek after a Brooklynite friend's suggestion.

No better way to celebrate my friend Stuart's 30th-some-odd birthday than over a large, communal tray of mixed beasts. ?The pork shoulder was excellent, the duck tasty, but the beef brisket on the fatty side. ?The baked beans were divine! ?The cole slaw, rather than the fetid cabbage mess I've come to fear, was surprisingly delicious, chocked full of sweet crunchy veggies like bell peppers and scented with sesame oil. ?The atmosphere was convivial with everyone packed into rows of picnic benches bantering over beers and the din of fellow eaters. ?

From the second I walked in and inhaled that intoxicating smoke, saw the kick ass decor (including super cool, meat-cleaver tap handles offering up local brews), and checked out the 'cue offerings, I wanted to love Fette Sau. I needed a third 'go to' place for my 'cue in NYC (Dino and Daisy May being the other two). ?Then, I tasted the food. ?FSau's pork ribs, pork sausage, brisket, and beef ribs fell short on flavor; they were sadly bland, hardly had a smoke ring, needed a little sauce to cut through the dryness (and add flavor), and were too overpriced. ?I doubt I'll return. ?Why is it so hard to get 'cue right in the North, let alone the food capital of the US?

Oh man, I must start this by saying I'm originally from Oklahoma. We Oklahomans know a thing or two about BBQ. I'd been so disappointed by all the other BBQ places I had ever tried in New York. So second rate, and ridiculously expensive for what you got. While I'm not saying Fette Sau is cheap, by any means, it is VERY good and the best BBQ I've that wasn't in the South. I recently moved to the Upper West Side from Wiliamsburg, and while I'm loving Central Park as my back yard, I will say I miss having Fette Sau at arms length. Although I guess it is a good break for my waistline. :) Love love love love Fette Sau.

My friends in NYC took me to this place when I visited them, and we bought some of the brisket, pork rib, and shredded pork shoulder. My favorite was the brisket. I thought it was perfectly cooked and delicious w/ bbq sauce they had!! ?My friend liked the ribs, and it was juicy. ?I thought 3 different kinds of sauce was enough options (sweet bbq sauce, vinegar, and spicy sauce). We had potato salad, baked bean, and coleslaw. I'm not a fan of baked bean, but it was soooo goood! all of them were generally pretty tasty. We were there Friday night around 6:30pm and I thought the line was already long enough; however, the line was getting ridiculously longer while we were eating. I would recommend to get there before 6:30pm for dinner if you are planning to get a table and seat. The aroma of pork will get on your outfit for hours, so be prepared.

After a day at the Brooklyn Brewery we stopped at Fette Sau. ?Seeing a line we were encouraged and the wait which was around a half hour was worth it. I tried the Berkshire Pork Chops, the Hot Links, the Pork Belly. the Brisket and two Sides. The pork chops get a ten! Moist, great Flavor, not a lot of Fat, wow! The Hot links were good, Nice Heat but I was looking for a little more Flavor. The pork belly was Fatty Bacon that had wonderful morsels of meat sandwiched between the fat of the bacon. You have to be ready for the Pork belly. Not for everyone but for those who know what it is it is Great! The Brisket was Hands down a Home Run. I wanted more and still do! ?The beans were a Very good Burnt ends version and will order it again. Great flavor and texture. good n thick and almost a meal in itself. The Broccoli salad was a little too raw for me. if they steamed the Broccoli ?a Little to soften it up it would have worked better. Now the menu is Fluid and changes as they run out of things so you have to go a few times to try everything so by all means do so!

BBQ Heaven! The Fat Pig is unique and unlike any other i have had. I am from Texas so i know all about the saucy bbq, the caramalized bbq sauce after hours in the pit, and the basted sauce on the ribs and other chunks of meat. Well if that is what you are looking for, Fette Sau is not the place for you. If you are looking for a more dry, less slobby bbq, this is the ideal place for you. I came here with a large group and 6 of us decided to share a platter with a little of everything, and the food server knew exactly what to prepare. 1. a rack of pork ribs- dry rub, meat fell of the bone, it was amazing. it was perfectly seasoned and the meat was not dry whats so ever. the ribs were actually pretty meaty as well so that was a plus. this was the highlight of my night 2. Beef brisket- it was just ok, i think this was the factor why i didnt give this place 5 stars. the meat was a little dry for my taste, but had a good flavor. 3. Pork Sausage- one of the BEST sausages i have had. it was spicy, tender and sweet at the same time 4. flank steak- it was good, delicious with their sauces 5. Pork Belly- yes, the highly talked about pork belly. 80% fat, 100% melts in your mouth, like you are in heaven taste. it was soo good. after a few pieces, you feel like you should stop but you can't, then you get a little nauscous, but you still cant stop... until its all gone 6. Bake Beans- another reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5. it was kind of cold and i didnt like the flavor. i have had way better beans in the past. 7. potatoe salad/broccoli/kraut- didnt have any, no room for it after all the meat 8. Gallon of beer- we got the coney island beer, it was just perfect with the food. wash it all down and filled the gaps in my stomach. for 6 of us the bill came out to be $130ish with drinks, not bad at all. There is a TV in the fire place that shows fire, if you ask them to change the channel, i.e. to watch the NBA finals, they will change it for you. i didnt think the TV was connected to cable. i would certainly come back to this place again, great find!

BBQ you can live by. ?Finally a BBQ spot in NYC that respects the process. ?Do yourself a favor and have some of the best tasting brisket this side of I-75 (Texans know what I'm talking about). ?The beans were delicious and the fine selection of whiskey and brew made me feel like I didn't have to go home. ?The only complaint is the seating (not enough), but concessions must be made to have a little piece of home in the BK.

For a place that serves organic meat, they're sure not concerned about the environment. I went in for take out and asked for it to go. They separately wrapped each type of meat into large separate pieces of waxed paper and then placed into a waxed bag. The rolls got a separate waxed bag. And the potato salad (I had ordered broccoli salad and didn't realize it was potato until I got it home) got it's own separate bag, too. All 3 of these went into 1 large paper bag. When I asked if I could just leave the paper bag there - the response was "it would really be easier if you took it." I get that. But what ever happened to using less in the first place? It's cheaper for you, too, Fette Sau. Please make your take-out standards as high as your meat standards.

First, let it be known that I came here with a group of 6 and we had no problem sitting together at a table inside. ?And the line to order was not long. ?I'm sure it helped that it was a Wednesday (at around 8pm) and pretty chilly outside. We ordered a 3/4 pound each of the pulled pork and beef brisket, a quarter pound of pork belly and some spicy pork sausage links. ?I think it was a good move to get a little of each to share. ?The pork belly was especially good. ?I thought the pulled pork and beef brisket were just okay -- they were not flavorful enough without a strong helping of the sauce. ?Speaking of the sauce, the mustard is really hot. ?Beware. ?I was also a little disappointed with the sides. ?The baked beans were solid, but the potato salad and cole slaw were just passable. ? I'm still giving this four stars because the food was certainly not bad and the atmosphere is good. ?You should go to Fette Sau if you like barbeque, for sure. ?To be fair, I'm a little under the weather and probably would have enjoyed it more it I had been in better health and spirits. ? I have a good friend from Texas and I'll probably try it again with him the next time he is in town.

I don't know how this place isn't five stars from everyone. I've eaten a fair amount of BBQ in my life. The South. Kansas City. Chicago. Even some decent North Woods ribs, but Fette Sau's taste and atmosphere remain the best. The meat selection is great and weighed by the pound on a butcher's scale - nothing new mind you, but perfect for the atmosphere. A garage-turn-dining area complete with six revolving hours of dvd fire. Maybe isn't not six hours, but I sat through an hour and a half of it. The drinks aren't the cheapest, but the selection is good considering the purpose of the place is meat. A personal favorite: the pork belly on a potato roll. One of my favorite places in Williamsburg, although it's best to find a downtime to avoid the crowd. When exactly that time occurs is unknown to me.

As a barbeque connoisseur, I can't even imagine it getting any better. The meat is so tender it doesn't even need sauce, though the stuff provided at the tables is obviously homemade and delicious. Fette Sau is hands down the best barbeque in the city, but I'm going to go a step further and say it is among the best food I've ever had. Ribs fall right off the bone. When pulled pork isn't done right, it's either tough or too mushy, but the pork here is at a perfect balance. Most places serve brisket quite lean, but the brisket at Fette Sau is juicy as brisket can get. And the pork belly, I don't know how they do it. It is perfectly rubbed and charred on the outside but done just right on the inside. Fette Sau changes their menu every night. Some reviewers may complain about a lack of seating, which can happen, but I think as soon as you try the ribs, pork belly or brisket, you'll let it slide. Prices are pretty reasonable too. All meat is served by the pound and isn't more than $18, (ribs are $15, and brisket is I think $14) so you can get a good half-pound portion of meat (which comes with rolls) and not break the bank. The only improvement I can see being made is a better selection of sides, like a mashed potato or a macaroni and cheese, but until then, I think I'll just eat more meat. See for yourself why I can't say enough good things about this place.

This is the best BBQ I ever have. especially pork rib nothing describe better than I make a trip there 6 times in 2 months. I always take friends there and they all say the same thing. The only comment is they close so early and run out of food so fast.

Realistically not much needs to be said about this place. Any food establishment that sells delicious slow cooked meat by the pound and offers tap beer in one gallon jugs is a-okay in my book. As soon as you walk in you get hit with an overwhelming scent of wood burning and pork. This is also known as THE BEST SCENT IN THE WORLD. Seriously once you walk in you know you're in for a treat. I plan on coming back as often as my body can possibly handle all the fatty delicious brisket.

5 stars for the food/ambience. -1 star for the seating (but in reality -100). Absolute pain in the arse, survival-of-the-fittest style seating arrangement in the form of communal tables, inside and out. If you go on a Saturday night (like I just did), be prepared for not only the long line (which is fine b/c I think the food is worth it) but to scope out a free seat the minute you get there. ...but that's part of the problem, too. Of the people who were seated, only 50% seemed to be eating. 40% were just finishing drinks and socializing and the remaining 10% were holding seats while someone else got food. This is an awful system. I noticed staff were quick to clear away plates and glasses...but not people. There were 25 people in line but no seats. I'd give this place googolplex stars if they would just practice some crowd control.

Get ready to serve yourself in the best possible way. ?So the plan should be to send part of your team out to procure a table while the rest chooses the meat. ?It is always fantastically delicious food served on baking pans with rolls of paper towels nearby. ?If you get a chance to eat at the bar do so, the bartenders are expert bourbon guides and you will learn more about bourbon and whiskey than you thought possible. ?Still not spending a fortune and having a really great time.

this is the best bbq i have ever had. who would have thought that this place beats any southern roadside bbq pit to the death! The best part is the simplicity of Fette Sau: you walk in, get on line, buy as many pounds of pulled pork, pork belly, brisket, sausages, etc to your liking, get baked beans and/or their german potato salad, which is bangin, pay, buy a pitcher of one of their rather flawless selections of beer and a a shot of whiskey, sit at a bench inside or out, and eat. no snotty-nosed hipster servers with their panties in a twist...none of it! Its great, it's well worth the money, and it's pretty reasonable for what you're getting, which is THE BEST BBQ IN NEW YORK BY FAR!

Some friends and I decided to take advantage of a recent Indian summer Saturday to do some outside eating and drinking. ?We ended up at Fette Sau and luckily snagged one of the outside picnic tables. We ordered 1/2 pound of just about all of the meat on the menu. ?Pulled pork, ribs (dry rub), spicy sausage, brisket and pork jowl. ?The pulled pork was dry and just didn't pack a smoky barbecue flavor. ?I was pretty disappointed with that. ?I can't complain about the ribs, but they weren't special. ?They were nice and juicy, but the taste wasn't anything to write home about. ?The sausage was pretty good; nice and meaty with a good kick. ?The brisket was very good, with a great balance of meat and fat and an amazing crust. ?The pork jowl was pretty damn incredible. ?The barbecue flavor was intense and it was very rich and fatty, reminding me of bone marrow. As for sides we got the baked beans with burnt ends and German potato salad. ?The baked beans were a little bit of a let down because I just didn't really taste the burnt ends goodness. ?It was pretty much just baked beans. ?It was a little bland, especially for what we paid (large is $9, I believe). ?The German potato salad was also a let down. ?I love my potato salad with a good helping of vinegar, mustard and some bacon, and while you could definitely see the mustard seeds in the potato salad, it didn't have the kick of the vinegar or much of a mustard taste and no bacon whatsoever. ?That coupled with the large chunks of potatoes left the potato salad tasting a bit too much like plain potatoes. The beer selection was very spot-on and the whiskey selection is beyond reproach. ?I love how they serve beer by the gallon and the price is pretty decent (it comes out to about $4.50 per pint). I probably won't travel back here for their barbecue, but if you haven't been here I definitely recommend giving them a try.

I love the food here. ?I like that it doesn't follow all the rules of barbecue. ?I get sick of overhearing people in line bitch about how they don't have mac n cheese (I think they do now) or how the potato salad isn't drowned in mayonaise. ? It's a German name, folks, maybe that should tip you off that it's a little different than your standard barbecue. ?I don't care if you're from South Carolina, or Memphis, or Texas, or wherever the "best" barbecue is from. ?This is its own thing, and it's great. The pulled pork is the best value. ?It costs less per pound, and there are no bones adding to the weight. ?It's amazing. ?I once yearned for different sauces, but now I love the ones they have, combined or on their own. ?You get nice potato rolls and can make mini sandwiches with different combinations. ?The ribs, while a little pricier, are also delicious. ?I'm kind of like a kid in a candy store at FS. ?I'm so tempted by all the options. ?I often go for some pulled pork, a few pieces of brisket, a sausage, some potato salad, and pickles. ?If I'm extra hungry, or it's more than just me and my girlfriend eating, I'll go for the baked beans, which are delicious and have bonus meat in them. ?Sometimes I'll get a few pieces of pork belly. ?So rich! ?They've also got that new fangled home-fermented saurkraut. ?Tasty. ?And healthy, I hear. No problems with the food, really. ?I think they need a different system for ordering. ?They have huge communal tables made of wood so thick that some of the table legs take up seating. ?You'll see what I mean. ?Also, it's really tricky to negotiate waiting in line, ordering food, and then finding somewhere to sit. ?What if, after waiting in line for 30 minutes (which is common) you can't get a seat? ?Well, I usually let my girlfriend sit and hold the seats while I wait in line, but people can get pissed off at this, especially if they just got their food. ?The system is store-like in that you order by the pound at ?a counter. ?Sort of like going to a butcher. ?I think that's the concept they're going for. ?Fine. ?But there's only one guy cutting and weighing the meat. ?If you're into american whisky, they have a huge selection, including some very obscure ones. ?They also have a great selection of micro brews, but honestly, I'd like a lighter beer to go with my heavy meats. ?A PBR, Highlife, or Bud would go great with this food. ?Sixpoint's Righteous Rye, while stellar, is just too thick in this context.

Worth a trip but needs some work The space is great, the food is really good and the bourbon and beer selection phenomenal, but we had some issues. First, the line was extremely long. We expected that but once we reached the front, we realized what the problem was. They only have one scale to weigh out customer orders. If they just added one more station, wait time could be cut in half. I guess that may create a seating issue though. Still, it seemed very inefficient. Second, the bartender, although really knowledgable and outwardly customer-service oriented enough, was so negatively passive aggressive towards the patrons, I was amazed. He stated outright to one that next time, they should leave a tip which would be good for everyone, told someone else he didn't have time to recommend a cocktail, refused to pour beer from a very large jug into a glass for another because "if he did it for one customer, he'd have to do it for everyone." He also refused to continue serving another customer, who was foreign, because he hadn't left a tip. I understand that tipping is the right thing to do and that it must be frustrating for bartenders when people don't tip, but honestly, maybe if he had been a little nicer, it wouldn'thave been an issue.

means 'fat pig' in German. also seriously cool bbq joint. here's how it works: you line up, pick your meats on display(had ribs, brisket, tips, pork belly-sold by pound so mix & match), pick your sides(guss' sauerkraut, cora's broccoli salad, pickles, tater rolls), grab drinks(sarsaparilla, kelso hop lager) and sit at a communal table with like-minded gluttons. enjoyable enough to sorta forgive that meat isn't off-the-grill hot like i'd like or the ribs tad dry. and don't wear the good duds as you'll smell like dinner-smoky.

I don't care how good your BBQ is. And yes, it is the best I have maybe ever had. I have had lots. (born in Memphis, raised in Martin, Knoxville , Nashville & Atlanta.) But somewhere between the dour henchman that serves the meat with an icy glare and the smirking Gothika on the register; it's all just so freaking pretentious, smug , and self-satisfied. You have to crane your neck 180 degrees to see the chalkboard menu. Darth Cleaver stares at you with his arms crossed waiting, his eyes nearly rolling over in his head, if you don't present your order within 10 seconds. ( BY WEIGHT or your head will be removed) If you use metric you probably get some sort of reprieve from his hatred of you. It's good to come with a personal waiter to fetch your drinks for you from the other bar and register. ooh , how orderly. Don't bother with any sides other than the baked beans. potato salad , horrible. broccoli salad , worse. I wish a shoeless , homeless, smelly hippie was outside fette sau selling south Carolina cole slaw by the lukewarm pint. It's not clever, it is retarded. Honestly, you look like jerks. I get the feeling that the owner must be really really really in love with his great idea for this place, but is way too proud to admit some changes need to be made. Even if it is the best BBQ NYC has ever seen (which isn't hard , if you are just doing it right) , this joint should lighten the fuck up. Your specialness is really cute. Now cut it out.

The food was 5 stars, the service was decent but nothing spectacular. The worst thing about this place is the line to get food, which was long and winding when we arrived, although over the course of an hour and a half there it occasionally shrunk to a reasonable slze. The only other negative is they're a little pricey for eating in a garage, with a long line, community picnic tables, and eating off of deli paper. That said, the brisket was delicious but so there's so much fat to cut off just to be able to eat it that I don't think I'd order it again. The ribs were tender and delicious but both the people with me said my rub was better and that mine are juicier and of course I have to agree, there's a reason I'm known as a rib master around my hood. The pulled pork was excellent, no criticism, as was the pork shoulder. They were out of the baked beans by the time we got thru the line but the ones I saw going by while in line looked and smelled great. The pickles were good, the german potato salad was the first I've liked. Oh and note they have a selection of local beers on tap and an impressively large collection of whiskeys at the bar which will help with that wait so go with a friend or more to divide and conquer because it's a separate line.

A real BBQ place in Brooklyn. It's an exciting concept and luckily Fette Sau delivers. Fette works with the authentic style of having a number of BBQ options sold per pound and served with bread (potato rolls in this case) on paper. The ultra small cafeteria styled seating continues (without doors or walls) outside to a large open area but fills up quick. Due to the fact that you first get your food then find your seat it's quite possible you're going to be waiting around with your food looking for a table so bring someone to hold a table before hand or have patience during busy times (or get your food to go). Prices aren't dirt cheap but they aren't unreasonable either (expect to pay about $20 on food per person). In addition Fette has a full bar with some good micro brews on tap. Everything had a great smoky flavor and although nothing I had was particularly juicy nothing was tough either. They're so confident on their meats here that they don't rely on BBQ sauce (everything comes sans sauce but two types are available at the tables). I particularly liked the pulled pork and the BBQ beef pastrami. I got the last measly part of a rack of ribs and they were decent (tender and well seasoned and cooked right) but the guy sitting next to be got a new batch that looked a lot better so I'll have to try them again and hopefully get ones that have more meat and are even more tender. Fette Sau is definitely a hipster spot and it's not the perfect BBQ but it's certainly pretty good and better than most of their competition in the city.

I was so excited to come here! I LOVE BBQ! We walked in and the place was just starting to get packed. The guy at the counter was super friendly and suggested that we order about 1lb for 2 people and 2 sides, I thought this was way too much for us and I was right. I let my bf do the ordering at the meat counter and I took a seat at the large picnic table. He came back with beef ribs, tongue (never ever thought i would try this!), brisket, and pulled pork with a ?side of cole slaw and pickles. Looked delicious, took one bite it was cold. I found that odd since we walked in when the place opened. What a disappointment! It could have been decent BBQ if even served warm. ?As far as taste, it was okay, not the greatest but hey what can I expect I was in Williamsburg not down south. The place is cute but I honestly don't think I would go back, didn't think it was worth it. I am sure there has got to be amazing and delicious BBQ somewhere around here, well i'm hoping!

Ate here earlier today, and while I was leaning toward 2 star, I just couldn't shake the 1 star feeling I've had all day. ?But I'll go positive, negative, positive. ? Positive: ?Cool decor, laid back vibe. Negative: ?I walk in, grab a paper menu on their counter. ?Unsure of how the ordering process works, but nonetheless I order from a nice counter-guy. ?I ask if I pay him, but he says not 'til he's done getting my order ready. ?Unsure again of what that means, I go to sit down. ? Within 2 minutes, the female cashier comes over and says a bit coarsely, "you're food's ready - next time, you can just wait up there because we tend to get busy" (or something like that). ?I ignore it, looking forward to grabbing my $15 lunch. ?Except that she rings me up for over $24. ?I suggest this is the wrong price, but she firmly rebuffs that and charges me $24. ? I go to sit down, do the mental gymnastics again, and come up with much less then $24. ?I go to the counter guy, and ask for an explanation. ?He tells me I need to have the cashier explain it to me. ?I go to the cashier. ?She suggests that she only rang me up for what was on the ticket and shows little interest in helping satisfy my curiosity to find out what I've been charged. ?I firmly suggest that I've been overcharged and I need to her to walk me through the ticket. ?As it turns out, after ALOT of back and forth, they explain to me that the paper menu I ordered from is actually not the menu they're using today, and it's only good for ordering out. ?They have a different, and more expensive menu for ordering in (even if you order the SAME EXACT meal). ?In addition, after some auditing we still discover they've overcharged my credit card $5.40 (after I politely asked her to do the math out-loud with me). ?She says, "I can give you that back IF YOU WANT." ?(My mental answer is obviously, yes, I want the money back that I've been overcharged. ?My actual answer is still... yes). No option to have it put back on my card, just a handing over of the $5. ? ? Positive: The counter guy, sensing that maybe perhaps the axiom that the customer is always right (or, at the very least, an attempt should be made to smooth things over, especially when the business is in the wrong) hands me a free sausage to go with my lunch. ?That is the correct way to do business, unlike the rest of my encounter at this spot. ? So, I guess what I'm saying is, I get that Fette Sau is trying to fall in line with all the other faux, cute, artsy, neobohemian, trendy, rustic, quasi-artisanal, overpriced, blah blah places in Brooklyn, but your service really sucked. ?And your food is just okay. ?The fact that this happened about 12 hours ago shows that I'm a little hardheaded to not forgive and forget, but that you also left a really bad taste in my mouth (and it wasn't just the coleslaw). ? Other then that awful customer service experience (and don't be mistaken - it wasn't the 'we're slammed/I'm having a bad day' type of bad customer service.. nor was it the soup nazi our shit is so good we can be marginally abusive customer service.. it was lazy, I don't want to explain to you why I just over charged you and don't want to take the time to make this right kind of customer service), the food was good and the decor is right on. ?I will bet that the 600+ Yelp reviews aren't misguided by saying this food is very good. ?But, I will not go back again. ?Way, way, way too fucking rude for me to waste my money on supporting this type of service. ?I want to end by saying that I felt like I had to fight to be treated like a customer. ?Never again at this place.

It was great once upon a time. Then the prices started to rise. The beer menu was surpassed by others and we realized how much a drink was going for. Fighting over table space is never a joy either. The BBQ is still good, but I guess it's not worth either the hassle or the price anymore, esp in the summer months when we can do it ourselves at how. Pork belly is still a joy though!

its like eating in a garage! the meats are tender but very fatty. this is one of those eat once a month type of place or you are risking a heart attack kind of joints. good food but not healthy for those who are health nuts.

After 15 years of being a vegetarian, I stopped when my friend took me here. ?There are NO vegetarian options, except maybe for a side of broccoli. Not even options for pseudo-vegetarian poultry eaters. ?But this place is amazing. ?The pork belly has got to be one of the best things I've ever tasted in my life, and I've eaten at some of the best restaurants. ?Slow roasted to perfection, and melts in your mouth goodness. ? The whiskey selection only adds to the great experience that is Fette Sau.

the bbq craze might not seem like much of a big thing these days, but fette sau still serves up some very taste bbq. ?i'm not a big ribs person (too messy with meat bits always stuck in your teeth), but i love their pulled pork and brisket. ?i have, however, witnessed at least two rib-offs (fastest & cleanest to the bone wins) among my friends, and they seemed to like the food well enough, judging by the meatless bone discards laid out before them (or maybe they're just really competitive?).

Brisket, pork shoulder, pork belly, pork sausage. Meat overload that will not disappoint. ?We went early (7pm) for a Saturday and it was packed. ?Only complaint is that we called earlier to ask about air conditioning and they said they had it - but didn't mention the open garage door letting all of the air out. ?Tough to tolerate in 95 degree heat!

so. damn. good. the beef selections (beef brisket and boneless beef ribs) were my fave. i didnt love the pork belly or pulled pork as much but pretty good nonetheless. love the communal tables and cozy atmosphere. also the baked beans were amazing. the only thing that was annoying was that bagged potato chips (for the kid) were $2.75... really!?

fette sau is awesome. there is no doubt about that. if you like meat, you will enjoy it and you will have fun. there are only 2 problems- not enough seating and less than stellar service. the meat man seems to hate us for being there, but whatever, he can't bring me down. sitting at the bar is a fun option and the beer selection is really good.

I saw this place on a TV show about 3 weeks ago and I told myself I got to try this place. ?Finally I went there last night with 4 of my coworkers (which was smoked whole pig Thursday night); it was just OK. ?As all the other yelpers say, the pork belly was great but the pork shoulder, T-bone, and chop was kind of dry. ?With a little sauce on it, the meat was better but not great. ?The smoked prime rib was tasty and so was the brisket. ?Also order the chicharrn at $35 a lb which was OK but my local cuchifritos shop taste better at a way better price. ?The baked beans and the cole slaw were just OK but could have done with them. ?We also ordered a gallon of the Kelso tap beer which was bitter. ?The tray of meat plus sides for 5 people came out $172 and the gallon of beer was additional $36. ?I think the cost is above average. ?All in all a good time if you have the right company. ?I will go again but I won't go out of my way to get there. ?The never ending search for the best BBQ continues....

i will say this...the meats were great. my husband and i split pork loin, pastrami, and pork belly. it was all excellent. very tender and delicious. i was kind of bummed out they didn't have any spare ribs when i went. really, no ribs??!! so, now for the sides...didn't like em. people were raving about the beans on here, and i don't get it. i guess i just like tangy beans, and they weren't. they tasted like they use some kind of bourbon in them, and i don't drink, so maybe that's what turned me off? also, their german potato salad and sauerkraut was not good. this place can get a little pricey, and waiting for a seat can be annoying. but, the meats are worth going for. so there!

Wow...just wow. The pork belly and ribs we had were juicy, tasty, and excellent. The ordering process could've been quicker, and the fact that they sell out of ribs very early on is a disappointment...but what they had less more than made up for it. Do yourself a favor and go with a group, then order a whole bunch of table items for everyone to share. The BBQ is delicious, and as for it being cold, I didn't have any problem.

The absolute best BBQ I've had thus far in New York. This place is really hip and they have a fantastic selection of beers on tap. I really enjoyed the Brisket and Pulled Pork. While the ribs were great I feel that they were overpriced for what they were. I've been here twice so far and I will keep brining my friends. I can't wait to go in the summer when they open up the patio so I can enjoy my BBQ outside of the smokey interior.

Fantastic!!! We decided to go early since we were hungry, but that also meant that there was no line and easy seating. Had the bone-in pork belly, pulled pork, broccoli, slaw, a couple rolls, cider from the bar. We loved pretty much everything except the extreme fattiness of the belly. Yea, pork belly has a lot of fat, but that that price it shouldn't be practically ALL fat...just sayin is all :) Next time I go I want to try the flight of rye whiskey from the bar.

As you have read in the other reviews, this used to be a garage and they didn't do much to the interior when they moved in except add a bar, heat lamps and picnic tables. The meat is outstanding. Particular favorites are the brisket, pork belly and sausage. ?I have had their ribs when they were dry, boneless ribs however were to die for. When my boyfriend and I go we choose two meats eat, get the smallest portion (1/2 lb) and2 sides, one of which is always the bakes beans that have a bit of a kick to them. ?Don't waste your time on green vegetables to make yourself feel better, the greenbeans i tried were downright no good. ?Then we split everything on our tray, and it's a wonderful feast. ?Be sure to stop at the bar (very cool) to grab a Blue Point Toasted Lager, no beer goes better with their BBQ in my opinion. or a flight of whiskeys, bourbons, or rye (or a mix) which helps burn the meat in you belly. Hints: don't eat too fast, it's tempting bc it's so good, but you will be in pain if you do this. Don't starve yourself before hand, the shock to your stomach is not good and you will be in pain if you do this. DO cross the street and go to their bar Spuyten Duyvil with an amazing assortment of beers on tap.

Definitely deserves a five star rating. Sampled the pork belly, pork chop, beef brisket, collard greens, and beans, and a variety of bourbons. Just order by the pound and you get a beautiful lunch tray of goodness. The beans were smoky and had pulled pork in it. The brisket was tender and succulent. For sauces I recommend the spicy. Variety of bourbons was great too, cut through the fattiness of the barbecue.

pronounced "fet-tuh za-o" (rather german - means "fat pig"), but according to my german friends, apparently not entirely german. but who the hell cares cuz it's my favourite place in all of nyc... i discovered this place last year, and i think that had a part in my subconscious decision to move to the area. basically, if you're a real fan of meat (therefore love some fatty goods), there's something you can fall in love with here. for me, it's always been the pork belly. but pretty much anything that's regular on the menu - pulled pork, pork shoulder, beef brisket, ribs - will be absolutely solid. the sausage/bratwurst, i've had better tho (at radegast a short walk from there!). i discovered that they have whole pigs on thursdays. i had the chance to go in right as they opened on a thursday and get myself a lil taster plate of various pigs head parts (jowl, snout, ear, tongue, jaw, cheek, and EYEBALL!). it was an experience, and i am a fan of the jowl and tongue, but u can't go wrong with some regular ol' belly. sides are unique, delicious, and german in style - mustard-based potato salad, rather vinegary broccoli salad & coleslaw with apples and peppers, and oh the baked beans!!! (they throw all kinds of meat scraps in there, and it is amaaaazing). basically, i have to try and not go here more than once a week.

I went to Fette Sau on Friday with a couple of friends. This place was so cool - it's a converted auto shop garage and definitely had that industrial feel to it. The taps were adorned with butcher's knives! We ordered the brisket, pork shoulder and sausage, as well as the Brooklyn IPA. The meat was so good and the smoky mustard sauce was a great topper! The place was definitely crowded since it was around 10 p.m., so we had to wait a couple of minutes to get a seat at one of the indoor picnic tables, but the people were so friendly that they scooted right over to make room for us. The music was great - classic rock - apparently the music is bartender's choice. All around an awesome place to hit up if you are in Williamsburg - and if you aren't, make the trip!

I am an avid southern food fanatic. I have been all around Brooklyn, Manhattan, Harlem. I have eaten at Fette Sau a handful of times. And I cannot figure out why everyone speaks so highly of this place? I have been back only to see if it has gotten any better. I agree, the brisket is great. And a lovely beer menu as well. But holy shit! The ribs were almost unedible! My father came to visit about a month ago and I wanted to take him somewhere in the neighborhood that I thought he may like. He tends to be a tad picky but likes southern a great deal. We showed up on a Sunday at around 2 or so. We got the counter and ordered a bunch of pork ribs, beef ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. As well as the 2 or 3 sides that they have (thats it?). Then we got some cold beers and sat outside. The employees were super nice and friendly. We started eating and the pok ribs were aweful. They were so tough and smokey. whatever. We moved onto the beef ribs. Same sort of thing. So we are thinking. Maybe just needs sauce. Ahaha!! Nope! The sauce was literally the worst bbq sauce ive ever had! I cannot figure out why its so highly rated on Yelp? Its lacking some major ingredient and I cannot figure out what. I actually at one point went to the nice lady who was working the counter and asked "is there any other sauce?" She said others have said the same thing. Anyway. I dont ?hate Fette sau, I just think it is highly over-rated. Most of my friends consider it the best ticket in town........?????? Oh well. We left with a huge amount of food left on the tray. I didnt even want to take it home. Again. Very friendly service, good bar, nice looking decor. Collards were good, pulled pork was ok, brisket was decent. But very disapointing in all other areas. Id pick Dinosaur any day of the year.

Lines weren't too bad for a Saturday night, waited only about 15 minutes for our food however finding a seat for 3 people was another story. There are all communal tables which are a nice concept but when your restaurant serves food, is packed with people and patrons sit to only drink and talk -once finished eating- it can cause those who want to eat their meal sitting down like a normal human, lots of unnecessary stress. Food was average at best, nothing special. We had the brisket, pulled pork, berkshire spicy sausage and pork belly which as stated, were average at best. However the beef sirloin was tough, raw and inedible, and the baked beans were sub par and bitter for reasons unknown. Prices were pretty expensive since its sold by the pound and you never really know how much to order per person. Cool means of serving beer and eclectic staff but not worth the hype...Glad I tried it now don't have to wonder if I'm missing out on anything and can cross it off of my food excursion list!
