Whoaaa. ?SOFREAKING FULL. ?Of tasty Taiwanese and Mandarin home style cooking. Queen House is royally satisfying. ?Sizeable portions that make a non-sizeable dent in your wallet. ?A person with an Alexander Hamilton and moderate appetite could pig out. Good sign: ?crowded at early dinner hour. ?Quick table turnover. ?Got seated within ten minutes. ?Another good sign: ?customers speaking Mandarin with the wait staff. Aaaaahhh Y-U-M!! ?My fav Taiwanese delicacies: ?Tsuey ghiao-- or in Mandarin, Shuei jiao. ?(Excuse the rudimentary romanisation; been a while since high school.) ?Queen House's dumplings are at least as good as the ones my dear grandma used to make. Pork and cabbage dumplings... even more delicious than pot stickers. ?Not all greasy oily on the outside, because they're boiled not pan-fried. ?All the easier to stuff more down your gullet. ?Don't you love people like me who enjoy pointing out the extremely obvious?! Eggplant-- garlicky good and as chili hot or not as you want. ?Beef with black mushrooms was very nice, except for a few woody bamboo slices. ?Can't go wrong with the Tofu and mixed veg. Pork intestine has always been a sort of delicacy in Taiwanese/Chinese cooking. ?No idea why. ?A'ma would, on a rare occasion, make dii-doh, so I'm no stranger to pig stomach in my intestine. ?Definitely an acquired taste. ?One friend who truly enjoys it ordered rice vermicelli soup. ?Garlic-y onion-y and the intestine pieces were very tender... a little goes a long way though. ?I'll stick with non-organs for my protein next time, thanks. Large bowl of Beef Stew and Tendon Noodle Soup was dark and soy saucy but didn't taste too salty. ?Plentiful chunks of meat and tendon, but several beef pieces were bland and rather spongey. ?Chew and chew and the thing just won't break down. ?Cheap-o beef, oh well. Then again, what do you expect? ?Best butcher cuts are expensive, not generally found at most Chinese restaurants. ?Go to Mr. Chow's (and wave at the paps) or Tommy Toy's for that. ?Queen House noodle soup choices are vast, but I really like Beef Tendon. ?Rump roast-y beef gets a pass because everything else at Queen House is great. Tendon pieces are excellent. ?Yeahh, get that beef cartilage in, build up your own joint cushioning. ?The chewy part I did not mind were the noodles-- mmm thick and hearty, almost udon texture but just a teensy bit less springy. ?Slurpingly yum. ?Oh yes, you are going to splatter soup all over someone's clothes-- just accept it. Tables are quite close together, no choice but to involuntarily eavesdrop the conversations on either side of you. ?Seriously, there is nowhere to turn to avoid hearing them. ?So yeah, don't say anything too embarrassing. ?Or do it, and see how people react. Exited in food coma. ?Fatt 'n full 'n happy. ?Waddling down the street sipping on milk tea-- mmm Roasted Barley-- which the wait staff bring over from Tea Era next door. This Taiwanese comfort food spot has been in the neighborhood a long time. ?Now you know why. ?Get thee to the Queen's House for a feast on a pauper's budget.

I heard really good things about their beef noodle soup from my friends, so I thought I'd try it. I could tell the staff was used to regulars, and seemed very friendly with some families. It's a small place, seats maybe around 40 people, give or take. My friend ordered a szechuan beef noodle soup while I had the regular beef noodle soup. We shared a northern scallion pancake and xiao long bao (soup dumplings). The food was really mediocre. I thought the beef noodle soup broth was average and slightly sweeter than I'm used to. The beef was good, however the noodles were extremely dense--didn't eat most of it. The northern scallion pancake is really two meals in itself. While the outside was extremely crispy and delicious the middle was too chewy and doughy. The soup dumplings were sad and not soupy at all. The food was ok. The service is good. It was an ok experience. It's one of those places that I'd only go to once.

Met up with Yelp Foodie Friend Ellen at 11:30AM yesterday (hoping to avoid the Friday lunch madness crowd in downtown Mt. View); at least when we arrived there were a FEW empty tables! The restaurant is small and narrow with very little room between the tables (forget having any kind of personal conversation unless you want people on either side of you to know your bizness!). ? A woman plunked down our menus and then brought us water & stood there with pad in hand ready to take our order - hello? ?Between the lunch special menu and the regular menu, there's like...200 items - can we have more than 2 minutes to look at them? ? As I was sitting with my back to the wall, I was able to see her pace back and forth behind Ellen's back and staring at me - not cool. I noticed a giant bowl of steaming hot soup with big fat noodles on every table, BUT, it was really warm on Friday and I didn't want something so hot (not to mention the fact that a line was forming and I started to feel sort of claustrophobic, like I wanted to get OUT of there; so I ordered Pot Stickers and Stir Fry Noodles. ? ?And of course, my appetizer came at the same time as my entree. ?The pot stickers were fine, the noodles - not so much. ?Even as she put them on the table I knew it was lacking -- totally pale (some carrots / veg would have been welcome), no sauce of any kind & when I tasted it, it was totally BLAND. ? You got the chew from the noodle (which was cooked perfectly), but not much else - I kept putting soy sauce on, but seriously, I could have made this dish better myself. Time to go -- except we had to ask for take out boxes THREE times. I might go back for either a late lunch after the lunch crowd has subsided, or dinner, and especially if it was a cold day - the noodle soup and the broth looked rich and satisfying.

So I wouldn't call this place realllyyy "authentic" as it's a gazillion times greasier than any beef noodle soup I've actually had in Taiwan, but this is THE spot for a huge heavy hot bowl of monstrous meaty goodness. It's comfort food on crack. The broth is nearly viscous and its ability to smother and drown all your day's sorrows and worries in its greasy embrace is second to none. The noodles are firm and chewy and beckon you to slurp and slurp and slurp despite the scalding temperature. They give you a lot of beef and tendon here, and while it's not the most high quality meat, its rich and fatty and flavorful and you know what, here I'll take the quantity over the quality. Cozy, busy, cramped, and fast! You can even order bubble tea from Tea Era next door (highly recommended if you haven't already dropped into foodcoma). So yeah, it's all your delicious Taiwanese favorites...on steroids. But I guess this far across the ocean, the extra boost is always welcome.

Such high hopes... For years I waited. I would pass by and it would be so packed with diners that I'd say to myself, "next time." Or I wasn't hungry at the time, and I'd say "next time." Finally, one afternoon I was hungry and there were seats to be had. "Now is the time." Funny enough, I was under the assumption that this was a Taiwanese restaurant. In fact, it is a mish mash of Chinese and Taiwanese and possibly a few other cuisines. We were in search of Taiwanese food, and after perusing the menu decided on the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup. It seemed a popular dish as well, since we heard a few other customers raving about it and others also ordering it. We also ordered a roll with beef and scallions. The beef roll was actually pretty good, but sadly that was the highlight of the meal. The Spicy Beef Noodle Soup was not good...not good at all. For starters, it's more noodle than beef. The noodles are thick; not horrible, but really heavy. And let's talk about the meat...the worst and poorest quality beef I've ever had in a Beef Noodle Soup. The tendon part was more fat than anything. And the beef was pretty much non-existent, with only a few small pieces attached to the fatty tendony stuff. And can you really call something spicy if all you do is throw a few dried peppers on top? The broth was also incredibly oily and didn't have a hearty beefy flavor. I had such high hopes for Queens House. I'd heard such good things about it. And the constant stream of patrons surely accounts for something. Sadly, it did not impress. "Never again."

This is our family's favorite Taiwanese restaurant in Mountain View. The highlight here is the food, not the service nor the ambiance. It's not fancy. But boy, the food here is comfort food at its best. The noodle dishes are what they're famous for. My favorite is the Zha Ziang Mien (Black Bean Noodle). The noodles are perfectly chewy and satisfying, and the sauce has lots of meat, tofu, and cucumber slices to create a balanced flavor. We also often get the 3-dish special. Select three dishes from the designated list for only $22.99, and get free rice or scallion cake. Their stir-fried vegetables, particularly the Taiwanese A-choy, are ?Even the kids ask for this vegetable dish whenever we come. We will definitely be back.

The best mess you can get into! The restaurant is on the smaller side, so there's always a wait during peak hours. Just stop by the tea shop next door to kill some time while you're waiting for your table. Definitely get their crispy onion pancake! There are two kinds, but ask for the messier one. They'll know what you're talking about. It comes out looking like a big pile of pancake mess. It looks like it's made up of all the reject pancakes put together, but it definitely is NOT a loser! Just enough oil and saltiness with a mixture of crispy and chewy textures. So good... Also, you can't miss the spicy beef tendon noodle soup made with FRESH noodles! Thick, chewy noodles in a big bowl of spicy beefy goodness. The beef and tendon are super tender and the broth has just enough spice to it. If I wasn't so full from the pancake, I would have drank that broth. There were a lot of tables eating some family dishes. I'll have to try that next time.

Overall, I like this place just fine, I'm mostly writing this review to let folks know about the beef noodle soup. After reading all the rave reviews we went for it, both me and my sister ordered the schezuan beef tendon noodle soup and someone else ordered the beef noodle soup. They included a good amount of meat, I liked the noodles...BUT the soup was oddly sweet. We compared notes afterwards and none of us liked the soup base. My noodle soup was not very spicy either. So it was quite a disappointment, all three of us won't be ordering that again and much prefer QQ noodles beef noodle soup. The other table had a buncha people order the stewed meat over rice, that looked tasty, so maybe next time I'll just order something else. ?Anyways, if you like a sweeter beef noodle soup, then this is the place for you.

The Queen House has been around for a really long time. Consistently good food - lunch time is very crowded - you need to get there early or the place fills up quickly. The Lunch Special is the best deal in town. They even have their Signature Eggplant with spicy garlic sauce among their Lunch Special. You've gotta try it - melt in your mouth good!

I was told by a friend that the eggplant in spicy garlic sauce was amazing and a must try. ?We went there recently and ordered from the 3 dishes for $25 menu. ?Along with the eggplant--which was as good as advertised, but not *that* spicy--we also got the salt and pepper spareribs and broccoli beef. ?The spareribs were excellent, but the broccoli beef tasted a little off. ?Maybe the meat was starting to turn bad? ?Not sure, but it was the least impressive dish. ? This is definitely a great place to go for some affordable and tasty Chinese food. ?Apparently, they also specialize is some more traditional Taiwanese dishes, which I will have to try. ?Also, the beef noodle soup is supposed to be really good. ?I'll wait for a cold, rainy evening to give that a go.

Usually there are some dish that I like in a restaurant which get me to go back again and again. ?For this place, it's the spicy seafood noodle soup. I have been looking for that kind of noodle soup up in bay area for a long time, but just have found a place that's close to in flavor in what I know it needs to be. ?This is the only place in Bay Area that I found to have the broth that's closest to the best one I've had long time ago somewhere else. ?The portion is so huge that i know I shoudn't eat it all, but sometimes I just can't stop. :-) Other than spicy seafood noodle soup, I have tried their Taiwanese style dish like oyster cake..etc. ?Unfortunately, I don't feel they are as good and as authentic. ?So I think I'll stick with their noodle dish and maybe their other more traditional dishes.

Amazing food! I love everything I've tried on their menu. I think the eggplant in spicy garlic sauce is the main of many favorites. Mmmm... I wish I could have some right now. The customer service is really good. The people are really sincere. I recently went there with a friend who ordered a bowl of soup, took one sip and said she didn't want it and asked them to take it off the table. There was nothing wrong with the soup, she just didn't want soup all of a sudden. I insisted on paying for the soup but the lady working there didn't let us. I was amazed. The missing star is only because of the ambiance. It's very bland and cold...it had no style really. I wish it was more warm and welcoming so that you could enjoy staying there while eating the yummy food.

We came here on a biz trip, and decided to stop by this place and have some spicy beef noodle. ?I wouldn't say this place is intimate, but more intimidate! I remember someone mentioned about some mean waiter here. ?I wasn't sure which one but they all looked kinda mean; perhaps that's the normal Chinese "expressionless face". ?Hell, I kinda have a CEF, Chinese Expressionless Face, too. The noodle bowl came, and I thought it was large enough to feed 1.5 persons! ?2 skinny Chinese girls can actually share one bowl together, except 2 skinny Chinese girls with stomach of an abyss! ?I'd tell ya, I did NOT finish all my noodle... It was way too much. Taste wise, the soup was on the salty side, and the noodle did not inherit the salt from the soup. ?What gives? ? While I was sipping my salty soup, the cooks were screaming and yelling by the kitchen entrance. ?I couldn't distinguish what they were saying in Fukien language, but they were just too F$#*%&@)(#* LOUD! ?What gives?!?!?! ?STFU already! ?I am trying to drink your salty soup! After my salty soup, the 2nd shift waiter came with a stiff face. ?I guess the stiff face just made my soup even saltier...

Queen's house is the place to be if your secret desire is to sit REALLY REALLY closely with two other people (like if you were part of the same party) and pretend like the other two people don't exist in this world. That's how compact the seating is here. Call in the fire marshals! I got the Szechuan Cold Noodles, I think my GF got the House Special Noodles. Warning Szechuan Cold Noodles doesn't come with any meet. And the Spiciness is not really spicy at all. This is Taiwanese old place, I don't think they know how to make Szechuan stuff. The House Special Noodles were pretty good though, good chucks of meat and nice tasting broth. Bottom-line: Portions are humongous for a relatively cheap price. But you'll have to get nice and cozy with complete strangers.

I ordered the salt and pepper shrimp and beef tendon soup. The shrimp was lightly battered and served with raw onions and shallots - one of my favorite simple Chinese dishes. I really enjoyed the beef tendon soup, though. The tendon cuts could have been a little bit smaller, but the broth was dark, flavorful and the noodles eggy and rich. Loved it. The atmosphere was casual, intimate. I like that it's just a hole-in-the-wall kinda place. Somewhere to grab a quick bite before heading out to window shop in downtown. Can't wait to go back to try more of their soups.

A solid three and a half stars for Queen's House. Though service was fast, I couldn't bump it up because they didn't give me Chinese sauerkraut (suan cai, sour vegetable) with my beef noodle soup. At least for free, anyway. This review is solely for their beef noodle soup, which, let's just face it, should be the only reason you go with so many Caucasians sitting in the restaurant. What I mean is, if that's what their known for, that's what you should try, right? I've had my share of beef noodle soups around the world, and having tried it in Taiwan, where it's famous for the dish, I can confidently say that my favorite is in Taipei. However, I can understand why people like the beef noodle soup from Queen's House. The noodles are excellent, very fresh and chewy. It really has substance when you bite into it, unlike those dry noodles you buy from the supermarket. The broth is also pretty legit. It has the right flavors from the beef, but the only difference is it's also a tad sweeter than the broths in Taiwan. This sweetness is very addicting, and it's proven by all the rave for this dish here. However, it also feels like the added sweetness is supposed to make up for the flavors that are lacking in a true authentic beef noodle broth. One other issue I have to bring up is that even if you don't like Chinese sauerkraut, it's part of the beef noodle soup, and if you're going to serve it, you better offer it with the dish. We weren't asked for it as an option, and when we did ask them for it, they wanted to charge us $1 for some Chinese sauerkraut that's supposed to already be part of the dish! For the record, my sister, who has eaten here numerous times, says it depends on who you ask. This inconsistency makes me even more upset. I'm not about to give a lecture on fairness, but hey, even a kid can tell it's not right. Overall, they do have pretty yummy beef noodle soup, but bear in mind it's also missing an integral part of the dish. Please start serving Chinese sauerkraut with your soup!! At least as an option on the side??

Since moving to NorCal in September of last year, this has been our go-to favorite. Me and hubby LOVE the food here. Hubby gets the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup every single time. Those thick noodles are apparently handmade daily...and I love the bite back you get when you eat them. Slightly chewy and never tough or soggy. As for me...because I am a porky little piggy, I get the family combo. It's a separate sheet they give you with the menu- pick 3 items for $22.99. Always always always get the Salt and Pepper Chicken. It is PERFECT. Also...the combination fried rice is superb. It usually comes with a generous quantity of all kinds of meat in it (beef, pork, chicken, shrimp). However, I prefer it vegetarian- chopped up bits of zucchini and carrot and cabbage. I like a veggie to round out the unhealthiness...usually get the dry braised string beans but the veggie mixture is tasty if you like that clear savory sauce on veggies (not too sure what it is). And when you get that combo, you get to pick between a scallion cake or white rice. Don't forget to peruse the Tea Era menu while you're ordering so you can bypass the line next door!

We ordered the spicy beef noodle soup and chow fun. The soup lived up to its reputation. I'll definitely be visiting this place after a long night of drinking. The noodles were nice and thick and the broth had just the right amount of spice. The beef was a little bit fatty, but it was tender and flavorful. I would have given four stars, but the chow fan was very bland. Service was great. The place is pretty small so you might have to wait. The tea place next door also has very good bubble tea that you can order while you eat here.

Inexpensive and delicious Taiwanese food!! :D :D Five stars for the delicious Taiwanese beef tendon noodle soup. ?I find myself craving it on a regular basis.. and having to give into the cravings. ?Seriously, no one does tendons like Queen's House does, LOL. ?I think this is basically the only thing I've tried here (It's just too good to waste a visit ordering anything else IMO)... Service is very quick for hungry people like me :) Another convenient thing is that you can order pearl tea from Tea Era from the restaurant, since they are both connected. ?Tea Era is HANDS DOWN my fav. milk tea place. ? The only thing I don't like about this restaurant is that it's a little small and closed on Tuesdays (which is, for some reason, usually the day I end up wanting it). ?

In my unyielding quest to find decent Chinese food in the South Bay area, I came across Queen's House as I wandered through the area. My #1 item here, without doubt, is the spicy beef noodo soup. It has a rich broth that will make even the most calloused mouth flinch. The noodo's are thick and cooked perfectly - easily the best asian noodle I have ever had. After eating a massive bowl of this soup, I walk out feeling like an atomic bomb of nourishment and splendor. They have really good salt and pepper chicken too. I love the eggrolls, but my wife says they are too greasy...I see that as a positive thing. go here.

QUEEN'S HOUSE This is one of the run-of-the-mill Chinese restaurants that permeate the greater Bay Area, but it's in prime real estate location in downtown Castro. The restaurants boasts a large menu for such a small establishment. They have some decent noodles here, like the minced pork dry noodles. If you're in for family style, look no further than their 3 Item for $22.95 menu, where you can choose from a large selection. The deal comes with either steamed rice or scallion cakes. We chose the General Tsao Chicken (a bit more sweet than typical), salt/pepper fish (too bland), and the garlic pea sprouts (excellent)! The scallion cakes were a bit too dry, but otherwise, made for a good substitution to the steamed rice. Queen's House also boasts a large selection of peal tea drinks, of which I will have to try next time. Staff is friendly. The restaurant is a bit too small to be really comfy, though; the tables for two people are super small!!! Come here for a nice Chinese meal and enjoy a walk in downtown Mountain View to walk off all the food sitting in your hungry belly!

Last time I came to the area, I went to Liang's Village and was wowed by the noodles. ?This time I decided to try somewhere new (and continue exploring more of the area). ?Queen's House came highly recommended, and it was pretty good, but it wasn't really awe inspiring. ? We started with a fried tofu dish. ?Good, but unspectacular. ?And I can get that in CT. ?I had to order the beef noodle soup to compare with Liang's. ?The beef is far superior to Liang's. ?It's tender and falling apart, whereas Liang's was a little on the tougher side. ?But the noodles didn't have the same wow-factor as Liang's. ?I wish I could combine the two!

Super delicious! Solid place! 1. Cheap 2. Delicious 3. Fast service I went here with a friend during work time. We got there during lunch hours about 11:30 am - so it didn't get crowded until around the time we were leaving. This is a place for solid Chinese/Taiwanese dishes. We order the Szechuan beef noodle soup. I've definitely had my fair share of beef noodle soups. This was an amazing combination of your typical Taiwanese beef noodle soup with a szechuan touch. Needless to say, I was impressed. This soup was $6-7 ONLY. Amazing deal. Huge portions. Definitely will return.

Queen's House is a solid choice - although to be fair, I haven't tried any of the other Chinese places around downtown Castro. I've been here a couple times though, and it does a good job of hitting the spot. What I like to order: * Beef noodle soup * Green onion pancake * Three cup tofu (This is my fav here!) * Any lightly saut¨¦ed Chinese veggie The waiters are conversant in both English and Mandarin Chinese. Parking is not that great unless you park a little farther away. There's a take-out option, if you don't want to sit inside the small restaurant. Cap off the meal with some boba from Tea Era, and you'll be good to go.

Was going to give a "Meh" (2-star) rating until I ate at Southland Cafe in Cupertino Village. Though the oyster vermicelli isn't the same as the ones in Taiwan, it's at least closer to the real taste than the one at Southland Cafe. Oh also the green onion/scallion pancake tasted wrong - not sure if it was stale or what - hope that was just a one-time thing. The you-fan (oil rice?) was good, but that's hard to mess up. Gah, I'll still be back for the oyster vermicelli until I find another place that actually offers it and doesn't suck.

This used to be a good little hole in the wall. Now the service, attitude and food sucks big time. I had my last meal on Friday, and I'm never returning. Food came out of the kitchen faster than at McDonald's. The seafood tasted more rubbery than a Big Mac. And the shredded pork &amp; tofu smelled like it came from the urinal. Yucks.

Right next to Tea Era (or connected to) score! ?Not the best nor the worse Chinese food joint I've tried in N. California. I think like most Chinese places you have to find the right dishes to order. ?I've had fails and pretty good ones. BF loves the SWEET and SOUR SHRIMP, its on the sweet side...not so much sour. ?The BEEF and BROCCOLI is a regular dish I order, pretty good. ?KUNG PAO CHICKEN wasn't really up my alley. ?I do enjoy the CURRY CHICKEN too. Pass on the WONTON soup....way too oily for me to be satisfying. ?Also pass on the COMBINATION FRIED RICE, it was very bland. I'm not a fried rice person but their SHRIMP fried rice is pretty tasty. Check out their dinner special menu, I believe it's 3 dishes for $22-$23. STAFF: Pretty ASIAN BATHROOM: None SEATING: ?Wooden tables and chairs, a narrow restaurant with limited seating.

I can definitely say that the waiters here are very asian. I can say that because when I try to speak to them / order in chinese, they respond in english. I can't really speak chinese at all but I can speak food, so credit where credit is due for sleuthing me out here. Actually only recently started eating here again. The first time I was every here (back in the days of yonder) I tried to sit with a group of friends but just get some fried rice. They kicked me out of the restaurant for not covering the minimum charge. However the place has a P/Q ratio that is too good not to eat at. Or rather, I can say that one dish in particular is too good not to eat (I generally always get the hong shao niu rou mian). So when I give this place 4 stars, please know that I'm evaluating one dish at 4 stars. That's just how I roll. Also, you can get pmt/boba when you go here. For the addicts out there.

General Tso's tofu - delicious. ?Perfectly cooked. ?Perfectly sauced. Broccoli w/ Spicy garlic sauce - addictive. ?Savored every bite. Hunan tofu - This dish grew on me. ?At first, I favored the first two but this one got better with time. ?Still not sure I'd order it again...it was the monthly special. Scallion cake was nothing special and could have used more scallions! ? Tea = good. Service was generally good. ? The amount of food and the taste are bargains to me. ?This is now a go-to place for me! Looks like I'll be spending more time at the queen's house. ?Hope the king and prince don't mind.

All of the requirements for a good Asian noodle places are met here. ?It's cramped, noisy, dirty, and cheap. ?The Sichuan spicy beef noodle soup is loads better here than other places, it left me feeling sweaty and with a certain trembling in my nethers. ?I wouldn't want it any other way. ?Granted it's not the flavor explosion broth-wise that is available actually in Sichuan, but what are you going to do? I like being given my own teapot when I sit down too. ?I don't know what kind of tea it is, and I don't care. It has a slight taste of dish water, but I come to expect and enjoy that. When I'm busy assaulting my GI tract, the taste of tea isn't so important, rather it just being available is the key.

I was really disappointed by the food taste/quality for dinner here once and didn't plan on coming back. ? Then I heard rave reviews about the spicy beef noodle soup (niu ro mien). ?I hadn't had that in forever and decided to give Queen's House another chance. ?And YES! soooo good. ?The perfect amount of spiciness for me, and the noodles were al dente (what's the Chinese equivalent?) to my liking. ?The beef was very flavorful as well, though a bit too much tendon for my taste. I also ordered the green onion pancake, and it was not too great. Not thick and not much green onion. I feel like the frozen ones I get from 99 Ranch are just as good. Overall, the Beef Noodel Soup gets Queen's House the 3 stars. ?Everything else is pretty forgettable.

I stopped here for late dinner last night after attending Global Winter Wonderland. It's a nice, somewhat small restaurant with a good Taiwanese menu. When I visit Taiwanese restaurant almost the first thing I look for on the menu is fried stinky tofu, but too bad they don't serve it here. I went for the squid noodle in thick soup. This may be the first time I had thick soup, I guess it's something Taiwanese, and it was delicious. The squid were actually pieces of tentacles and such inside fish stuffing. I wasn't expecting that but it was a good experience. The hostess was very nice but the other staff could have been more attentive because I waited a bit long for my order to be taken. Therefore, a solid 3+ stars. This restaurant would definitely be a consideration if I'm in or passing by Mountain View and want to eat on or around Castro Street.

My family has tried probably every Chinese restaurant in the bay area, looking for something up to par. Places come and go, so it's hard. However, this is a staple in my family's dinner plans--we never go out to eat, with the few exceptions including when we go to this place once a week. Let me tell you, if you follow these instructions, you will be SO satisfied with delicious Chinese food. Get the beef noodle soup--the beef in this is incredible. SO tender and not too fatty (you have to embrace the fattiness). The green onion pancake is incredible, a perfect addition to your meal. Hands down the best part--the ants crawling up a tree / some sort of mung bean noodle with ground pork. Amazing and hands down the best I've ever had. The combination fried rice is also great (from someone who hates Americanized Chinese food, this is saying a lot. Best Chinese in the bay area--you won't go wrong.

Call me crazy. We tried this again. Szechuan beef noodle soup was at first bite, homey and hit the spot. But I was HANGRY by the time we sat down. After the second bite, the grease starts to get to you and as with my first experience, the noodles start to get mushier and mushier and I could not eat more than ~10 bites. The chicken with black bean sauce was also good on the first bite and then raw onion pieces start to annoy you and you start to see the pool of grease that it's sitting in. The fried onion pancake had a nice crisp but as one of our dining companions said, it lacked flavor so you have to dip it in some sort of soup or grease. I do not get the buzz about this place.

Not bad at all!!! I wasn't impressed with this place a few years ago when I visited but when I came here the other night, I felt that this place has much improved. We ordered lots of pretty standard Taiwanese/Chinese dishes: green beans, tofu clay pot, spicy beef noodle soup, and this one spicy pork dish. Fried green onion pancake was really good too! The rice was free because we had a party of 5 and ordered a lot of food (not sure if they always give this out as a freebie, though). Another plus: I didn't feel exceptionally thirsty after dinner which means they didn't go apeshit on me with the MSG. Thank you Queen's House for not completely bastardizing perfectly good Chinese food that can pass fine with some light sauces and salt. And yet it was soooo tasty. I'm normally averse to the idea of trying Chinese restaurants these days largely because of the aforementioned reason (too much MSG) and a lot of the places are just dirty and they don't give a shit. Looking at the store front, you're likely to write this place off for being just that. It's not, thankfully. Though, I'd give this place a B for service. For the first few minutes I was standing at the entrance while they walked up and down without acknowledging me. This place gets an A for food taste and quality though!

Queen's House is probably one of the most frequented Chinese restaurants that I go to since I live close by and the food is pretty standard. ?This place is packed most of the time so if there is a line up remember to add your name to the clipboard on the door. I find that the majority of food that I've had was good/passable but no real stand outs. ?Service is quick and to the point. Some dishes that I've had: The dan dan noodles were the biggest disappointment for me. ?I'm used to a peanut-y flavour thick soup and this one only had the slightest peanut taste and I think they added too much stuff to it. ?They had water chestnuts and mushrooms which took over the dish so it didn't really taste like dan dan noodles. The garlic pea sprouts were also a disappointment. ?It was very chewy making it hard to eat. ?For a table of four people, we left about half of it untouched. The beef noodle soup is good though. It comes spicey as well if you want more of a kick. ?Large chunks of tender beef with bok choy in a bowl of thick noodles. I also really like their green onion pancakes which are pan fried perfectly. Bubble tea is also available and they get it from Tea Era which is next door. Apparently these two places have the same owner.

Among the many Asian restaurants on Castro, Queen's House is a tiny strip next door to Tea Era (same owners?) They have more traditional Taiwanese dishes like oyster pancake (with egg, cornstarch, sweet chili sauce, which makes the dish), oyster noodle soup (a thickened soup with thin noodles), sticky rice (again, generic sauce makes the dish), spicy beef noodle soup, and of course, fried pork chop over rice. As much as I love Asian vegetables, i generally try to avoid sauteed greens and eggplant at Chinese restaurants, since they can be super greasy. The oyster pancake (which I prefer to get with shrimp) is pretty greasy, and it has way too much cornstarch in it. ?The 5 spice beef (Cold plate) is not bad, but it's expensive for what it is (maybe my perception is skewed because I was recently in Asia). Cash only if it's under $10. I am tempted to come back for Taiwanese breakfast on the weekends, since I've been craving fried dough wrapped in baked dough (shao bing you tiao) haha.

On my last night in Mountain View before moving, my boyfriend and I were craving Chinese food so of course we turned to Yelp to help us find the best one on Castro St. Unfortunately, everything seemed to be 3.5 stars. So we had a crazy idea, let's visit 4 Chinese restaurants and order 1 item at each and then compare! (Side note: I do not recommend this...) Queen's House was our second stop. I frequently visit the bubble tea place right next to this restaurant and always see people going in and out so I figured it would be crowded. It was so crowded and noisy it was almost impossible to hold a conversation across the table. On to the food, we noticed at the bottom of the menu that a $5 minimum per person. Since we only wanted 1 dish, that was not going to fly with our waitress. We added the eggrolls which might have swung the pendulum in this restaurant's favor as I LOVE eggrolls with an unhealthy passion. We also ordered the mu shu beef. The food came out quickly which was nice, and I thought it was pretty good. Not really good, but pretty good. Service was ok. No one came to check on us at all but it was easy to flag down a server as they walked by for whatever we needed. All in all, I'd say it was pretty good but nothing to rush back for.

Even though I lived in Mountain View for a year, and frequented the downtown, I only heard about this place recently by reading a review of it in the newspaper. ?This is probably due to the fact that it's a very unassuming little restaurant and if you blink, you'll miss it. ?The reviewer said he'd tried the place more than once because the first time he went, he didn't like what he ordered, and couldn't understand why there was a line out the front door. ? We probably should have followed his suggestions, but, oh well. ?He said he learned that the soup is the way to go there. ?They do have quite a variety of soups. ?We ordered the Taiwanese Combo noodle soup and it was pretty good. ?Much thicker noodles than Ramen or pho. ?They're also homemade. ?We also ordered egg rolls which were pretty good. ?The thing we didn't like at all was the General's Chicken. ?The chicken was super dry :( ?I'd dare to say it was almost worse than a similar chicken dish at Panda Express (sorry!). ? So the advice we didn't follow from the review was to stick to ordering the soup and noodle dishes, as those are their specialty. ?I will definitely be back to try more of their soups and hopefully their noodle dishes, as well. ?So beware, if you order anything else, you're ordering at your own risk! OH, also, the waitresses were super duper nice! ?Love when that happens, since it seems to be more the exception than the rule these days. Oh, but the counter where we ate was super sticky. ?Ew :(

Second stop of four Chinese restaurants off Castro St. in Mountain View. I had always noticed Queen's House to have people coming in and out, but had never gone inside. It's not a pretty restaurant inside, with tables pretty cramped together and lots of hand-written signs all over the place. It's also pretty busy, a little cramped, and can get a little noisy. A plus is that you can order bubble tea in the restaurant from the attached bubble tea place next door (which is really tasty). Sadly, no pot of tea provided (and no fortune cookies at the end of the meal). We ordered egg rolls and the mu shu beef. Both were great. It's hard to go wrong with egg rolls, and the sweet and sour sauce was good. The mu shu beef was a sizable portion (definitely enough to be split between two people for a decent meal). The eggrolls and mu shu beef couldn't have come to more than $13. Awesomely cheap! One nice thing about the small size of the restaurant and the overall busy nature of the place is that it's easy to grab a server's attention when you need something. They were prompt in responding and were nice enough to give us sauce to go when we took a leftover box with us. Overall verdict: Bustling restaurant with tasty, cheap Chinese food.

Really great joint in downtown MV to get some Chinese and Taiwanese eats. ?Their Szechuan beef noodle soup is awesome if you could tolerate hot foods. ?Otherwise, they have another non-spicy version, perhaps even with beef tendons if you wish and they are also very delicious. They also do homestyle 3-entree (or more) combos for cheap. ?Their small dish/appetizer selection (mostly savory and some served cold) are pretty cool. Don't let people dissuade you from trying out this place -- it's authentically Chinese and both the services and sanitory level are above average. ?They accept credit cards for $10 or higher.

This review is just for beef noodle soup. Its sad that the beef noodle soup in Davis is better than it is here. From the moment my spicy beef noodle soup came out, I was worried because it was bathing in oily broth! From the first spoonful to the last, grease stuck to my lips. I will admit that the amount of beef was substantial...or was it? The ratio of fat to beef was seriously 60/40. I enjoy my soup to be crisp and refreshing, not oily and I'd rather have less quantity of quality beef rather than more of beef I could barely eat. I spit a lot of pieces out. Yes, I know, how lady like of me :). In conclusion, I was highly disappointed and would only eat this gain if someone paid more $20 at a minimum. The total cost was $7.20 plus tip. Not worth it unless you are a huge fat and oil lover!

This place totally reminds me of a restaurant I used to love in Irvine while I was in school. It's a tiny place with pretty decent Taiwanese food for a pretty good price. If you're feeling super asian during lunch or dinner I would go here out of all the places on castro. This place or HK Bistro fills my asia needs and I'm chinese so I know good small chinese eats :D This is not a place if you want exceptional chinese food. Nor is it a place to expect good service. It is a great place if you want a quick bite of super asian food for a few bucks.

Preamble: ?Just as Fu Lam Mum has conflicting street addresses in different media, QH has two name spellings. ?Menus and neon sign say QUEEN house, but Yellow Pages and Yelp for most of its history had it possessive: Queen's. ? (Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that: Yelp's listing has now changed from "Queen's" to "Queen," breaking existing links to it.) Queen House is a family-run inexpensive restaurant, friendly folks, Taiwanese and noodle specialties, MANY noodle soups, filled dumplings. ?Small: QH gets crowded at peak times. ?Lunch crowd thins out later than most on Castro St., so 1:15 weekdays you MIGHT get a table at once; 1:30, almost always. ?Closed TUESDAYS. ?I've found its dumplings decent, its noodles themselves very sound. Four dumpling types are also sold frozen in bags of 45 at $15-$18, advertised on a Chinese menu atop cash-register counter, which staff will happily explain. ?Frozen dumplings are a famous QH feature, some local residents have relied on them for years. Recently I got cooked dumplings and (intrigued by Ken K's report from Hangen), dan dan noodles (d¨¤n d¨¤n mi¨¤n), Chengdu's famous street food. ?The noodles came packed separately -- thick, chewy, well cooked examples of local fresh Chinese noodles. ?(I served some directly with the sauce, the rest in a soup I made with tender greens, the sauce as topping.) ?As you'll see below, I thought QH's version of dan dan pleasant enough, but not notable or Sichuanese. ?For nearby Sichuanese specialties done well, see Chef Zhao: http://www.yelp.com/biz/¡­ ? QH also has advertised on wall posters a "garlic basil and bacon chow mein or fried rice with black pepper," $7.99 -- must try that soon. I've had almost as many different interpretations of "dan dan noodles" as restaurants where tried. ?Dunlop's _Land of Plenty_ cookbook says "dan dan" originally didn't connote any single recipe at all, but the vendors' bamboo shoulder poles. ?Her "traditional" version has spicy seasonings, hua jiao, and Sichuanese pickled mustard green (ya cai) tossed with the noodles -- NO sesame paste -- and a little meat. ?Dunlop includes one chef's variation, with sesame paste. ?The Chiang/Schrecker cookbook vividly, appetizingly, describes the dish's origin, and a recipe with sesame paste and hua jiao. ?Queen House's version recently had a thickened sauce, not unpleasant, with a little sesame paste, crunchy ingredients and mushrooms, moderately spicy, no detectable hua jiao seasoning. ? I then made dan dan noodles at home from Dunlop's "traditional" recipe, WITH hua jiao and preserved Sichuan vegetables, and thick fresh noodles (sold refrigerated nearby at Ava's Downtown Market). ?The homemade version, with simple condiments, spices, and fresh scallions, blew away any restaurant dan dan noodles I've tried, it was much fresher and more alive. ? The gap between most restaurant versions and what you can easily home-cook, contrasts sharply with my local experience of ma po tofu, a Sichuanese dish easy to make well (just four core ingredients). ?For Sichuanese specialties, stick to Sichuanese cooks! ?Update: Since Summer 2012 a skilled Sichuanese chef has made excellent authentic d¨¤n d¨¤n mi¨¤n at Chef Zhao: ?http://www.yelp.com/biz/¡­ More LOCAL comparisons (updated 3/13): Chef Liu, competitor for noodle specialties across Castro from QH, was already known online for fresh noodles before Yelp existed (though QH offers a larger range of _soups_ with such noodles): http://www.yelp.com/biz/¡­ ? For comforting Cantonese menu and long hours every day, Kirin: http://www.yelp.com/biz/¡­ ? Fu Lam Mum (FLM) http://www.yelp.com/biz/¡­ ? is the local dim sum specialty place, though QH, itself somewhat dumpling-focused, gives FLM a run for its money on those, with fewer kinds and without FLM's big tea-house format. ?Chef Xiu on El Camino http://www.yelp.com/biz/¡­ ?is a compact place with capable kitchen and Dongbei specialties. ?Slightly farther away, humble-looking but Michelin-recommended Bamboo Garden http://www.yelp.com/biz/¡­ ?serves up authentic Shanghai cooking (including outstanding Shanghainese dumplings, XLB and others) at strikingly moderate prices. The only two of the 10 downtown-MV Chinese restaurants where I've been seriously let down are Hong Kong Bistro (repeatedly) and Hangen (though just in one recent meal, very disappointing after Hangen's relabeling of itself as "Sichuan" prompted us to try some Sichuan dishes there).

The beef stew was off the hook! ?The beef was tender and the noodles were nice and chewy. ?This noodle soup is perfect for a cold day! ?You can get this with or without the tendons...I opted for no tendons. ?This bowl can probably feed two people if you get other side dishes. ?I wasn't able to eat all the noodles since I also stuffed myself with the Scallion Cake and Pork Buns. ?All the food was super good!!! ? Definitely get here early because this place is small! ?And parking can be tough, so you might be circling for a while. ?Now I have a reason to come to Mountain View.....other than concerts at Shoreline. ?=)

This is where my sister comes to cheat on her vegetarian lifestyle with some good ole spicy beef noodle soup. Apparently it's that good that once a month or so, she forgets she was ever vegetarian and dines on a hearty bowl of this soup. ?I on the other hand, remain true to my lifestyle of beef restriction and ended up eating family style dishes. I'm not sure what other people were talking about with respect to bad service because when I came here, it was pretty efficient and quick. ?The quality of the food was a little heavy on the salt, but to be honest, I'm actually halophilic (well, I don't like to live in salty environments, rather I just like salt) so i do well with salty foods. There has to be something wonderful about this place that keeps people like my mom and my sister coming back for more (it could also be the cheap prices....always a hit with our family).

There are now four different tasting/looking broths of beef noodle soup you can get here Curry beef Tomato beef - not bad if you want a little tomato flavor in your bowl Sichuan spicy (chuan wei) Regular (hong shao), not spicy - safe standard order With your choice of beef (brisket cut, not shank...booooo), tendons, or both together in the same bowl. Probably the only joint in town serving tomato beef noodle soup that I know of (without having to resort to Wei Chuan's frozen tomato beef noodle soup, manufactured in Southern California, not bad for a frozen rendition with low 4 digit readings of sodium levels), and although not a stellar execution, it's acceptable for a quick fix, provided that you don't think of the succulent delicious works of art that the beef noodle specialist shops execute in Taiwan with passion and fire. Don't even think about comparing this bowl with San Tung, A&J, ASJ, Mama Chen, 5 Joy, ?Chinjin Eastern House yada yada burp. Haven't tried the curry one yet, but don't expect fireworks. Hopefully not coming out the backside afterwards. In essence, I believe these folks do one central beef broth or stock. The stewed beef (brisket) seems to be a bit heavy handed with the rock sugar that spills into the broth. You want spicy? They just drizzle a layer of chili oil on top, throw in some spicy hot chili peppers (don't bite unless you want the abuse) and voila. Hot, spicy, and a strange sweet aftertaste that still burns your lips a little. As far as the tomato beef...I think the tomato flavor is added on top of the beef stock. Curry? Well that's probably from their stock curry sauce for rice plates, maybe mixed in the the base stock. Same chewy thick starchy noodle whose only purpose is to try and fill you up as quickly as possible, same spinach, same beef, same tendons. The tendons are humongous, a tad bit chewy at times if you are into that. Then wash all that chit down by going next door to Tea Era.

We've not eaten at Queen House for a few years now, ever since we moved away from Mountain View actually. Due to nostalgia and the fact that we didn't know where else to go as it was kinda late for lunch, so we decided upon Queen House. I was surprised they renovated -- I guess they did it quite a while ago, we just haven't been around to witness it. The menu pretty much remains the same. We got the cold chicken noodles with sesame sauce, 'yu xiang che zi' (eggplant in yu xiang sauce), 'hung shao tofu' (braised tofu) and kung pao shrimp. We had a friend with us so he ordered some of the dishes as well. The food arrived relatively fast and I don't know what it is, but it just didn't taste the same as I remembered. I thought maybe things had changed in the years since we'd been gone, but it was the same owners and surprisingly, the chef was still the same as well. I know this because they recognized us and started chatting with us commenting on how big the young man has gotten and how they didn't recognize him anymore. I'm wondering if we used to come here a lot because of how close we had gotten to the owners and chef and now, after being away so long, the food is just really quite average. Still, we enjoyed being around familiar surroundings and although the food was just so-so, it was a lovely experience nonetheless.

Two of sh!t is sh!t. ?if they really want to f**$ you they'll give you three of these things. ?Those immortal words from Dennis Miller's standup days never rang so true here. ?It doesn't matter how cheap the food is, if it's not good so what if you get a lot of it? ?The Girl wanted eggplant but they were out. ?Seriously, who runs out of eggplant at 4pm on a Saturday? ?The place was crowded but kinda small. ?We waited at least 10 minutes for two dishes which ended up being completely forgettable. ? We had some leftovers and when I checked them in the fridge the next day, the oil had completely absorbed through the boxes. ?Seriously, what's the point of waxed boxes? ?But imagine if it wasn't waxed, I guess it would have added to the texture. The only redeeming quality is that they apparently co-own Tea Era next door, which serves awesome teas.

Wow....seriously this is the worst Chinese food I have ever had! I've had better at Chinese places in a Mall. I ordered Mongolian Beef that was weird in color and no flavor.

Ode to Queen House... (Spring 2008 update) Back in the day when I first moved here from Chicago, Queen House was like heaven. Taiwanese food is hard to find in the Midwest and here I was, confronted with an honest to goodness Taiwanese restaurant that served street food. Stinky tofu. Minced pork over rice. Popcorn chicken. Beef & beef tendon noodle soup. Plus, they had a great dinner menu - 3 dishes for $18 - and their interior transported me back to the mother island. Walking through the kitchen to get to the bathroom. Of course they rated 5 stars. In the intervening time, QH has much of some of its luster and, now, a couple stars. The ambiance has changed with their remodeling - with the addition of the benches and small bar, there's more of a lounge-y feel and not so much the small, homey Taiwanese restaurant. Their overall food quality has become more wildly variable and their prices have gone up. And they no longer serve stinky tofu. Sadness. While it pains me to downgrade them so much, you gotta do whatcha gotta do. I still really like their street food selection and their dinner menu is still a pretty good deal (3 for $20), though not quite the awesome deal it used to be. The beef noodle soup doesn't quite hold up to other places around the Bay anymore though decent in a pinch. Their version of minced pork over rice still brings tears to my eyes and is arguably the best in the Bay and arguably the main reason I keep coming back. 4 stars for the Taiwanese street food, 3-3.5 stars for $20 menu, depending on the day. Current favorites... Popcorn chicken (yan su ji) Three cup chicken (san bei ji) Salt & pepper fish or spareribs (jiao yan yu pian/pai gu) Spinach/pea sprout w/ garlic (da suan bo tsai/dou miao) Family style tofu (jia chang dou fu) Green onion pancake (cong you bing) Pork in the thick w/ rice noodle (rou geng mi fen) Pork chop over rice (pai guu fan) Taiwanese style chopped pork over rice (luu rou fan)

Confucius say... "When in restaurant, the more sucky the service, the more tasty the food..." Confucius knows what's up because over here, we had to ask for forks twice, ask for plates in order to share our chicken curry three times, set out a flare to the waitresses to get some water, literally beg for napkins, amongst other things, etc. It's like dude, c'mon can't you see I'm like right here waving at you and I've asked you a bunch of times already?!!?! But you know what, it was worth it. I'd go through that headache again to have some of their braised beef tendon noodle soup. Tendon might scare some folks off if you're not used to the texture. The texture is a little like jello like with a bite but it has this organic, super meaty, beefy flavor. Not to be outdone by the tendons but the spicy beef broth is insanely good and beefy too. Thinking about that broth makes me want to start moo-ing. Got Milk?

Queen House has the best stir-fried green beans I have ever eaten. ? The scallion pancakes are also amazing. So is the cashew chicken. I eat here very often. ?Sometimes friends call to ask if I want to go to Queen House, and I tell them I'm answering their call from a table at Queen House.

Inter-Asian dating in the Bay Area: A young Chinese woman sat at a table near us with her Japanese-American boyfriend. ?How did I know he was Japanese? ?Because I grew up in that culture and...he thought the white one paw waving cat on the counter was Hello Kitty. ? But here's the thing--she clearly took one for the team. ?She indulged her man and ordered shrimp fried rice, fried won ton chips, and sweet and sour chicken. ? That's true love. Queen's House is a Taiwanese restaurant, not your everyday American-Chinese joint. ?OK, it's not like being in Taiwan, they no longer have stinky tofu, but the patrons are mostly Chinese speaking. ?They order gelatinous goo with chili sauce, small bone chicken pieces in garlic and ginger, Chinese doughnuts, and soy milk soup. ?Hard core, man. To give up the goods, ignore the Chinese menu, and order dishes you can find at any American-Chinese joint----this had to be true love.

So the wifey was gettin' a Formosa fix again (I can always tell when she's going through Taiwanese food withdrawl by the way she starts seizing and drooling like a drugged-up monkey). As stated numerous times before, there is no decent Taiwanese food in SF. ?Don't try to argue with me, you'll only lose. We'd heard through the grapevine that a little hole-in-the-wall place existed over in downtown Mountain View. ?Since wifey drags me to Milpitas for her weekly Taiwan drug habit, I figger that the drive wasn't an issue. The restaurant in located in a bustling area in Mountain View's quaint "downtown" district". ?The whole street is lined with various eateries with surprising variety. ?Architecturally, the street ?was reminiscent of watching an episode of "The Andy Griffith Show" with the small-town Mayberry feel (I think I dated myself with that TV reference). Interior is all business. ?The menu is a mix of Chinese and Taiwanese specialties. ?Most of the authentic Taiwanese stuff is offered only on weekends though. The food is quite good, but priced a bit higher than the South Bay Taiwanese competition. ?My control dish is the minced pork rice. ?I order this at every Taiwanese restaurant to make a valid comparison. ?Queen's House version is nicely done with big chunks of fatty pork which aren't overwhelmed by soy sauce or buried in pickled veggies. Wifey ordered the oyster pancake... Let me say that oyster pancake is uniquely Taiwanese and definitely an acquired taste. ?The texture is akin to raw snails cooked over an egg omlette and then drizzled with extra slime. ?I managed about 4 bites before the sliminess made me gag... uggh. ?Silly Taiwanese! Anyway, this place will do if you're craving for some traditional Formosan food. ?I much prefer Ay-chung noodle in Milpitas because it's cheaper and more in keeping with my Cantonese sensibilities. Silly Taiwanese!

Finally, I've found a place with great prices, speedy service, and very tasty Chinese food in Downtown Mountain View! ? I know, I know...Queen's House isn't new, but it is to me and I really ended up liking this place. ? A couple of friends invited us here and although I had heard of Queen's House, I had never had a meal there. ?With the sweltering heat, I decided it was time to abandon the home kitchen (haha) and give this place a try. Queen's House is actually quite easy to miss along Castro Street. ?Located next to a Tea Era shop that they co-own (and allow you to bring food or drink from), there is a bright neon sign on the window, but somehow, compared to all the fancier places opening up along Castro Street, it's extremely easy to walk pass or simply drive by. ?The interior, while simple, has been recently redecorated and is comfortably low key. ? The star here at Queen's House is clearly the prices. ?A special $19.99 menu for 3 items greets you upon entry and a variety of Chinese dishes are offered. ?If you have a party greater than 3 people, you will need to order an extra dish for each guest at $6.59. ?White rice or scallion pancakes are included with all these special orders. On the back of the special menu, there is a menu with all Chinese characters with the same $19.99 deal. ?Observant patrons will note that the English version has 38 items and the Chinese version has 48 items. ?Conspiracy theorists and foodies who worry that the Chinese menu has the "better" dishes can rest assured. ?The menus are essentially the same and the additions on the Chinese menu include things like intestines and other exotic organs; things that we didn't order and may be worthwhile to try only if you are adventurous. ?Bottom line: I don't think you're missing out not reading Chinese. ?It's for your protection! ? ? ? We ended up ordering four items for our party of four: 1) Wintermelon and Virginia Ham Soup - delicious and brothy, the soup balanced the the Virginia ham which added a nice amount of saltiness without overpowering the wintermelon 2) Salt and Pepper spareribs - tasty and piping hot, the ribs were not overly soaked in oil as at many places and the fried onions and peppers were fresh, tasty, and tangy 3) "Three Cup" Chicken - nice and crispy, the chicken was extremely flavorful and the sauce was a great addition to white rice. ?The chicken pieces were all wings, so took a bit longer to eat, but were well worth it. 4) Bean Sprouts - a healthy vegetable dish that was ok. ?A bit dry and could have used more garlic. ?The weakest dish of the bunch *) Rice - an absolutely enormous bowl of white rice was brought to the table. ?While edible, I have to comment that the clumps and warmish nature lead me to believe this rice had been cooked in large vats and a long time ago. ?Anyone can make better rice than this. ? Overall, despite the rice, I had an enjoyable (and cheap) meal. ?It came out to $8/person (with tip!) and all the entrees were comfort food. ?The best part is that with 48 items, you will no doubt be able to mix and match to your heart's desire and definitely still be able to eat affordably. ?As well, after the meal and despite the sweltering heat, I did not find myself parched or with a headache; side effects I get from the addition of excessive MSG. ? I will have to visit Queen's House several more times to make sure that it is able to consistently put out the same quality and also to try the well reviewed hand made noodles in their noodle soups. ?But nonetheless, as I write this review on Yelp, I'm happy to find a place with really cheap and really good Chinese food. ?Fu Lam Mum used to occupy that late night throne, but their recent renovation suggests they have gone upscale as much as Castro Street has. ?While I am always impressed with how far downtown Castro has come, it's nice to have a place that is more low key and has simpler fare. Finally, for those who argue that there is a plethora of such places, I would argue that I've been disappointed with the rest. ?Shanghai Family Restaurant comes close, but it's location across the railroad tracks is not as convenient as a downtown location. ?Cafe Yulong served mediocre fare my visit and I'd be hard pressed to go again. ?And finally Chef Liu, despite the crowds, price and location in the middle of downtown, was the most disappointing of all: bland, flavorless dishes remarkable only in their portion size. ?Queen's House stands out among all of them and I'd say is a solid 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 stars. ? They supposedly just recently started taking credit cards, but do not take American Express.

My first Queen House experience was when my family and I came to "the Castro" for Colonel Lee's mongolian barbeque across the street on a weekend only to discover that it was closed. ?So, on a tip from our pals, we wondered across the street to QH, and ducked in and lucked into a table for 4 (it was packed). The lunch menu had a special for 3 entree's with rice or scallion cakes (which everyone seems to order) for 18 bucks. ?Game on. ?We had to get the rice as that's about the only food my 2 year old will reliably eat (damn him). ?So, can't comment on the scallion cakes, but they look good. OK, cutting to the chase, we've been back 4 times and it's now our go-to place on Castro (sorry Col. Lee). ?The General's Chicken is incredible -- and as mentioned, is a generous helping of breast meat lightly fried in a sweet/spicy sauce that makes your mouth water. ?We've had mostly good luck with other dishes, but with the kid factor, haven't been too ambitious beyond the basic but reliably good cashew chicken, etc. ?We also now get the potstickers to go with the 3 entree's and that's quite a meal. Net net... crowded and small atmosphere, scrumptious food, and great bargain. ?Did I mention kid and family friendly??? ?There's even a gelato place next door to bribe your munchkins with.

My favorite authentic Chinese/Taiwanese place in the area (keyword: authentic). I would eat here everyday if I could! My favorites are the pork and chive dumplings, the scallion cakes, and the sweet rice cooked in barrel dish. The soups/noodles/won ton are quite good too. One my fave Taiwanese dishes is vermicelli with oysters but it's not so good here. I guess nothing can really compare to the real deal, off a cart on the street from Taiwan :) *** Don't go here to order regular American dishes like beef broccoli or kung pao chicken, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment. This isn't a Chinese-American restaurant, so don't expect fortune cookies either, that's just dumb. I recommend ordering something you've never heard of/never tried, you probably won't be disappointed. Branching out here is a good thing. *** Service is very fast. The place is small and decor is sparse. Everything can be ordered for take-out. They're closed on Tuesdays (which is a bummer). They don't take AMEX. Prices are super low, dishes average at $5-6. And portions are generous. LOOOVE this place! ====================================== Sigh...I must remove 1 star. Their quality of service while dining in is steadily declining. Maybe it was the people I've had recently but I sure do miss those emotionless guys that I used to get all the time. Where did they go? They were so quick and on top of everything. Hey, still great for takeout! 15-20 mins from call to pickup and you're in and outta there in a flash.

Want to save some dough in this economy? ?Eat at Queen's House. Why? Most items on the menu (if not all) are under $10. The serving sizes are so HUGE you're practically getting two meals for the price of one. The quality of their noodles was a pleasant surprise. ?It wasn't sloppy, soft, or spongy. ?It was pleasantly doughy, gave you something to chew on, very enjoyable. ? The service sucked, sure, but whatever. ?This ain't the Ritz Carlton. ?Suck it up.

Going through the motions...the food is good but not great. First time was a 3star experience, the last two times were a 1 and 0 star, respectively. The service was weak to miserable each of the three times we've been here. I don't think we'll be coming back. It's as if it was a bother for us to be there. One of the three times Queen's was less than half full. I can not recommend this place and doubt that we'll be back.

4 solid stars of scrumptious goodness. Try their: * Beef and Tendon Noodle soup (a solid staple - I see people ordering this a lot) * Scallion cake (so so good!!! crispy edges, chewy middle) * Curry beef over rice (moist, flavorful and very good!) * Sweet and sour spareribs (juicy!) * Mongolian beef (just the right amount of spiciness-mMmmMm!) Meh, you could probably pass on: * Salt and pepper spareribs (too salty) The variety to their menu keeps me coming back for more, though, I do have my favorite menu items!

Oh man, the noodles here are DAMN good. I "surprised" the bf the other day when I headed down to Mountain View to join him for lunch with his work buddy. We decided to try this place since it's right on Castro and judging by the yummy smell coming from it, it should be a good choice. I ordered the beef stew and tendon noodles, and let's just say I did a little happy dance as soon as I've had some. A big steaming bowl of perfectly cooked, "al dente" (insert Chinese translation here) noodles, a rich, artery-blocking broth, and huge tender chunks of perfectly seasoned beef and tendon. It was really, really good! While I'm sure I must've gained 5lbs, got my arteries clogged, and reignited my on-again/off-again relationship with MSG, it was so worth it for the noodles that I got. Hey, NO JUDGING! PS - My review is based solely on their noodles, I dont know about their lunch specials. PPS - Service? Uh, what service? Seriously, you don't go to a noodle place looking for service so I can't say I'm surprised by how we were treated.

Didn't like this Taiwanese place. Been wanting to try this place for a while but was very disappointed. Green onion pancake (2 stars) - these were not panfried enough and barely even brown. Almost like they rushed it out the kitchen. But then a few min later they serve one that's nicely browned to the table 2 down from us. Grrr. And these are thin, wimpy, with little taste. Braised beef noodle soup (3 stars) - soup base was very tasty and they did give a lot of "meat" pieces but 80% of these pieces were mostly fat. And the noodles were super thick, almost like udon. I definitely like my noodles the normal width ones. Sauteed greens with garlic (2.75 stars) - Taiwanese places can rarely mess this up but our greens came rather mushy and the garlic taste was a bit off And one really annoying thing is that the place is small and they seated us at a table for 2 with BARELY 6 inches between the tables to the right and left of us. I felt like we were eating with the strangers next to us on both sides and we could hear everything they said and they could here everything we said. NO PERSONAL SPACE. Bottom line: Sorry Queen House, but Joy in Foster City kicks your a** easily. And if you value your personal space and don't ike eating literally next to a stranger, then this place isn't for you.

Three words: cheap lunch specials. Obviously don't go here for quality because you won't find great Chinese food. ?I've tried the Singapore Rice Noodles and the Black Bean Chicken. ?Both were really bland, but fast and cheap. ?Just make sure you ask for a shaker of white pepper, and go nuts. I guess it's a good place to go if you don't have a lot of time for your lunch break, but let's face it -- you're on Castro! ?There's a whole row of much better restaurants if your stomach rumbles for more than fast food style Chinese.

Ahhh....good soups here. ?Today I had the Beef Stew and Tendon Noodle Soup. ?This comes spicy or non-spicy and is usually the dish I order when coming here. ?Nice thick noodles which goes good with this type of soup. Sometimes there is a long line of people waiting to be seated, but this is usually during peak hours of the Lunch Hour. ?So be there early or be there late....lots of things to look at on Castro Street in Mountain View.

Decent place if you are looking for some budget Chinese food. The food here really aren't great but it's fast and it's cheap. Came here for a Chinese New Year's Eve dinner after waited 45 minutes at Fu Lam Mun and walked all the way to Kirin just to be greeted by yet another crazy line. The Three Cups Chicken has no taste of basil and the complimentary scallion pancakes were just outright ridiculous. (Can you really call those scallion pancakes??) Imperial Spareribs was a bit tough but the Eggplant with Spicy Garlic Sauce and Sauteed Pea Sprouts aren't that bad. Beef Stew Clay Pot was tasty. If you are looking for quality Chinese food this really aren't the right spot. If you are on a tight budget and wanted some fulfilling food this would be your kind of restaurant.

Place is going down hill!! they must have got a new cook.. the help is horrible.. yes it is popular.. but i think the original owners bailed out.. They dont ask you if you want mild or spicy for beef noodle soup.. it was a horrible experience for all in the place.. the person in back of me didnt even get the order they wanted.. i will not go back.. let this be a warning..

I found out about this place because my mom knew one of the cooks there so he told us the beef noodle is one of the most popular dish. ?I prefer the spicier version but still its on the sweeter side although the overall soup taste is pretty good, flavorful and not too greasy. ?It would be perfect if it weren't so sweet. ?The amount of Beef to tendon that they gave was perfect also, however the noodles were your standard non hand made noodles so I am still in search of the perfect noodle place that's less than 15 miles away. I've been there 3 or 4 times since and every time I ordered some dishes but nothing stands out. ?It was your standard home cooking. ? The cook told me that the fried oysters were also very popular. ?It was not bad but in general I am not a fan of fried oysters so I can't be the judge. The place is small and the service was pretty standard. ?Its not a good place to bring your babies. ?I did once bring my baby and his huge stroller and to my surprise they were very accommodating during their busy lunch time.

This place has an impressive amount of dishes available, which is good and bad - as you can imagine, it is sometimes very hit and miss. The portions are generally nice and filling though. Some of it is authentic but some of it isn't. Also, their style of beef noodles has tomatos in it - I know that it is as authentic a recipe as one without, but I definitely prefer it without. So a word of caution. The staff is nice and helpful; if you visit tea era a lot you will see familiar faces - they have the same owner.

We were visiting my brother at the Hyatt on Great America Parkway and ended up getting pretty hungry after we left. My dad made his way to Castro Street and parked so we could find a place to eat. We were in the mood for Chinese, so we stopped in to Queen House. We did the normal non-asian deal: "Are there Asians in here? Yes. Okay, then let's go!". We ordered braised bean curd, shrimp fried rice, combo chow mein, fried won tons, broccoli beef and salt and pepper pork chops. Our food came out SUPER fast and the fried rice was awesome -- lumpy and a little salty and yum. I was pretty happy with my food! Overall, we paid 47.00 plus tip for our meal. We were super full and satisfied. I wouldn't drive all the way to Castro Street to eat here, but I would eat there again if I were looking for a spot that way!

We had the Beef Noodle Soup since it was recommended by yelpers and end up very disappointed!! ?The noodle was too tough, the beef brisket was way too fat and the vegetables that come with the noodle were not even properly cooked.

I've actually been coming here for a number of years but I guess I always forgot to review it. If anything, Queen's house is known for one dish: the minced pork over rice. That dish is straight crack in a bowl. Awesome flavor, a decent amount. Only drawback is that it's expensive as hell for what you get. Aside from that their dishes are pretty decent. Eggplant in a clay pot, pork chops, and the onion pancake are all things that I would come back and order from time to time. Also, they are tied to the boba shop next door, so if Tea Era is your thing, then you can kill two birds with one stone. Only thing that brings this place down is their lack of seating (it literally seats 20 people), and their prices. It shouldn't cost over $40 for 4 people to eat Taiwanese food. Seriously, I could get the same thing for 1/3 the price in SoCal.

Queens house is a small Chinese restaurant on Mountain View's Castro Street. ?It's pretty tiny, though they recently remodeled which has made seating more efficient. ?We found this place when we first moved here and it's hands down our favorite place in MV. What to order- general tsao's chicken is phenomenal, as is the general's tofu if you're a vegetarian. ?Wonton noodle soup is great too. ?We also like the bean sprout dish. ?The honest truth is everything we've ordered here is fantastic. For a treat, order the jasmine milk tea that's made next door. Expect to wait in line on a Friday night and to have to flag down the waiter for things like water, the check or a soup ladle. Enjoy!

Excellent dinner deal for $17.99. We stopped by yesterday after a grueling warm yet enjoyable day at the San Jose Jazz Festival. ?My friend took a step back in time......old stomping grounds when SGI was still roaring. For $17.99, you select three entrees from a list, that includes either steamed rice or scallion cakes. ?We opted for the rice. ? We ordered the Black Bean Chicken, Garlic Sauteed Spinach, and the Salt and Pepper Fish. ?Everything was amazing. ?The Black Bean Chicken was tender, with the kick provided by the salty black bean sauce. ?The spinach was flash fried enough to tenderize the stalks, yet still retained the crunch, accented by cloves of garlic. ?The Salt and Pepper Fish consisted of fried pieces of whitefish, seasoned with salt, pepper, and slices of jalapeno and onions. ?It was my fave dish: savory and tasty. Great place located on the already neat Castro street. ?I'd come here in a flash!

Good hearty place we can rely on to get a decent meal. I like the stir fried rice cakes here and the chive dumplings have always been good. It's a place we fall back on when we don't know what to eat for dinner when wandering around Mountain View. The wait can be awhile and the service can be spotty but its pretty decent Taiwanese food for this side of the ocean. CLOSED ON TUESDAYS!!

1 star to start. Food (0.5 stars): Food can be hit-or-miss here. ?The General Tso's Chicken is usually pretty good, though it can be on the dry side at times. ?I'm not a fan of the Salt and Pepper Fish as it's been rubbery the two times that I've tried it. ?Other dishes of note are the Beef Noodle Soup (not bad!), the Broccoli Beef (just alright), and the Green Onion Pancakes (can be greasy, but generally tasty). Service (0 stars): The service is lousy here. ?You are continually ignored and they tend to forget what you just asked for. ?They are also relatively unfriendly and are very brisk with customers. Value (1 star): I only come here for the $20 special, which lets you choose 3 items and a side (i.e. green onion pancakes or white rice). ?The 3 items must be chosen from a select list which is relatively large and I believe consists of around 40 items. ?You get a lot of food for your money and portions are huge! Experience (0.5 stars): My experience has been neutral overall as it has the feel of your typical Chinese restaurant. ?It is very crowded inside and the wait can be pretty long, but the food isn't bad and you will leave very full, though a bit frustrated by the lack of service. Overall: 1.0 - Baseline 0.5 - Food 0.0 - Service 1.0 - Value 0.5 - Experience ============= 3 stars

we came here in search of authentic Taiwanese food. I thought the value was great, but the taste was just okay. The beef stew and tendon soup was hearty..but it had way too much MSG. The pork chop soup was far less flavorful..and the fried pork shop was really fatty. the tofu and seaweed appetizer didn't taste very fresh. Maybe we didn't order the right things this time...so I'd check them out again.

Pea sprouts: SO CHEWY! Too chewy... Beef Noodle Soup: Broth was just OK... not the best. I expected more from a place where the waiters barely speak English. Not a fan of those thick white noodles - I like the chewy A&J ones way more. Combo over rice: Surprisingly pretty tasty, but in a way that Tung Kee's combo over rice is tasty. In fact, I think based on the quality of the ingredients, I may prefer Tung Kee (seems fresher?). But they really load on the toppings here at Queen's so you might get more bang for your buck. I need to remember not to order pearls in my drink. Queens and Tea Era are connected (by ownership I believe), so you can order Tea Era drinks with your meal. The pearls are extremely sweet, and the tea is almost too sweet even when you ask for "half sugar". Meh, Queen's is alllllrightt and the closest Taiwanese in the vicinity, so I shall return if I'm in the mood for something convenient, but I much prefer Liang's, Southland Taste, and A&J.

I always come here for the Szechuan beef noodle soup. Without fail, it is always hot, savory, filling enough for two servings, and chock full of thick, mealy noodles that are not overly soft, large beef chunks, and plenty of bok choy. And red peppers to boot. I've also had their black bean noodle (jajyungmein in Korean) and that was pretty good too, but the one dish that always stands out to me is the beef noodle soup! Whether in the restaurant or to go, always a hit for those cold nights, or even in the summer when you're just craving some old fashioned beef soup.

The fact that we could order boba drinks while dining here was my favorite part, because I'm a sucker for boba. ?I had the barley milk tea and it was excellent. ?Couldn't really taste the barley that much but I know a good milk tea when I taste it.

Tasty, fast, crowded, cheap. It's a Taiwanese place and most dishes are excellent. If I listed everything I liked there I would be here all night, so I'll name just a few.. string beans, the special rice and pork pot, the sliced cold meat (yum!) and their tea eggs. The service is generally really fast and they'll even bring you drinks from the fantastic pearl tea place next door. The prices are reasonable too. The downside is the crowd this place draws at times. You never have to wait too long, but it's really tiny (maybe 10 tables) and sometimes you find yourself waiting in the small entryway huddling to stay warm on a cold day. If I'm not mistaken they are a cash only place too. Just be prepared for that. Parking can be rough at certain times (dinner time mainly), but there is a parking lot behind the restaurant and street parking in front.

Worth your time, particularly if you're trying to get fed for less than $10. Good food. Cheap food. Get the beef noodle soup. Even if you're not a spicy eater, get it spicy (adds to the experience, i swear!). Yeah, people are right: the service is bad.

One of the biggest reasons I live where I do. If it wasn't for this restaurant I might be living in Santa Clara. My roommate lived in Taiwan and claims this is among the best he's tasted in California. I don't care how Taiwanese it is, it's just darn good and cheap. It's always best to come with 3 or more people, then you can have more food. Beef stew clay pot, general tso's chicken, eggplant in garlic sauce, ayt-zai, sha-lum-bau, tai-se-lu-rho-fan... funny, some of the foods I no longer know the name of in English. The soups, too, are awesome. I'm very sad they no longer serve stinky tofu. It took me 3 years to get to all the other restaurants on Castro because I usually could never pass up Queen House.

I think they have new owners because the tables have been changed & some removed, now there's cushioned seats on the side wall and it just looks different. The menu also is different & more expensive then when I ate here last. We got: Appetizer #12: pork & chinese chives dumplings (12) $5.99 - there is a 15 min wait for them, but they are pretty good. ?Lots of pork, chives, & garlic. ?Make your own sauce though, none given. #124 Szechwan beef noodle soup $5.99 - huge portion. ?Soup is sweet & not spicy. ?Beef is tender, noodles are yucky though. ?Very doughy tasting. Under weekend dim sum got #199 - sesame panroll $1.99 - skip this, it's pretty bad. ?Very doughy, though the very top w/ sesame is ok. ?Don't eat the rest of it though. Someone in the kitchen has anger management issues - he's screaming in Chinese at the waitresses. ?Horrible! Our total before tip was $15.12. ?They take credit cards.

I haven't been here in a loooong time, but it's still the same old Queen's House. Solid Chinese/Taiwanese food for decent prices. The dinner special is always the way to go. 3 dishes and rice (or scallion pancakes) for $22. They've had this special for years and it doesn't appear like the prices or menu have changed at all. I even recognized one of the workers because sometimes I would order take out. Usually you can't go wrong with the following: Salt and pepper spareribs, spicy string beans, cashew chicken, spicy tofu, black pepper beef, etc. They don't have a lot of seating and it's pretty popular, so you may have to wait.

In a small and crowded area on Castro street lies this unassuming restaurant. It's one of those restaurants that make you go like: Queen's House? Interesting name, I wonder what they serve - but I probably won't stop in. Knowing better however, Queen's house is mainly known for their Niu Ro Mien (Beef noodle soup). I made the venture here on this past weekend. Sad they did not have fan tuan during dinner - what's with me ordering chinese breakfast food at dinner? The onion pancakes were decent here on this visit. Well seasoned, and not overly oily. Pot stickers were also very flavorful and well grilled (bottom grilled and browned, top soft and chewy) The dan dan mien was mediocre. Not too much ground meat, too much water chestnut, and a TON of hot oil or sesame oil. I would move my noodles to the side, and see half of the bowl filled with sesame oil. A little gross, and I didn't finish it. Noodles are interesting. They are pretty thick, but chewy and have good texture. They also have good flavor, and aren't bland or doughy tasting. Though, they will fill you up quick, just for the sake of the size. 3 stars - generally mediocre food, though cheap. Good to bring maybe 2 or 3 friends and order family style, but try not to bring more than 6, due to seating.

Why does this place have 3.5 stars? ?I feel deceived. ?This place was really greasy, and pretty bland. ?And I usually like my food greasy. True, the Beef Noodle Soup that we got tasted better a couple days later but.........I don't know if that's normal. ?Or good. ?Is it good when your food tastes better because it's festered a bit in your fridge? ?I dunno. I also got the Tan-Tan Mein, which didn't taste like what it was supposed to taste like at all. ?Or at least it was unlike any other Tan-Tan Mein I've ever had at any other Chinese restaurant. ?Tasted really uncomplex--like they took a Lee Kum Kee sauce packet from Ranch 99, heated it up, and threw in some ground meat with it. ?Which is basically what I do at home some days, expect I pay under $3 for that. The Scallion Cake, in my opinion, was beyond oily and I had to add my own salt in order for it to have any flavor. ?I could barely taste the scallions and the pancake itself wasn't layered/flaky like it's supposed to be. ?Honestly, probably one of the worst scallion cakes I've had.

Came here for an early dinner when the employees were eating. We were greeted and sat. We were brought menus and water was brought without asking. We started off with an order of spicy wontons (hong you cha shou) as an appetizer. This was made different than I've ever had it. This one used peanut sauce, but I usually get it with only some soy sauce and spicy oil. I didn't like the different serving style and the wontons were humungous! I wasn't too fond of their wontons, not only were they larger than wontons are supposed to be, but the meat wasn't all that great. My boyfriend had the spicy beef noodle soup, which was pretty spicy (since I asked for it very spicy) and pretty tasty! The meat was cooked thoroughly and was tender. The soup was flavorful and good. I had minced pork over rice, which was good but nothing spectacular. I had way too much rice for the amount of meat. Overall, the portion sizes were great. We had a lot of food for what we ordered. This place is a bit expensive, especially when I'm used to SoCal prices. The service was pretty good. They were nice and food came out quickly (I would hope so since we were the only ones in there).

The funny thing is..I walked by this place so many times strolling down Castro but never thought about trying it out until I read the Yelper's reviews about their Spring Onion Pancakes and dumplings so we decided to try it. ? My honest opinion is that it's only average compared to what I've tried in the past for this category of cuisine. ?Because aren't' Spring Onion pancakes suppose to have actual Spring Onions? ?As for the shrimp pork veggie dumplings on the other hand, well they were better-than-average and they were definitely homemade, good in portion size but lacked soupy kick in the first bite which you find in a truly good dumplings. ?The Spicy Beef Noodle soup, was good in flavor but they used the wrong beef (they used fatty brisket instead of the round cut piece with the tendons marbled) that is in the traditional Taiwanese Beef Noodle.

A small-ish place on Castro that provides quick service and a great bang for your buck. ?I thought i'd let you in on the awesomeness which is their beef noodle soup (BNS), but if you've read any reviews at all then you are already aware of this. ?A hearty amount of beef (im a meat eater) with lots of noodles. ?Always a battle between pain and gluttony; be careful not to scald your tongue! While there isn't a lot of seating, efficient service results in short waits. Biggest complaint : you have to specifically ask for ice water (a BNS essential), it comes in a medium-small glass and they don't automatically refill (this is not atypical for asian restaurants).

Good and cheap! The beef noodle soups are definitely the most well known dishes here. The soup is hot, and the flavor comes close to how it is in Taiwan. But I really enjoy their other dishes since they are light and flavorful. The standard leafy greens with garlic are not weighed down by a lot of oil like most other Chinese places. The ?(3 cups chicken) is excellent.

Been here a ton of times because the food is decent and pretty cheap. ?It's even on Castro so it's always bustling. ?The location is pretty small but it was renovated about a year+ ago. ?Next door you will find Tea Era (owned by Queen's House), by far the best boba place in the peninsula - better than the chains - Verde and TapEx. Their beef noodle soup is really popular, but I have to say that I don't like it at all. ?It's really oily. ?The meat is cheap and the style is Szechuan rather than Taiwanese. Their zhua bing is pretty good though it's served cold a lot of times. The lu rou fan (minced pork rice) is really good and it's pretty cheap/filling.

It is the weekend, and there is a sudden urge for Taiwanese breakfast... Then this place can fill the VOID. Pretty decent. It has the flavor but not all that OOOMpH in the dishes and noodle orders. I had the spicy beef noodle soup. The meat was excellent but the broth is not that good; it was oily to a point where all you can taste was hot oil flavor. The noodles are the chewy thicker kinds. Good try, but not all there The oyster pancake of ours was little to be too excited about. The oysters did not seem fresh. There was a overly bitter taste of un-fresh oysters, and the sauce was just enough spice or tang to it. If you are in the area, and feining for TW food then this place has all the taste to excite those taste buds... but not the best.

If this is the best Taiwanese food in Mountain View, then I feel bad for the residents of Mountain View. ?First off, the service. Bad bad and what's worse than bad? ?We went on a Sunday morning just before the place got packed. ?We got seated within about 2 minutes. Great. ?Then we sat around for another 10 before we got A menu after we had asked for it. A menu? Yes, one single menu. ?We had to ask a separate waitress for a second menu. ?We ordered uneventfully (fortunately for us) and also got a bubble tea from next door. ?Here what we ordered: * Sweet Soy Milk * Chinese Donut * Pig Intestine Noodle Soup * Chicken Roll The milk was pretty good. ?A bit small, but it was done well. ?The donut looked like it sat in the frier for about 35 minutes. ?It was ridiculously soggy with oil and yet completely hardened. ?The noodle soup was bland. ?It tasted like water + noodle + intestines. ?And there weren't even that much intestines! The chicken roll was probably the saving grace. ?That was reasonably fresh and tastey. Ok, so back to the service. ?All the food came out pretty much immediately after ordering -- except for the milk. ?The donut goes with the milk. It's like coffee and cream. Can't really have the cream by itself. ?It really need the coffee. ?We sat around for about 10 minutes before we asked for it, and about 5 minutes later we got it. ?Oh, and then there's some yelling and screaming in the kitchen. ?At the end of the lunch, we asked for our check. ?10 minutes later, we had to ask for it again. ?And about another 10 minutes later, we got it. Anything we asked for, a spoon, water, etc. took at least two requests and typically with unhappy faces. So for a typical "quick" chinese breakfast which takes about 30-40 minutes, it took us well over an hour. ? At the end, we got crappy food and crappier service. ?If I lived in MV, I'll make the drive to Cupertino.

Queen House deserves 3.5 star. Reliable and solid. ?I've yet to be disappointed here. ?Granted, I always get the same thing (spicy beef and tendon noodle soup). They give you lots of meat and the service is great. ?On a hot day for lunch, we (a party of 5) didnt want to wait so we asked to sit outside. ?Our waitress kept telling me that we might get sunburned cuz it's so hot. ?She said she'd keep an eye out for the next available table. ?Lo and behold, we were called to go inside and all of our food was ready to go at the table inside. Minus 1.5 stars for the small space/long wait and dirty chinese decor/feel to the place (but you know that means it's authentic!)

Came here for dinner this time. The extra star mainly comes from the sauteed pea sprouts with garlic I smelled at another table. That smell reminded me of home. I was pretty mixed with the rest of the dishes, including a disgusting oversight in clean food preparation. From what I have tried on Castro St., this place has the best value. This time, we had: Pork dumplings - Much better than last time, juicy and delicious. Kung pao Chicken - Nothing too special Kung pao Shrimp - ? Better, had more vegetables in it Popcorn chicken - Excellent, chicken was mostly meat, not fat Spicy Cold Noodle - Looked like something you could make at home, but the flavor was there. Good amount of spicy. Chinese Broccoli - Friend found a cooked green caterpillar stuck to one of the leaves. It's more common than you think. So common I didn't even decide to complain. I've cleaned chinese broccoli before and it's hard to see their camouflaged bodies. Service wasn't bad for a packed house. You just need the gall the raise your hand and call them.

The food was good, but if you're a vegetarian or you have food allergies, you may want to look elsewhere. They LIE! More on that later... Everything we ordered was delish. The beef noodle soup had very tender, flavorful meat and the noodles that accompanied it were great as well. The broth might've been just a tad bit oily, though. The pork + cabbage dumplings were very good - I can't tell the difference between good dumplings and great dumplings, but the thick skin and the flavorful insides indicated that these probably fell on the "great" end of the spectrum. The pork blood + intestines soup was a bit on the adventurous side for me, but I'm sure it was good if you like that kind of stuff. Sweet and sour fish was great, as was some dish that reminded me of an empanada stuffed with vermicelli, ginger, and scallions. So why am I only giving it 3-stars? We had one vegetarian in our group. She ordered a few dishes and made sure to ask if one of them contained shrimp, to which the watiress replied, "No." She also asked for some tofu dish to be made as a vegetarian dish. So what happened? There was shrimp in that first dish, and the second tofu dish had some meat on it. Imagine if she had been allergic to shrimp, it could have been a horrible outcome!

This place is completely unpretentious. ?It's also definitely a Chinese food establishment. ?Ok, well duh, it serves Chinese food. ?But if you didn't know that, you'd be able to tell immediately upon walking in and discovering how closely spaced together the tables are. ?I think that when all the seating is filled, there is honestly no way of getting up without making the table next to you shift over to make room. ? Anyway, the food is pretty good bang for buck, but nothing too exciting. ?I've been here before for their group special. ?I think it's something like 3 dishes plus a starch (think fried rice or pancake) for around $25. ?It's a pretty good deal. ?Also, they have a pretty decent lunch special that comes with soup, salad, rice (white or fried) and a main dish for around $9. ?Last time I went, I got the beef noodle soup because Queen's House is known for its hand-pulled noodles. ?The soup was a a bit on the sweet side, though the beef was quite tender. ?They also threw in a handful of spinach. ?The noodles were a bit of a let down though, as I expected them to have a bit more "bite" to them. ? If I were in the mood for some REALLY cheap Chinese food, I would consider going to Queen's House again. ?However, I'm more partial to the beef noodle soup at Chef Liu down the street.

Greasy, salty, and probably rife with MSG, but delicious. The green onion pancake must be a Taiwanese interpretation of the northern style green onion pancake, 'cause it's certainly not like what I had in Beijing. ?It's fluffier, larger, and quite greasy but good in its own way.

This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Mountain View -- a good variety of dishes (in Taiwanese style), affordable prices, and very fast service. ?It's certainly not an ostentatious or luxurious interior, and a little crowded/cramped at peak times, but clean and comfortable.

I love this little place for solid food at really cheap prices. 3 dishes for 19.99 can't be beat in the area. We had mongolian beef, pot stickers, garlic eggplant and chicken with green beans... we were really hungry. Normally for 2 people just 3 dishes would have been more then enough. The service is prompt and the food generally comes fast... randomly but fast; our potstickers came last.

My Yelp friend Randy does a good enough review of this restaurant, that I don't feel I have to go in depth describing everything. ?I'll just give you guys the cliff notes version: Food: Solid, Authentic Chinese Junk Food is a good way of describing the food here. It's definitely somewhere you come when you're craving a hot bowl of noodle soup and the (northern style?) scallion pancakes. ?Get the scallion pancakes that are broken up into round strips - trust me they're BETTER. I also recommend the spicy shrimp and beef noodle soup. This reminds of the Chinese-Korean dish, Jampong. The broth on this soup is insane! Other than a couple of GREAT dishes, the food is average. Ambiance: It's a whole in the hole-in-the-wall that gets PACKED during lunch - come early! Service: Um.. it's a chinese restaurant, what do you expect. Price: EL - CHEAPO. Perfect for starving students who love carbs and greasy food. Bottom line, this place serves some good and average food. It's a place to go to when you're too lazy to travel to Foster City and eat at Joy's. ?It's no where near as good as Joy's, but it's definitely a good replacement.

I've come to Queen House so often that I thought I'd written a review yet. ?Generally speaking, their food is good. ?I like to come for the dinner special where you get to order three dishes for a bit over twenty bucks. ?However, what persuaded me to actually sit down and write a review on Yelp is discovering a below average dish on their menu - their spicy beef noodle soup. ?Oh man, this is not the place to order this dish, unless you just want to have the meat. ?Queen House gives you lots of big, tender chunks of meat. ?Their noodles, however, are sub-par. ?They just don't taste very fresh. ?The soup is way too salty and oily. ?And where's my bok choy? ?Looks like they decided to deviate and give me spinach instead. ?Oy. ? What added insult to injury is that when I asked for some pickled vegetables to go with the noodles, they actually charged me $1 for maybe an ounce of the stuff. ?At A&J's, they give me as much as I want! ?AND, usually, at A&J's I don't really need the pickled vegetables to add flavor to my spicy beef noodle soup, but here, I needed every piece of it since the soup was so one-dimensional. ?Jeebus. ?It's not even spicy!!

1.5 Stars Decided to give this place a go after reading some of the great reviews this place had... Unfortunately, it was nothing but a bad dinner (on Friday night!!) We ordered the spicy beef noodle, spring onion pancake, shrimp dumplings... none were good.. it was very average, nothing special at all. The service wasn't great either, given that the waitress decided to slam the bowl on the table (thank god the soup didn't splash on either of us) . The dumplings were really dry...

Delicious Taiwanese food, although I'm still tasting it hours later. ?:) I live in Mountain View but just got around to trying Queen's House for lunch today. ?I went with my fellow pig-out partner, P, and we ordered 4 dishes -- that's right, for 2 people. ?(I always justify this gluttonous behavior by saying that I don't know when I'll be back next, so I'd best try a number of items). Authentic and extremely tasty. ?I tried the Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup, with great broth, not-too-fatty beef and fresh, homemade noodles. ?The Taiwanese Style Chopped Poker over Rice was also very good -- but also very fatty. ?The on choy (sauteed pea sprout with garlic) were our one health selection. ?And final dish was the scallion cake, which the menu styles as "Chinese Pizza."

Love this place! The beef stew noodle soup is their signature dish. If you like spicy version of it, try the sichuan beef noodle soup. It's got the most tender beef ever, and it's marinated so it's sweet. Large portions, lots of meat, really hearty. Service can be a little slow at times, but who can beat the $6 noodles!

My husband and I loved Queen House, and he always speaks of it fondly of it even though we rarely make it to Mountain View. ?So the other day, we went there to pick up take out to have dinner with friends. ?And I was so disappointed. ?The food was very oily and overly spicy. ?It is was if they made it extra spicy to hide the fact the food was not well cooked. ? I am not sure if this place as gone downhill, but I ate there at least 2 dozen times when I worked nearby and always enjoyed it. ?We had the stir fried green beans (okay), deep fried chinese rolls (so hard you could throw it through a brick wall), chinese beef noodles (very oily and noodles were not that fresh), and scallion pancakes (too oily and overcooked so that it was like a board). ? Maybe their takeout service is bad, but our next time in Mountain View, we went to Cafe Yulong for take out and the food was clearly better.

I'm shocked at some of the reviews. There used to be a better chinese noodle place on Castro Street, but it's long since gone out of business and Queen's House is definitely THE place for hand-pulled noodles in the area. A hint to people: Stop ordering kung pao chicken and eggplant and all those generic dishes that non-chinese always seem to like ordering at cheap restaurants. You go to Queen's House for two things: 1. Their soup noodles 2. Their fried green-onion pancakes Everytime I go with my family to Queen's house we generally get 2 soup noodle dishes (My favorite is the beef w/ tendon noodles) and the fried pancakes. And if you don't know what the pancakes are, they are basically a flat salty fried dough. None of the other Chinese places in the south bay make it better than Queen's House does. My grandma has been cooking quality chinese food for longer than I've been alive and she loves the noodles here. If that's not convincing than I don't know what is. This is the best noodle shop that i've been able to find in the south bay. Forget ramen and go here instead.

(They normally wouldn't let you use the restroom, and made you use the Milk Tea place next door, since it's the same owner), however, since next door isn't opened at 11, I had the honor of walking into the kitchen, which was on the way to the restroom and it SCARED THE CRAP OUT OF ME! Since I was starved, and nothing else opens at 11, judging from what I saw I ordered the safest choices: Kung-Pao Chicken and Green Onion Beef. Boy! Was I surprised!

Don't get me wrong - this place has very decent food for the price, and they are very fast at serving food. You can't go wrong with the lunch specials, especially. Quality Kung Pao chicken over rice with soup for $7 is great. I gave Queen House 3 stars for their really crappy service. Fast food service is definitely a plus, but they are rude and often very confrontational about things. For example. my coworker and I went to lunch there to talk about business, but I had already eaten, so I sat across from her while she ate. At one point, she offered me a little piece of zucchini which I accepted, and not 3 seconds later, one of the employees rushes over and tells us that we must pay $5 for a "sitting fee" if I eat her food. If I were chowing down with her, that would be one thing, but I seriously had one bite. ?I still go there, since it's a cheap good Chinese meal, but I often experience the same kind of customer service.

Although the prices seem to have increased recently, this is still a favorite of mine. ? The food has always been delicious. ?Went here for dinner the other night with my mom and we had the Family Style Tofu (I gobbled down so much of this stuff! ?Mmm mmm mmm). ?It has just the right amount of spice, the sauce is so tasty, and the straw mushrooms and veggies that are included in this dish are so good. ?We also had the Twice-Cooked Pork. ?Again, great sauce and cabbage. ?The pork was tasty but kind of fatty. ? Service is blunt but efficient. ?I was bothered when the waitress who seated us coughed into our menus, but since I love the food so much here, I let it slide. ?They brought us plenty of hot white rice (and a refill too) and had hot tea on the table right from the start.

I had the spicy beef noodle soup here -- it was good; the noodles were nice and thick, and the pieces of beef were big and in a generous portion. I would say, though, that the broth didn't really meet my expectations. It lacked that great beefy taste that a from-scratch, simmering-for-5+ hours broth should have. I like that this place is owned by the same people who own the bubble tea place next door. The milk tea bubble tea that I had was good in that the bubbles were firm and chewy, but the milk tea itself tasted different -- not necessarily bad, but not what I'm used to. For the price, this place is a pretty darn good lunch spot in Mountain View. If I come here again, I will make sure to try another one of their popular noodle dishes and get a different flavored bubble tea.

Besides the really long wait... you can tell this will be a great place just by looking inside and seeing all the Chinese families! I've been coming here ever since Ive been in California. They have the best weekend breakfast.. with the soymilk and the long donuts (i dont remember what they're called anymores). They also have a great deal on chinese food. it's 3 dishes for 17 bucks.

If you want great noodles, there are a few choices on Castro, and Queen's House is on my short list. The broth they cook the noodles in is simply to die for, and the noodles are topped with a generous heap of whatever meat you chose. The servings are large. I was here multiple times for lunch and a couple times for dinner. It's always packed, and rightfully so. Last time, my friend and I shared some potstickers for an appetizer and I had a beef noodle soup for a main course. Yummy like you won't believe.

We ordered the scallion pancakes (pretty good, slightly too oily..), pea sprouts sauteed with garlic (very authentic - just like what my grandmother would make), fried rice (typical, bleh), and some shrimp dish (not so great, kinda half-assed asian).

Each dish comes with a bowl of suanlatang (Spicy sour soup) and a small plate of salad. When the dish arrives, it also comes with a bigass bowl of rice. So the Suanlatang was definitely sour and spicy. But something was definitely wrong. IT WAS SALTY AS HELL. I swear this bowl of soup was brewed in a salt mine. Or the inside of the pot was lined with salt like the lip of a margarita glass. When the dishes came out, ALL OF THEM WERE SUPER SALTY. Beef, chicken, and a string bean dish all had a heavy salty accent. If the dishes could talk, they would all have a heavy Russian accent.....no idea, just what I imagine when I say "salty accent." Soooooooo here's a Top Gear Top Tip (wait what??): DON'T ORDER FROM THE LUNCH SPECIAL MENU. Order from the rest of the menu but STAY AWAY FROM THE LUNCH SPECIALS. BLEH.

My husband *loves* this place and comes here for the szechuan beef noodle soup. ?And I love to watch him eat it-- his eyes water, his nose runs, and his forehead pops beads of sweat....... very entertaining! The portions are huge and you could easily split a bowl of noodle soup for lunch and be perfectly satisfied. ?A screaming deal for $5.99!

niu rou mien!!! My girlfriend introduced me to Queen's House and I've been hooked on niu rou mien ever since. ?It's great on a cold day and cures any hangovers. Interestingly, when I went to Taiwan, the beef noodle soups there are nothing like the ones at Queen House... authentic much? Price is good for a big bowl of noodle soup. ?We've also gotten several other Taiwanese dishes because my girl's eyes are bigger than her stomach. Service is okay here, they cater to Chinese people but they're nice to non-Mandarin speakers too. ?You have to ask them to re-fill your water.

A friend brought me to this place for lunch as he was telling me that he loved this Sichuan restaurant. When I arrived, I realized it is actually a Taiwanese restaurant which delighted me more as I was looking for Taiwanese noodle place near Palo Alto. As compares to the Southern Taiwan Delight restaurant in Cupertino, this place serve more spicy stuffs. Their spicy beef noodle is great but not spicy enough. Overall most of their noodle are good and cheap. Due to small seating capacity, might have to wait most of the time.

Solid place for some good Taiwanese food. I ordered the szechuan noodle soup and it was great. The service was ok, took them a while to bring us our check but the rate that the food came out was fast. I'll be back to try their tan-tan noodles and onion pancake. Go early as the place is tiny and gets packed pretty fast.

I was told they had good Taiwanese breakfast. ?So we went. ?But, I was not impressed. ? You'd think that since Taiwanese breakfast was only served on weekends and the place was crowded it'd be fresh and great. ?But, it turned out that the Chinese donut was so oily we couldn't eat even half of it. ?It was so the opposite of fresh. ?How can you have bad Chinese donut? ? It's one of the main reasons for Taiwanese breakfast! ? I suppose I will give them another chance one day and try their other dishes, but never again for breakfast... Gotta go to Chef Woo's in Cupertino for that.

3.5 stars, but I had to round it down. Pluses: CHEAP, authentic Chinese goodness. Minuses: Small and crowded. So I finally came here after several friends recommended that I come. Ordered the Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup, and I think they gave me the Beef Tendon Noodle Soup. I don't like tendon that much because it's a little too chewy for my taste. Same with the noodles. But the soup was greasy and GOOD. Yummy. I'll have to do some more comparisons in Taiwan and see what other beef noodle soups taste like. Oh, and the scallion pancakes were pretty good.

I am pleansantly surprised by how much better my experience was than 10 years ago. for starters, this time we ordered the special green onion pancake (shanghai style?) rather than the regular one. the regular one was uneventful and not worth consuming. ?we also had the spicy seafood soup. YUM! i also really enjoyed the xiao lung bao (not the best, do good enough to have a few). ?my friend also ordered a tangy vegetable dish which i didn't care for. there's hope after all for a good availability shanghai/itaiwanese dishes after all. i'd definitely bring my hubby back on a weekend to get the full breakfast experience :)

I've been here a few times and in the past, I always left satisfied. Their portions used to be pretty big, and their 3 dishes for $20 deal was awesome. But sadly, the past two visits, our portions seemed rather small and insignificant. We ordered chicken with mixed vegetables and got a plate of veggies with a very small amount of chicken. Everything was soaked in a lot of sauce too, which wasn't like our experience before. I do enjoy their War Wonton Soup though. It had a good amount of wontons and veggies. I'm going to give this place another shot and update my review later on.

By far one of the better Chinese food places, I love Queen's house! They have great food and great traditional Chinese dishes as well. I usually can't find some of these traditional mandarin dishes that I have found here at Queen's house. Their potions are huge and their noodle soups are delicious! The only draw back is that the place is VERY small and it does get very packed for dinner so the wait sometimes is a good 15-30 min. They do serve dim sum and "Chinese breakfast" on weekends before 3:00 PM which is very notable since I love their Chinese donut and soy bean milk!

I came here with my family because my mom read somewhere that it had the best spicy beef noodles in the entire Bay Area. The spicy beef noodles were pretty good, but they came in such a giant bowl that I could only finish a third of the bowl. We also ordered Hong Kong style noodles, which were crunchy with stir-fried ingredients on top. Their green onion pancake was also pretty good. I would go back to try some of their other dishes.

Simple little Taiwanese/Chinese place. Beef tendon noodle soup and beef chow fun... both were pretty decent. The former actually was quite good, the latter was good, but a notch down. Got away for under $20 including tip, too, so I can't complain at all. And it is possible my taste for beef chow fun has gotten a little less stringent after all the horrible ones I've had in my normal stomping grounds. =/

Cafe Yulong is better. ?Go there. Beef noodles - good I guess. scallion pancakes - hella hella greasy, but crispy. tofu and veggies - hella hella greasy, but good flavor. some rice dish - ok. no brown rice either. if I came back I would try their cold noodles with sesame paste, and their zajiang mien.

One of the better Chinese/Taiwanese joints in Downtown Mountain View. This place has a workman like atmosphere, i.e. enjoy your food and leave so don't expect to lounge around too long. Regardless and more important, the food taste fresh and service is quick. First up, salt and pepper fish - little morsels of deep fried fish with salt and pepper sprinkled. Fish was moist and crisp with just a hint of pepper. Chew the jalapenos if you need more heat. Brilliant. Next up, stir fried pea sprouts with garlic. Nicely done as the veges were crisp and deftly flavored. Lastly, stewed beef that has a gravy with oh-so beefy flavor. Yes, they must've slaved hours to get this much flavor and tenderness to the beef. My only gripe is the there were too many chunks of tendon instead of meat. Value-wise, a good deal since we chose the special that comes with 3 dishes and rice for a not-wallet-damaging $23. Ordering individual dishes would probably run $30+.

Ordering pai gu fan (fried pork chop over rice) here is like flipping a coin: either it's tasty or terrible. ?There's no in-between. Sometimes, the pork chop comes out crisply fried and hot, just the way you'd want it. ?Sometimes, it comes out soggy -- so soggy that the fried coating just slides off like paste. Sometimes, the ground pork topping the rice is fatty and scrumptious. ?Sometimes, it tastes like lamb gone bad. Even the veggies that come on the side. ?Sometimes, the 2 stalks of broccoli they give are well-steamed. ?Sometimes, it's as if they bathed the broccoli in salt. So, gamble away. ?Seems like it's the same story with their other dishes here. ?I've had a great bowl of beef noodle soup, but a couple "meh" ones. ?And it'd all be more tolerable if everything cost $1 or $2 less. But when it's good, it's good.

There's a line for a reason. Good food at even better prices! We got the taiwanese style pork over rice which was incredible. The pork was tender and the sourness of the pickles really complimented it well. We also had the spicy beef noodle soup, one of the things this place is really known for. The noodles are clearly hand made which really makes a big difference in terms of texture and consistency. The pork sandwich thing (shao bing jia zhou) wasn't the best i've had. It was a tad dry. The green onion box (their name) doesn't taste as good as some of the other ones I've had as well. Queen's House does so much so well that it's hard to complain about the things they could do better.

Came here again for an early weekend lunch while my sister was staying with me. 4/5 stars for the stewed pork rice (lu rou fan), but 1 star for the salty soy milk (xian dou jiang)! Extremely watery and flavorless. So disappointing :( This place has been kind of hit-or-miss the last few times I've been here, but I'm still a fan, especially because it's so close. The stewed pork rice is delicious and their noodles are filling and hit the spot. The salt + pepper fish, which everyone raves about, was less than impressive though, so I'm not sure if I got it on a bad day or what.

This place is cheap in multiple senses of the word. ?First, it is inexpensive. ?But, the food is also not very good. ?Every time I come here, I am shocked by the amount of oil in the food. ?I think the highlight of the menu is the beef noodle soup. ?The noodles are good and handmade. ?But, I have had better. ?Also, the broth is very oily. ?The rest of the dishes are just too oily for me to comment. ?If they used less oil, I think this would be a fairly good restaurant. The other problem I have with this place is that the tables are sticky. ?As is the case with many average quality Chinese restaurants, the tables are perpetually sticky and the floor is dirty. ?I really appreciate hygiene and QH does not emphasize it. On a more positive note, the service is fast. ?The food is not too salty and not under-seasoned. ?But, I just do not enjoy eating here. ?With all the other Chinese restaurants in the area, I do not see the point of going here.

Finally got a chance to eat at Queen's House last night. Overall, I really liked my meal. The egg rolls were probably some of the best I've ever had. I ordered the shrimp noodle soup, which was also pretty good. I would probably order soup again, but maybe go for the beef noodle soup instead. They give you soo much food, make sure to come hungry! I wish I had room in my stomach for more food, because I would have liked to try the pancakes, too! Next time! I should also warn potential future customers: this isn't your typical chinese-american restaurant, so you're probably not going to want order the beef and broccoli. Try the soup, the pancakes, and anything else that looks interesting! :)

After working out of the Dojo for much of the afternoon, my hungry pals and I head downtown for some dinner before heading back to work. ?We knew we wanted Chinese, but unsure of where to go, we walked up and down a bit and settled on Queens, a place owned by the same folks as Tea Era right next door. We ordered 4 dishes off the family menu deal including Mongolian beef, sweet & sour chicken, green beans, and fish in black bean sauce. ?The food was generally ok, but there wasn't anything that blew my mind. ?Service wasn't great and never dropped in to check on us. I don't know what's up with Chinese food in Mountain View but it's definitely not mind-blowing. ?I guess it's just not a foodie town. ?Boo. Food: 6/10 Service: 5/10 Price: $$ Atmosphere: 6/10

We came here on a whim because another restaurant was closed. I got the beef noodle soup which was very good. The meat is very tender and the soup has a lot of flavor. I wouldn't really stray from this because the other food we have was very bland. The restaurant was very small and seemed kind of rundown. You' are so cramped sitting there and so close to the other table that you can listen perfectly to their conversation. A good thing about this restaurant is that they also own a tapioca place next door and it is prety good. It is super cheap so that might make up for it. You should definitely go and try it!

OVERALL: 3.4 FOOD: 3.5 SERVICE: 3 AMBIANCE: 3 VALUE: 4 First place I ate in the Bay Area, and coming from WhiteBreadMeatAndPotatoes Middle America, was pretty hooked on the dumplings from the get-go. ?Decent variety to choose from, fast, LOTS of food for the price. ?Since that first experience 5+ yrs ago, the place has been remodeled (still very cramped, purely functional, next to no d¨¦cor), and I still go there when I'm craving large amounts of hot, homestyle food, though far less often. New fave is their noodle soups...they use fresh noodles, as opposed to the typical dry-then-cook kind...HUGE plus. ?Menu descriptions aren't entirely intuitive unless you're already familiar with dishes (i.e., 6 different versions of Beef Noodle Soup) so don't be shy about asking. ?They may not be the friendliest, but you'll still get answers. All in all, reliable choice for Taiwanese style staples--you won't leave hungry! ?Better yet, order take-out to skip the shaky service and eat from the comfort of home!

Great for when I crave affordable, quick Chinese food. ? It's about $7/dish for dinner. ?They have a few on a selective menu where it's 3 dishes for $22 + rice or scallion cakes. ?I usually order: - "san bei ji"/3 cups chicken: small pieces of boned chicken cooked in a delicious brown sauce + basil - "yu xiang rou si" / pork slices with bamboo and hot/sour sauce: I crave this sometimes - "yu xiang qie zi" / eggplant with spicy garlic sauce: ?ok I've only ordered this once and probably won't order it again. ?the eggplant slices are huge and the sauce is a little too viscose for me (too much cornstarch). ?mind you this dish in general has a lot of sugar in it These 2 aren't on that "special" menu but good: - "niu rou mien" / beef noodle soup: not bad - "jia jia mien"/brown sauce noodles: ?YUM! ?this was my favorite dish here and I'd come here just to have this. ?The noodles are nice and thick. All's good- just leaves you feelng a little greasy afterwards so I'd recommend ordering a vegetable dish or two to balance things out. ?The sprouts (?) cooked simply in garlic are good. Decor: ?real simple though clean. ?They renovated a year or two back so it's brighter and there's more space with the booths now. ?It's still a bit "hole in the wall"-like but great joint for a casual dinner with friends.

The food is delicious though not spectacular, but made more attractive by their modest pricing and large servings. ?The 3-dishes-20-dollars-plus-rice is a great deal. ?The fried-then-stirfried General Tso's Chicken greatly appeals to my partner's American palate, while the "Three-Cup Tofu" is authentic enough to remind me of my Taiwanese hometown. ?If you live nearby and have not checked this place out, you are missing out!

Beef stew noodle soup, hands down wins my vote for the best beef soup noodle house in the Bay. ?No wonder why there's an extra long wait every time I passed by. ? Their beef stew meat is absolutely tender and the broth is just right that tickles your savory taste buds. ?If you're a true noodle purist, this is definitely one place you have to make a stop at. ?Also, credit cards have a minimum charge of $10 and no AMEX allowed. ?This place is definitely a local Taiwanese place to get their beef noodle fixings.

Oh, Yelp. You've been pretty trusty. You and I have bonded over many a work hour. You were my source and inspiration for my Google spreadsheet of Asian restaurants around the bay. But did you raise my expectations too high? Don't get me wrong. This place was decent. Just not chock full of the fobby tasty goodness that my tummy was looking forward to. Maybe we didn't order right? Headed over for a Sunday lunch. Patiently waited out the line with five of us, and finally crammed around three tables bunched together. And waited for the feasting to begin. Started with the pickled cabbage and pork belly soup. You know, it's an appetite stimulant. As if we didn't eat enough, we wanted to get our appetites going. Love gorging ourselves. The way we roll, we gotta be _stuffed_ by meal's end. The plates started piling up on the table: shao bing you tiao (sesame bread + Chinese donut stick), sweet soymilk (dou jiang), salt + pepper shrimp, niu rou mien (beef noodle soup), drunken chicken (jiu ji), green onion pancake, and Taiwanese-style mi fen (thin noodles). Everything was solid, but nothing was stellar. The main dishes that stood out were the salt+pepper shrimp and the drunken chicken. Yums. But the rest... was just fine. The beef noodle soup had a tasty broth, but it was on par to what we could get at Jersey. Apparently, my mom was a fan of the shao bing you tiao, but that's a pretty typical dish for most Chinese brunches and hard to mess up. The green onion pancake was fine--but didn't have a lot of taste and I needed to dip it in a bit of soy sauce. Oh yeah, and service was hilarious. They set down a credit card on our table even though we hadn't even paid yet. And they kept on sending the wrong dishes to the wrong tables. But it seemed to be family-run, so we just laughed it off. If I come back, I'll try some more of the homestyle Taiwanese dishes for dinner. For now, though, just a decent eatery for cheap eats. For my true Taiwan cravings, though, I'm heading back to Southland Taste in Cupertino.

(12/10/07) - This place is definitely a 4-star restaurant. ?I think the averaged 3.5 is an underrating, so I have to place my 2 cents to try and tip the scale. This place is cheap, and the food is great! My friend and I had plenty food to fill up 3 hungry silicon valley engineers (but there was only 2 of use so we had plenty of left overs). ?and all off this for ~$21 after tax! We had the scallion onion pancakes, hot 'n sour soup, salt and pepper fish and fried rice. ?There is so much more I need to try there, I kept looking over at neighboring tables in envy (though the food we had was great). Need to try those dumpings next time. Our fried rice came out slow, but I won't hold it against them. --- (2/22/08) - Sorry Queen's house I have to take back a star. I was really looking forward to coming back to Queen's house again to try some of the dumplings and other dishes that I saw the last visit. Dumplings... ehh. ?definitely had better, but I have high expectations because I've tasted the holy grail of dumplings @ Joe's Shanghai in NYC (I know they are different styles of dumplings, different cultures for that matter... but i like what I like). The food just flat out wasn't as good as it was the first time. ?Not bad... but not great. ?It's only saving grace was the price. ?This place is a hell of a bang for the buck... I still stand by that. But the number 1 reason I'm taking back a star, is the wait... I was there for a weekday lunch with a few friends, and my buddy, left his name and number of folks on a list, as the hostess instructed him... we later found out after being suspicious of others being sat before us, that they weren't even using the friggin' list! ?we must have waiting 20 minutes longer than we needed to, and 20 minutes is important when you are on a lunch break from work.

Every time I'm working at my friend's on the weekend, I'll order from this place. I always order the same thing too. "Spicy beef noodles and Pig Intestines" Yes you read right! I eat pig intestines. It's super yummy! Don't knock it til you've tried it. :) This is a Taiwanese restaurant that serves the handmade noodles with the noodle plates and varies Taiwanese specialties. They serve their soup noodles in a HUGE bowl and you feel like your tummy's going to blow after each meal. Portions are huge for the price that they charge. Too bad this place is kinda far from home or I'd eat it everyday! :) It's a definite must eat!

This is now the most reliable place to get good, cheap Chinese food in Downtown Mountain View. ?Fu Lam Mum filled that niche for years, but now that they've renovated and raised their prices, it's Queen's House's to take. The food here's not bad. ?Nothing will blow you away, but it's Chinese food done well. ?The prices are great, especially the deal where you can get 3 dishes plus green onion pancakes for $20... perfect for larger groups. ?Plus you can stop next door at Tea Era, owned by the same folks, and bring in good cheap pearl milk tea to drink with your meal. ?The atmosphere at Queen's House is, well, kind of rundown and greasy, but what do you expect from a Chinese restaurant?

They have "Thick squid soup with vermicelli." ?I was sold on that. ?But too much flour batter and not enough squid. ?Soup was nice and thick (starchy) and unhealthy for you. ?Big bowl, not Taibei street vendor-sized bowl. ?$5.95. Then I had to go ahead and order deep fried tofu (though the thick soy sauce had lots of garlic, it was tasteless. ?But compared to deep fried tofu in Sacramento, it was better). ? The "chive box" for $2.95 was good. ?My 10 year old niece who's never had Taiwanese food devoured half of it. ? Shlimp flied lice was quite tasty. ?Surprised. ? Chicken ho fun looked good and I was told by the kids it was yummy. ?I guess MSG makes everything taste good! It all came to just under $35 with tip. ?I'd say that was pretty good.

Their 3 dishes special comes in good size! Beef Stew clay pot - It's sooo yummy, I can eat a couple bowl of rice with just the sauce :) ?It has very tender beef, tofu, daikon, carrot, and more in it. yum yum Salt n pepper fish - nice & crispy, the best thing is it's not too salty!! Just the way I like it Garlic stirred fry pea sprout - fresh and light that goes well with other dishes -Small little places, so come early for dinner to ensure no wait. ? -They also partner with the Tea Era next door, so you can order bubble tea with your meal - Their homemade dumpling is GREAT too, very juicy and it's like the size of a golf ball Braces friendly: Salt n pepper fish and beef stew clay pot

I'm still trying to figure out this place. I know some people like it, but there's definitely a trick to knowing what on the menu is worth ordering. The one time I order some pork dish, the meat was awful. The green onion pancakes are okay but a bit oily. The Tan Tan Mein was tasty and hot although when it was served to me in China, they used thinner noodles. The xiao long bao have skins that are way too think and little soup. It's an okay place and definitely reasonably priced. Still, I wouldn't count it as a regular place for me.

It's a toss up between 3 and 4 stars for me. I'll give a 3 since my last experience there wasn't as good as I remembered. Highlights * cheap * cozy and warm * greasy * tasty * 3-cup chicken! Lowlights * greasy * quality seems to vary * beef noodle soup not very good Overall, it's a cheap place to eat and a good place to hang out with friends. Service isn't bad for a Chinese restaurant (not great either). It's a small place, so wait times can vary. Overall, it's a place worth trying. Note I've only been there for dinner

The price / quality ratio is pretty damn good. However, once you take the price out of the equation the food is not particularly memorable. It isn't bad by any means, but there is nothing special about this place. But yeah, a cheap place to grab a bite when you are not picky.

- Beef noodle soup (stew + tendons) = excellent. ?Would be even better if they could add in handmade noodles. ?Oh, if only. ?:) - Pork, shrimp, and veggie dumplings - good but the skin was a little too thick. - Rice w/chopped pork ("Taiwanese style") - good and flavorful but not my favorite - Black milk tea w/honey - super fragrant and good Would definitely return for the beef noodle soup and a maybe on other dishes.

The beef tendon and stewed meat noodle soup is AMAZING! ?The tendons and meat is stewed to perfection, an explosion of flavor and just the right texture. ?The soup base is not too oily so it makes a very comfortable meal. ?Highly recommend both the Spicy or Non-Spicy version. ? Service is friendly and the place is quite busy but the people there move fast, so about 10 - 15 mins wait. ?Parking behind the restaurant is plenty (big city parking lot that's free)

Food: 4 | Service: 3 | Ambiance: 3 | Price: 5 = 4 stars minus 1 for serving old chicken =[ As three college students stumbling upon the hidden gems of Castro St., my friends and I opted for Queen's House to fulfill that home-cooked Asian meal craving we've had for quite some time. I liked: - the $21 for 3 main dishes + rice / scallion cake - that the drinks are from Tea Era next door I disliked: - finding parking on Castro Street (it's nonexistent) - my experience with General Tso's chicken I'm a fan of their kung pao shrimp (they're generous with the portions!), and spicy eggplant dish. We also ordered General Tso's chicken which -- yes, I'm whitewashed -- I usually love. I was disappointed when I had to gnaw at the pieces, though. Really tasted as though it had been re-dipped in grease after sitting on the counter for the day. Yes, I can tell and no, I was not happy. I'm still hopeful enough to give Queen's House many tries.... for good, cheap Asian cuisine in the Stanford Area, why not? After reading some reviews of their Taiwanese dishes, I'll keep you posted on how that turns out next!

3.5 stars. ? The 3 cups chicken is out-of-this-world wonderful. ?If you only order one dish, this should be it, though from a dietary perspective, it's not well balanced, being lightly fried chicken wings in a sweet basil-garlic-ginger sauce. ?The Mongolian beef was more than forgettable, something that could have been predicted. ?Each dish is $9, and then you have to add rice on top. ?In all, not cheap chinese. ?I've had the string beans before, and they are great. Will have to come back for the beef stew noodles...

It is okay borderline place... not gonna go back though Ordered general tso chicken and the beef noodles soup. ?The beef noodle soup was on par but the Americanized Chinese food was HORRIBLE!!! ?The chicken strips was OVER FRIED... the texture of the chicken was like beef jerky but with chicken... it was so dry and tough that I didn't finish even half of the plate. ?Since i used to work in a restaurant and the best way to seal in the flavor is through frying, I must conclude that they had given me old, double/triple fried chicken that was probably left over from a canceled order. Me no likey old tough chicken.

For a college student, it's a bit expensive, but Queen's House has excellent quality food! I've been a regular for little over a month, and it's been nothing but great service for me. I always order the salt and pepper squid with rice, since I'm a seafood fanatic. The squid has a wonderfully crispy exterior, and the squid is not too chewy as other restaurants make it. It's actually quite tender and doesn't stress the jaws at all. The onions, red peppers, and jalapenos are also seasoned greatly as well. The white rice was cooked to a very standard consistency as well. I've had a couple other dishes as well. - Another favorite of mine is the salted fish and chicken fried rice. While it's cooked pretty standardly here, the salted fish is unevenly distributed, some bites being just too salty while others are bland. - The eggplant in garlic sauce was cooked to perfection, and totally excelled the quality of my girlfriend's Kung Pao Beef (which was alright) - The egg flower soup was great, but the soups here are BIG, not individual sized! Lucky I came with my family that time! This restaurant's a worthy part of Castro, and thank god it's next to Tea Era =D

Came here as one of our stops in a food/drink tour of Castro street. This was our second stop and all we wanted to do was snack on some dumplings. We sat down and ordered pork dumplings (12 pieces per order) and a large tsingtao beer. "No!" says the lady taking our order. She opens the menu and points to the bottom that says something along the lines of "minimum $5 per person". Uh okay. There were four of us and we just wanted a snack, but we'll order more. We also ordered the vegetable dumplings, hot/sour soup, and soy milk. 10 mins later another lady comes back and says they are out of vegetable dumplings. So we sub for tofu and preserved egg since my cousin is a vegetarian. The food came out and the only decent dish was the hot and sour soup. I mean, you can't really mess that up. The dumplings tastes like a regular dumpling, but needed dipping sauce. The tofu came with shredded pork on top (sorry meatless cousin, no food for you), and the soy milk came from a delivery person from the store next door? Weird. Overall it was a strange experience, but good for some laughs. If we ever do come back, I guess we'll need to bring someone that knows what to order.

I prefer dirty, cheap, and questionable Chinese restaurants. ?I want the windows to haven't been cleaned in years so that it looks like 4 walls with no window. ?I want my feet to stick to the floor so I know the roaches have to walk on the walls or ceilings. ? I don't like this place. ?Again, I don't like this place for 2 reasons; bad food and service. ?The only 2 things I care about and they do neither of them. ?Their chicken and prawns are acceptable, but their beef is atrocious. ?It's chewy and bland...I rather have taco bell beef (joking). ?Service, what service? ?Our waiter was being waited on when we had lunch, literally! ?He was sitting at a table and someone from the kitchen brought him some food. ?This is at 11:20am, eat your lunch before the place opens. ?

First time having Taiwanese beef noodle soup and it was okay. I enjoyed the beef, but there were way, way, way too many tendon/fat pieces. I liked the thick white noodles, but they weren't all that fresh. Maybe having so much ramen around the bay area, I just expect fresh and chewy noodles. The soup was a bit oily, but doesn't tastes as salty as it looks. The restaurant was small, so the tables were literally next to each other. Imagine sharing a table with strangers...which is exactly how we felt.

Tried this place on a whim for lunch, and found it to be pretty good. ?The decor isn't anything to write home about, and we had to wait quite a while for the waitress to take our order, but once the food came things got better. They actually give you real chop sticks, not the disposable splintery wood things you find in most restaurants these day. ?The hot and sour soup was quite good and loaded with stuff. ?The entrees were good as well, though somewhat uninspired. ?A good place to eat, but nothing out of the ordinary.

I first stumbled onto Queen House when strolling down Castro street looking for lunch - it was crowded with an asian clientele - always a good indication for a whitey like me that the food is good. I have since brought back many friends for the inexpensive, family set meal. ?You can choose 3 dishes from a group of dishes and you'll still have leftovers. ?Order the scallion pancakes as the appetizer. ?They are to die for. When I'm eating along, I order the beef tendon noodle soup. Its spicy and really delicious - very filling.

My yelp stars are based on the value received - and for such a low price, you get much better food than you'd expect. ?Five adults (one not really hungry) and two kids had lunch here for $45 including tip, and there were leftovers. This place is always crowded, so much so we've only been in here once before. ?This time we arrived early on a Sunday, when most of the other restaurants didn't even open until noon or so. ?This place can apparently sustain itself opening an hour earlier than the rest of Castro Street. We're gringos, so we got our kind of food - the peppery hot and sour soup, served just as I like it with lots of tofu but no pork or shrimp. ?General's chicken was astounding, crisp inside its sauce. ?We also got perfectly textured green beans (though not as spicy as I make them myself). ?Broccoli beef was OK but not a "wow" dish like the others. The smoothies from Tea Era next door were OK, but don't expect fruit in them - it's just sugar syrups and flavorings like a non-carbonated Icee. The bathroom is scary, the environment crowded, but we had a good meal at a good price.

I'd give this place a 3.5 based on the pork over rice dish. ?I'm hoping some of the other dishes will be good too. First time we were here we got: 1. beef noodle soup - alright but much prefer the A&J one. ?this one has not enough depth and a little too sweet and spicy. 2. three cup chicken - very good flavor if you don't mind the bones. ?may order again. 3. home style tofu - alright but not great. ?sauce is very bla. 4. green onion pancake - good but a little oily. on another visit we tried: 1. taiwan pork on rice - very good. tastes very authentic. ?definitely would order again. 2. ?napa cabbage with rice cake - alright only. ?probably won't order again.

You can't really go wrong with Queen's House: above-average homestyle Chinese food at very cheap prices. Their 3 dishes for $15 deal is amazing and they're really generous with their portions. Anytime I'm ever in the mood for some good Chinese food without hurting my wallet, I always suggest Queen's House and I've never been disappointed. Sure, their service sucks, but c'mon, what do you expect from a Chinese restaurant? Go for the prices & the food and leave all that good service mumbo-jumbo to the fru-fru French restaurants. We Chinese people spit on good service.

A friend of mine brought me a here about a week ago. He said it was more authenticate Taiwanese than most other spots and incredibly good. As I'm writing this review, i can see why, out of 217 reviews, that is has been rated so high. This place is a no-nonsense eatery, as you are essentially packed in like cigarettes in a pack. There is not much room between you and the next table, which can lead to hearing some odd conversations. Next to us, there were some uber-dweebs talking about taking over the word, Narf! Although, it was probably just fodder about the online game, and not a New World Order. My entree was the Beef w/ Mushroom, which I must say was out of this world good. Asian cuisine is my favorite,and it's not often that a place's cuisine stands out amongst the rest. My friend equally liked his dish, as many of those around us did (Remember packed in like Cigarettes!). If you are in the area and want some economic, great tasting Taiwanese cuisine, than definitely check this place out!

Food: 5 stars Service: 3 stars Ambiance: 3 stars Overall: 5 stars I wasn't planning to review this place cuz it has so many already. ?But i wanted to add it to my list of faves, so why not give it a review. ?I LUV the Taiwanese dishes here. ?They make it just like home. ?So we've perfected our ordering down for 2 ppl and always crave and order the same things. Onion pancake - must Beef noodle soup, spicy, thick noodles - must Sticky rice in a barrel - must Chives in a box - must, but sometimes they're out of this because they hand make it And for a 5th snack dish, we vary it up all the time. Sometimes it's potstickers or another noodle or rice dish. ?We haven't ordered their plate specials yet, but i see a lot of non-asians ordering that stuff and it looks good as well. ?Place can get pretty busy since it's a small place. ?But they've re-arranged the chairs to fit more people. ?The best part is that we leave the place w/ only a $15-18 bill (this stuffs two ppl!).

Went tonight for the first time - food was OK three of us ate with beer for $42 - including 3 main dishes: ?Cashew chicken; shrimp and black bean sauce; broccoli beef; a tureen of beef-noodle soup; onion pancake; leeks in a basket (biscuit?) and white rice. ?The food came out very fast. ?It was good - didn't get to order really spicy stuff because a guy in our party didn't care for 3-alarm hot stuff. ?I liked the soup (it had lots of bok choy) and the onion-in-a-bucket. I hate to say this - but I am geared more for Chef Chu's, Tao Tao's and PF Chang's. The staff was very pleasant and friendly. They did not serve tea or give us fortune cookies with the bill. ?I miss reading my fortune. ?Oh well. Not sure I will go back with so many other establishments around. ?This place is walking-distance from my house, though. ?It was good, not great. ?I did like the soup, though. I didn't know they had potstickers and dumplings. ?So maybe I'll visit one more time.

Good value - the daily dinner 3 dishes deal I think for $19.99 is an awesome deal. The best dish there - 3 cup tofu (fried tofu in a sweetish basil sauce). ?3 cup chicken is also good. Aside from the 3 cup dishes, the soup noodles are yummy and a good value.

Even though it was a somewhat warm day, I was fiending for something a bit spicy so I ordered the spicy shrimp and beef noodle soup. It had a nice spice and was very filling. The broth was very flavorful, except the beef and the shrimp pretty much were tasteless. ?The veggies were plentiful as were the egg noodles, but lacked in pieces of shrimp and beef. I wasn't impressed with the service as our water glasses were never refilled the whole time we were eating; let's just say I was sweatin' pounds for jeebuz eating the spicy soup.

A co-worker recommended this place to me and billed it as an authentic Taiwanese restaurant. Since I'm from Taiwan, naturally the bar was immediately set really high. I wanted to like this place, but it was underwhelming. I ordered the stewed ground pork over rice, which is a traditional Taiwanese dish and one that I love. I liked the fact that the ground pork had fatty bits as well as meaty bits. Unfortunately, the meat had a very gamey flavor, which suggested to me that it was not properly cleaned. The restaurant doesn't offer that many vegetarian options. So I asked for vegetarian recommendations for my boyfriend. She suggested General Tso's tofu and the vegetarian chow mein, which are just throw-away dishes for the undiscerning diners. As expected, those dishes were boring and bland. The place itself was small and the service was a bit slow. ?Overall, not a great experience and certainly not the "authentic Taiwanese restaurant" that I was hoping for.

Had lunch there on a Saturday. Note that they don't do lunch specials on Saturday but you can get some soup for about the same price. What you can get on Saturdays is families. The kind of families where the kids are walking all over the shared booth seats and make blurbing nooses into the mirror while their moms talk on the phone and ignore. The kind of families where the grown up son is relaxed enough to cross his legs and wave his bare feet inches away from you. Are you starting to get the picture? I rated the restaurant 3 stars because the food came quick, there were lots of vegetables, the soup was piping hot, the broth was average, and the shrimp looked like they had been in the freezer on a long transoceanic cruise. Meh, I just down graded to two stars thinking about that dude's bare feet.

Been here several times, the food is generally ok. I like the beef stew noodle soup, the beef is tender and the soup tastes more herbal than those I've tried at other restaurants (and I don't like that those are too salty). Tea Era (IMO, the best boba tea in Bay area) next door is owned by the same owner, you can order boba tea at Queen House. I've also tried other dishes like the onion pancake, oyster omelette (so-so...it's too starchy for my liking), sticky rice, etc. What annoys me about this place is that if you order from the set menu, they dictate how many people must share. If you aren't "accounted for", you won't even get plate/chopsticks. On one occasion we weren't that hungry but felt "forced" to order more than we wanted. They're also inflexible about changing items on the set menu. Overall, good value-for-money if you wanna grab a quick bite and aren't too particular about the service/ambience.

One thing you notice when you first walk in is that almost every table has a bowl of their spicy beef noodle soup. Without a doubt, they make it very well. It's slightly on the sweeter side but DAMN GOOD! Every single time my family and I come here, my sister always orders the Taiwanese minced pork over rice. I must say, it is pretty authentic- you can actually see the layers of fat on the mini pork cubes! Definitely not for those looking for a light meal. Their ji juan (chicken roll) is not bad either, but my grandma makes the worlds best ji juan. If you're looking for a place to fill your Taiwanese food craving, Queen's House is your place

The Taiwanese beef noodle soup is typically what this place is known for for spicy noodle fans. I have been here several times and every time it tasted really good. Make sure not to eat the fatty stuff and set it aside to avoid a heart attack and your good to go. Servers forget easily so ask multiple times to get their attention.

"I have been eating here since 1993. And I have yet to find a better noodle house. This place is all about the noodle soup. If you want an American rice dish go somewhere else. This reastaurant is not for you. However, if you want fresh made noodles, this is the place to go. Make sure you get the thick noodle soup, you can tell it is hand made because the noodles do not have a uniform thickness to them. I took a group of co-workers here, and they have been regulars for over 5 years. They are there every Thursday for lunch. If you are not up for a broth soup, and you like spicy food, try the Tan Tan noodle dish, Trust me you will not have anything like this elsewhere. Noodles in a spicy sauce with ground pork and mushrooms. And the price is unbeatable for the amount of food you get. Most soups are in the $6 range. Less than $7 with tax and tip. If you are going for lunch, get there early, the place is small and the tables fill up fast. It is not uncommon to see a line out of the door. --Ed"

Our kids asked for noodles yesterday. ?So I searched Yelp for Noodle. ?This restaurant popped up near the top. ?We gave it a try. The restaurant was really small and packed. ?Luckily, we got the last table and didn't have to wait. ?After we read the menu, we asked the waitress what they were famous for and what was the most popular dish. ?The waitress said their beef noodle was famous. ?However, my wife didn't feel like having beef noodle. ?So we ordered a chicken noodle with veggie, Chao Ma noodle, some appetizers and an order of pot stickers. Even my kids noticed that the skins of the pot stickers were dry and tough as if they were not fully cooked. ?The chicken noodle was okay, but the Chao Ma noodle was way too oily. ?I could see a layer of grease covering everything. ?The texture of the noodle was good, like hand-pulled noodle. ?The soup base was not as good as those I got from "Do Re Mi" in North San Jose. ?The ingredients and topping was not as good as those I got from Tsing Tao in Campbell. ?Overall it was okay though it might not be very healthy because of the grease. When we are in the mood, we want to try their specialty, the beef noodle. ?I hope it is not as greasy as the other dish. I also noticed that they have dinner special at $20 for 3 dishes from a large selection in the menu. ?We may want to try their dinner special sometime in the future.

Four stars simply for value, speed, and taste. ?This place is one of the few that is kind of actually serves thing like they would in Taiwan. ?Granted things can be a bit too salty and oily, but for the amount of good you get for the price, heck, gimmie more I say. the dumplings here are of great value. ?you get a dozen for under $5, and they're huge! ?They're boiled but dip them in their sauce and they're mighty tasty.

What really sets this place apart too are the noodles they use. ?They're hand pulled and fresh, so they're traditional in the way that they're nice and thick. ?They taste great in their soups and their Dan Dan Noodles (also nice and spicy!). Would've been five stars, but the sodium content and the five years I've lost of my life expectancy from it knock it down a notch.

Small family owned restaurant that doesn't have too many tables. The max number of people that they can accomodate per party is 4. It gets packed at 12noon. They are closed on Tuesdays! I always get the spicy beef noodle soup as well as the garlic sauteed pea sprouts. The noodles are fresh and the soup is hot. Prices are reasonable.

I ate here a couple times off their "3 for whatever (can't remember the price)" menu and found the food to be pretty average chinese food. Then I went in one time by myself and the waitress recommended the Schezuan Beef Noodle Soup. Damn! That Noodle Soup is addicting - I actually crave it and drive out of my way to come get it every couple of weeks. And $6.40? 5 Stars my friends, 5 stars.

This is what I consider to be higher on the scale standard-fare Chinese food. Definitely worth a trip if you're hungry and have a few bucks in your pocket. Honestly, thats all it really costs. I got the family style tofu, which I think is the most glorious thing on the face of the earth. In theory at least - I've been to some places that can really screw up good tofu. Queens House definitely made it right - and the time from order to on the table was really fast. I was there early though (around 4pm - I hadn't eaten all day!) so that could explain the quick turnaround. Anyhow, I'd go back any day. I'd definitely take this place over some of the other places in MV, especially Chef Liu's. Less posturing and better food. Very good stuff.

Came back here for Taiwanese style brunch last Sunday (8/23/2009) after Sunday service @ CCIC MV with 2 friends. we had: -- savory soy milk x2 -- spicy beef noodle soup -- rice cake stir-fried w/ green vegetables -- sesame pancake + meat sandwich -- (they ran out of the salty sticky rice roll though).. all of these tasted great, the total bill came out to ~$30..

I'm pretty sure the owner of this place also owns Tea Era next door because you can order stuff from Tea Era when you order food here. ?Unfortunately, the food here isn't as good as the tea next door. ?If you want a place that's fast and cheap, come to queen house. ?There are a few dishes that are pretty good but most of the things I've tried make me wanna go eh. ? The spicy beef noodle soup here is good. ?It comes out piping hot as it should. ?Even got my friend to sweat on her upper lip...prolly the best memory I have of this place haha. ?Most of their lunch rice plates are just average. ?The meat is usually low quality and the flavor seems to be found more in the sauces around it and never actually in the meat itself. ? The lunch plates come with complimentary salad and soup...both of which are bad. ?There's usually a line outside during lunch. ?Partially because it's popular but partially because the place is pretty small. ?I'll probably come a few more times just to try a few more dishes. ?I want to see if I'm missing out on anything.

One of the more economical restaurants along castro street in downtown MV. Though some reviews and the article featuring this restaurant in the Mountain View voice newspaper rave about the noodles, husband and I much prefer the fried rice. The quality can be a little inconsistent but when its good, the fried rice is tasty (basically sufficiently salty) and aromatic (the smoky flavor which comes from a well seasoned and hot wok). They recently introduced a new fried rice item - the Bacon Basil fried rice with black pepper. This fried rice has a pretty distinct flavor profile from the other fried rices on the menu, I suspect people will either love it or hate it. I've definitely not had a fried rice which tastes like that but its my new love at Queen's House. The sweet and sour chicken is crispy even after being drenched in the sauce and on our table for about 20 minutes. Its good if you like the classic americanized sweet and sour chicken. Before discovering the fried rice, I've tried the pan- fried beef rice noodle which I found to be tasteless and too oily. I hardly had any and didnt even bother to take the rest away. The beef tendon noodle soup is flavorful but too heavy so I felt sick by the time I was half way too. The vegetable noodle soup on the other hand was almost tasteless.... In short, this is an economical place for a quick meal in downtown MV with dishes of varying quality.

We go here often! ?It's affordable and fresh. The spicy shrimp and beef noodle soup is to die for. I crave it often. There is a set menu which many people order for their family "to go" or to "eat in" ?It costs under $25 for 3 dishes and rice or soup. The salted and fried pork or fish, tofu, and spicy shredded pork and veggie dish is so hot! ? I love it. ? Vegetable dishes are always very fresh. ?My favorite noodle soups here cost from about $6.95-8.50. ?The serving is large and two people who aren't too hungry could share.

(Sigh) It is with regret I inform fellow yelpers that Queen's House no longer serves the beloved stinky tofu. When I went there July 3rd, the waitress informed us that due to complaints by non-Chinese customers the dish is no longer served. Which means I will have to make the longer trek to Shimbala in Cupertino. We all had a hearty laugh with the waitress however (thinking about the customers who complain so much they would move to another table). Other than that, we ordered a few classics: green onion pancake, crispy chicken nuggets, and beef stew. All were pretty good but not the best Taiwanese food around (even for the bay area). The waitresses were friendly, prices were decent. And oh yes, my husband got splashed by raw chicken being cut a bit too vigorously in the kitchen on the way to and from the bathroom so now you have been warned.

Absolutely the best for Beef Noodle Soup. ?I have gone around the world in search of better and there is none.. ?please advise if you think there is a better place. Other good dishes are the clay pots, esp the 3 cup chicken. Alot of the plain jane dishes like beef broccoli, general chicken, etc are not that great. ?They are really good for the handmade noodles and claypot dishes.

Good, inexpensive food and rude staff! Chefs screaming something in mandarin at each? The kitchen always sounds like everyone is going to kill each other? I would recommend getting it to go. Their combo menu is a pretty sweet deal. The Shanghai bao is the best - hands down over other places. However, their other dishes can be hit and miss. Hopefully the chef misses me during one of his tirades.

Hmm ... this place seemed to be populated all the time, which is a good sign most of the time, right? Well, not for us and not in this time. We were looking at the menu from outside and a passer by said that it was a great place to try, she even recommended the Chicken Kung Pao. OK .. we were hungry and looking for a replacement to Windy's (Palo Alto) Chinese food (which has closed sadly). ? So we both looked at the offerings and chose the Kung Pao Chicken, pork chow mien noodles and the vegetable dumplings. Waited for 15 minutes, went across the street to browse some shops, and returned. We came back to our package and brought it home, 5 minutes away. Opened the boxes and it looked OK. Then came to taste, the Kung Pao had NO flavor! The noodles tasted fishy and ?the dumplings also lacked any flavor without my own chili paste to give it some. All in all, I would say my visit was pretty disappointing. I may give it another try with fried offerings (pretty hard to mess up) and possibly the noodle soups, it seemed they were quite popular and possibly very tasty. So .. for lack luster food, fishy taste and simply blandness (I've never had Chinese / Taiwanese take out so bland) it will get 2 stars because it didn't get me sick. Although, I think my boyfriend did - but that's for him to review.

There's a tea drink shop next to this tight space restaurant which are owned by the same owner, as my friend told me when we got there. I can tell you that it's really small becauase as I was trying to get the drinks that I bought for my friends from the tea shop to the restaurant, the waitress that was cleaning up the tables with plates in her hands almost knocked into me. ?Luckily, nothing got on me or else I would have raise hell. ? Anyways, the food is all right. ?We ordered the "3 cup chicken", which is marinated small chicken wings in a metal pot, the string beans, as well as the preserved vegetable stir fried with pig's intestine was ok, nothing special. ?But I would like to point out that the noodle soups are very very good (especially the spicy ones). ?The price is very inexpensive also. ?If you like Chinese food that is tasty and won't burn your wallet, this is a good place to go, but only go there when it's not busy.

I decided to try this place since they serve the hot sweet soybean milk with the chinese donuts. Not many places in the south bay serve this! I'm giving this place two stars...due to: * Service - I told the waitress the number and name of the dishes I wanted to order and also pointed to them on the menu and she had to ask me three times. I had a party of two and they sat me at a table for four and squished another party of two at my table. When food would arrive they would ask you and your neighboring tables who ordered the items. ? * Disappointment w/ the dishes I ordered - I choose the wonton in SPICY sauce and tan tan noodles (they both had the jalapeno sign = SPICY). For some reason, both of my dishes were sweet and not spicy. I've had the wontons at other restaurants and it usually marinated in a spicy chili oil soy sauce and at Queen's it was a thick sweet peanut sauce. As for tan tan noodles just plain sweet and no spiciness at all! * No ice in the water....no comment! I should of ordered the beef noodle soup, but I was craving tan tan noodles. The place was packed, even though the reviews on yelp are so so. I don't think I will be going back to this place.

Had the spicy beef noodle soup. ?It was quite spicy and my mouth went numb half way through the meal. ?The meat was excellent with some nice amount of fat. ?I helped myself to the water in the sliding fridge since I needed to put out the mini inferno the spices in the soup caused. ?After sweating like a fat man in a sauna for 10 minutes I managed to finish my noodles. ?If I ever head this way agian I will be sure to get myself another serving of this delicious yet painful noodle.

I come here quite often with my parents, as this is one of their two favorite Chinese restaurants. Three cups chicken: DELICIOUS!! Very annoying to eat, but whatever... Their clay pot dishes are awesome. Esp the veggie one...that's saying a lot considering I'm a huge carnivore. it's large enough for at least 2 if not 3 people. And it's really good (MSG maybe? haha). I advise people to stay away from the fried rices...and I actually think their beef noodle soup is meh, but gotta love the clay pots =) The pearl milk tea at tea era is surprisingly good! I think I like it more than Verde... Overall pretty good

This place serves up a good selection of Taiwanese food. Portions are pretty large for the price, so I would say they are a pretty good deal. The "Northern style scallion pancake" is huge... I will also comment that I feel like the food here is a little on the sweet side. Dishes that are typically spicy also have a sugary sweetness at Queen's House. I will leave it up to you to decide if you like that or not... Overall, decent service, low prices, decent food. I would definitely return.

So met my girlfriend there for dinner because she said they have the best Beef Noodle Soup than any other places she tried. The place is located on Castro Street in Mt. View. ?It's easy to find, but parking is the issue which is not their fault. Go into the place. As expected with all Taiwanese restaurant, it's tiny hole in the wall, but it's clean. ?My husband and I joined my friend who was already seated. ?She was eating soft tofu with thousand year old egg. ?Which I love, but they piled a bunch of bonito flakes on top of the tofu you can't see the tofu, not to mention this is so not the ?Chinese way of serving it. ?Hello, if I want bonito flakes I go to a Japanese restaurant. The wait staff was attentive. ?We only had to wave her down 1x to place our order and she came around through out the evening ?enough for me to ask for extra napkins, togo boxes, and the check. At my girlfriend's urging, I ordered the Beef Noodle Soup (Spicy), and was instantly disappointed. The broth is not very flavreful. ?To spice it up, they just added chili sauce which is the same as the table chili sauce. ?I was shocked. ?My husband ordered veggie chow mein and the noodle was not fully cooked. ?It was chewy and gross. ?We also ordered onion cakes. ?It was thin, oily, and soggy. Not very good. I felt bad for not liking the place because I knew my friend really like it, but even she commented that her beef noodle is not as tasty this time. Final verdict is I had better so will not return for a 2nd trip. Sorry.

Came here for dinner and ordered the following: -Spring roll: Crispy and tasty - Beef noodle soup: I like the big chunks of beef and noodles except the soup was pretty oily. - Green beans with shrimps: This dish was good, nothing exciting. It took us a while to flag down a waiter for services except the server dropped off the check when two slow eaters were half way done with the meal. I guess good service isn't the selling point of this place.

I really like grabbing lunch from this spot after my Saturday morning pick-up basketball games. If you like Taiwanese food, give this place a try. I usually rotate between two items: General Tso's Chicken and Lu Rou Fan. Out of all the places that have some version of GTC, I think this place makes the best one! The level of sweetness and spiciness is perfect, and the chicken is all white meat (which I'm a big fan of). You'll need to order some steamed rice separately, but it's well worth it. As far as the Lu Rou Fan goes, it may not be the cheapest around ($5.99 is quite a lot for a bowl of it), but it's still delicious. I noticed that they recently started to accept credit cards as well, a huge plus in my book. The minimum is $10, but that's not hard to hit. I think this place might be a little underrated; give it a shot. I bet you'll enjoy it!

I have been to this place twice now. It serves very decent chinese food at a pretty affordable price for the location it has...right on Castro @ downtown MV. I love the small cramped seating they have....its quite comfortable. They serve free tea at your table..in a personal tea pot which I totally love. Its not as strong or flavorful but def. warms you up. I have tried the hot and sour noodle soup and pan fried vegetable noodles....both were not bad at all...but servings are huge!! So...bring an appetite. Staff is nice and friendly....they help you through the menu and help you make selections. However, wait time is unusually long...about 20 mins atleast...which sucks...but when the food comes...its nice..fresh and piping hot....so its kinda ok...but not when you are starving!

I ADORE their Szechuan beef noodles. Everywhere else I go I try to find a comparable bowl of beef noodles, but I always leave wishing I had gone on Queen's House instead. It's spicy, it's tasty, and the beef is amazing tenderness. The only caveat to this place is that it's small, and can get really crowded. When that happens their service, which isn't fantastic normally, becomes extremely bad. I usually order right when I sit down, since I already know what I want.

Our favorite Chinese restaurant. ?Recommended by our Chinese friends for its authentic Taiwanese taste, Queen's House is filling and scrumptious without being greasy. ?The large menu contains soups, meats, poultry, veggie dishes, noodles, and desserts, and just about everything we have tried is good. ?The prices are hard to beat as well: less than $10 per person for a complete dinner including a drink. The prawns in spicy tomato sauce is excellent, as is the pan friend chow mein deluxe. ?We also like the sauteed bean spouts dish quite a lot.

When I first arrived at lunch I was excited to see 40% of the patrons had beef noodle soup. This got me a little moist, cause I've been craving for some good Taiwanese style BNS for sometime now. After 5 min. of waiting I was seated and without looking at the menu I told the waitress "BNS please!" She asked whether I wanted hot or not, I told her, heck yea! drop it like it's hot. The noodles came out fast and the bowl size was impressive. I quickly took a sip of the soup and was hoping it would take me back to memory lane. Instead of memory lane, I felt I was taken to the side alley, beaten up and robbed. ?I was not impressed by their noodles or soup at all. Too much hype about their beef noodle soup. It was a bit on the bland and sweet side. ?Wouldn't go back for BNS cause it ain't legit. Would go back and try some of their other offerings.

Great service - really nice and fast waitresses! ?Unfortunately the food wasn't as good as the service. ?The Kung Pao Chicken was halfway decent - relatively spicy, slightly undercooked vegetables. ?The Chow Mein was absolutely flavorless, with bland chicken, beef, and shrimp. ?The sweet and sour shrimp was more fried batter than shrimp. ?

So, we came here since it was reviewed on Yelp and it seemed to be fairly inexpensive. ?Our group ordered Mu Shu Pork, Beef Clay Pot and Seaweed with Dry Bean Curd. ? Good : Seaweed with Dry Bean Curd, tasted good and seemed home made. Okay: Mu Shu Pork. ?It was mainly american cabbage with a smidge of pork, and egg. ?Maybe there was a bit of bamboo shoot. ?The best thing I can say is that they used authentic Chinese pancakes and not just tortillas or spring roll wrappers. ? Bad: ?Beef Clay Pot. ?The beef clay pot was made with beef tendons, which were beyond fatty. ?They put a lot of daikon, carrots and fried tofu. ?Although the beef was okay, the rest was tasteless. ?The sauce was really oily. ? I guess if you order the set dinner at 22.99 , it's a great deal for three people. ?Otherwise I would advise looking for another place.

Really more of a 3.5, but I thought I'd round up. Right from the start I really wanted to like this place. Having spent the last two summers in Taiwan I was really looking forward to this place. I came here with my brother and some friends on a Friday night and the wait was about a half hour. No surprise here given what I've read on yelp and hey, its Castro St. on a Friday night, what do you expect? Once we were in, I looked through the menu and while there was a decent selection of Taiwanese dishes, it really wasn't the experience I was hoping for. I guess I had my expectations to high and some dishes that I loved back in Taiwan will never make it overseas. We ended up ordering a few dishes that were all pretty good, but you can find them pretty easily in the bay. Don't get me wrong, the food (salt pepper fish, 3 cup chicken, beef tendon clay pot, pea sprouts, and dry-cooked string beans) were all really good. I think I just got my hopes up a little too high for what I thought might have been a meal reminiscent of my times back in Taiwan... I'll be back though. After all, the food were good and the price was great (~10 pp), but next time I'll keep my hopes in check.

LOVE the food there!! it is by far one of my favorite taiwanese restaurant. It is good for ordering dishes. They don't have very many "little eats" from taiwan. but their 3 dishes for i believe like 24.99 is very good, and comes with either steam rice or scallion cakes. The food rarely disappoints, so try anything and everything on the menu! The only thing i don't love is their hot oil dry wonton, to me its not very authentic. But everything else is YUM!!!! The place is very small, so do come early, if not you will have to wait. Also if you like spicy, don't forget to try their spicy beef noodle soup!!! YUM! just thinking about it makes me hungry!! :)

I am not a Chinese food expert, so coming here was a little out of my comfort zone. The menu doesn't do much to really describe the dishes in English, so I picked the garlic chicken. It was not as garlicky as I was expecting, and it just felt heavy and greasy to me. My husband had a beef dish, and my sister had a chicken and broccoli dish, they each seemed satisfied. It was really cramped, and I felt that the wait staff was trying to hustle us out to make more room for more customers, so that wasn't a very comfortable feeling. I will probably not come back here so that I can try other places.

I regret to say that the quality of the food has become inconsistent. ?Don't get me wrong, it is still one of the better Taiwanese restaurants featuring authentic taiwanese snacks/dishes in the bay area. ?But the decline in quality is evident. ?Here are my comments on a few of their signature dishes: Spicy Beef noodle soup: ?as many yelpers mentioned, this is by far their best dish. ?The soup base is by ?far the best in the bay area (thanks to a chef they hired from China). ?The quality of this dish has stayed excellent throughout the 4 years i've been eating here. ? 3-cup chicken: Becoming more and more inconsistent. ?last few times I've been there the chicken wings have either not been braised long enough or not been browned enough. ? Beef pot: my favorite dish has been going down in quantity as well as quality. ?It's clear that they make this dish in large quantities, freeze it and thaw it out in aliquots when ordered. Which is fine, except that now i've noticed they've been adding water to dilute sauce, which I guess allows them to use less materials per dish. ?Also, they are using a lot less beef brisket and you get more tendons instead. ?Very disappointing. 3-flavor dumplings: ?still excellent except it tends to run out due to its popularity. salt'n pepper fish/pork chop: ?pretty good interpretation of a classic cantonese dish. ?My only complain here is that the batter for the fish tends to be inconsistent at times, sometimtes too thick. It's clear that they are trying to cut cost and increase profit margin in order to deal with price inflation, but do they really need to skimp on the rice? ?we ordered the 3 dishes dinner combo they gave us barely enough rice for 2 bowls! c'mon man, ?you guys make enough money to take a vacation for 2 weeks the past Christmas break (it's true), you can at least try to keep your food consistent and don't skimp on the rice! ? Finally, in order to increase business, they've renovated their interiors recently. ?Now the interior looks quite nice and modern, but now the tables are even smaller! ?it's challenging to fit 3 dishes on one table. ?Also there is no privacy, you are privy to all the personal conversations around your table. ?For example, i learned that the couple to the right of us are planning a hiking trip while the guy to the left of us spent 3 hours listening to his country music collection. ? Conclusion: ?bring back the quality and stop skimping on the rice yo!

I love this place. It looks like it's family run. This place is very small and they do a great job on their soups. My personal favorite is the War Wonton soup. It should be called a stew, it is so full of meat, shrimp and vegetables that there's hardly any room for liquid. It's a meal in it's self. I really haven't had too many other dishes from their menu other than the combination fried rice and egg rolls and I thought those were also very good. Prices are also very fair. Keep up the good work

This is a pretty nice place for some quick and cheap Chinese food :). It's kind of a like a hole-in-wall type of place and can get crowded during meal hours. Service was all pretty bad (the wait staff don't even say hi). Food was great! Good portions and a nice variety to choose from. Coming in groups allows us to get the 3 dish for $20 deal, which make family style eating pretty fun. Great place for a quick bite.

This is kinda like an AUTHENTIC express Chinese place (NOT like Panda Express)..but a little bit better. I had the chow fun and is was pretty good. I didn't try anything else, but looking around, other dishes seemed really tempting. You can order drinks from Tea Era here too so that's a plus. Service was quick but it's not fancy so don't expect that much attention. I would like to come back and try other dishes one day.

i looove this place! perfect for a nice sit-down taiwanese lunch or dinner. as authentic as it gets. the place is well kept and pretty clean. its low on space though. kinda small and gets packed during lunch and dinner 7 days a week. if you wanna get outta here quick. then i recommend coming for late lunch. oh yea, and the only annoying thing is that the bathroom is next door in the tea shop owned by the same people. prices are reasonable and well worth the $6-7. i REALLY recommend the deep fried fish. dang, cant get enough of that stuff. the wonton soup has a special taste. it doesn't have the traditional taste, different but in a good way. their rice plates are also excllent and they have a lot of spicy dishes, for all you people into that stuff.....but yea, try this place out!

Passed by this place many times to get pudding tea at Tea Era. Didn't give Queen's House a try until a coworker told me that the food was great there. Tried a few dishes and thought the soup noodle dishes were by far the best on the menu. Didn't think too highly of the other items on the menu. But it's worth going here just for the soup noodle dishes. People usually get the standard beef noodle soup, can't really go wrong with that selection.

As the Prince of Taiwan, it is my culinary duty to inform all about the wonders of Taiwanese cuisine. My country is more than just stainky tofu dear Padawans. I busted out my madarin as soon as I entered this joint so they know that their Prince has arrived. This place rocks out with their co*ks out! We had the Taiwanese beef noodle soup, and this was so good we should fill up the engines of our Taiwan fighter jets instead of fuel if China ever decides to attack because we'd kick their asses with this powerfully delicious soup base. The beef was so tender, even the tendons, which are tradionally tough in other soups, like beef Pho. The wife also had the Pork intestines vermicelli, another Taiwan delicacy, some crispy fried chicken, their green onion pancake, and lastly, the chive in a box. The chive box is just a fancy way of describing a big fat fried dumpling filled with egg, greens, chives, and some bean thread. It's okay, but not worth the 4 bucks. All the other stuff though, kicks darth balls. We ate like pigs, had leftovers, and it was 30 bucks total, tax and tip. If the President of taiwan were here, he'd give it thumbs up too.

I guess this is a reliable place for Chinese food. ?My non-Chinese friends seem to like this place a lot, and I grudgingly admit the food is tasty - they have a fondness for General Tso's Chicken. ?I'm always intrigued by the Stinky Tofu on the menu. ?I love Stinky Tofu but I've never found anyone else willing to try it there with me. ?(Oh wait, I just read one of the reviews which said they don't serve it anymore, sad... I guess I missed my chance) ?The service here also sucks, but I suppose I come to expect that from a Chinese restaurant. ?The place is also kind of small, so it's hard to fit groups of more than 4 people in there.

The beef noodle soup here is great. I love the texture and chewiness of the handmade noodles. I also go here regularly on weekends for the 'weekend dimsum' - taiwanese style. The sesame rolls with beef are particularly good, and we also get the simmered ground pork over dry noodle along with the usual brunch fare. Service varies, but with prices so low (and an asian place to boot), I don't really expect much.

I stopped in here the other day after visiting my acupuncturist down the street for a hot bowl of noodles on a cold rainy day. I was pleasantly surprised by the generous size of the bowls which average about $6. The restaurant is located between Villa and Dana on Castro. The dining area is rather narrow and crowded. I came around 11:30 on a weekday. Another fifteen minutes, the rest of the place filled up and people were queued up outside for an open table. The restuarant is quite busy and the food is served quickly. However, you might have a bit of a wait getting your menu and then getting someone to take your order if it gets busy. The wait staff will eventually get around to you in their rushing about. I am limiting my review at this point to the noodles since I have only tried those so far. From what I can tell, it is a very popular choice at lunchtime. The Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup appears to be one of the most popular. I am a bit particular about this since so many places in the Bay Area ruin this dish. The beef was tender. The broth was fragrant and spicy with a slightly sweet, tangy flavor that was unusual. i would have liked this better without the sweet flavor, but you could chalk that up to my tendancy to avoid sweet flavors in my food. If you don't like spicy foods, you can try the plain beef stew noodle soup instead. I enjoyed the Snow Cabbage with Pork Noodle Soup much better. The noodles were topped with fresh salted cabbage, tender shreds of pork and slivered bamboo. The broth was rich and flavorful with a little bit of bite and heat from the white pepper. I really enjoyed this dish since the cabbage was so fresh and not overly cooked or soggy from sitting around in hot soup. The noodles used in the soup dishes are thick and chewy with a nice bite. I am looking forward to trying other items on the menu in the future. Update: I tried the eggrolls and scallion pancake. The scallion pancake was crisp on the exterior with a nice chewy texture on the interior. It was cooked fresh unlike many other places who pre-cook them and then reheat them rendering overly oily. The eggrolls were nicely crisped and stuffed with fresh vegetables.

***Update 12/10/07*** On our initial visit to Queen's House, I gave this place 4 stars. On behalf of my daughter, I'm taking away those stars, and if I could bring it down to zero I would for the way they treated her and her b/f this evening.. On my last visit to Queen's House, enough food so that we'd be able to bring home leftovers for another meal. My daughter and her b/f loved the food, so this evening she asked us where the Queen's House was located so that they could go and enjoy the same. When they were going out the door, I asked them to bring me home some hot and sour soup. She called me on her way home from the restaurant - very upset. The conversation went like this: "Hello" (me) "Hey Mom! I can't believe I received the worst service in my entire life!" )That says a lot to me - she's only 19. "Yeah? What happened?" "We had no problem getting our food, but onced we got our food, the waitress just ignored us even though we asked for more water. The waitstaff seemed to purposely ignore us - and when someone finally came to fill our glasses with water, the waitress gave us the nastiest look like we were inconveniencing her. We tried to be polite and say "Thank you" each time they brough each dish to our table but they looked like they were pissed every time they brought something to our table and totally blew us off. When I finally got the waitress' to come so that I could order your soup, it didn't seem like she understood what I was trying to ask her. She brought me an empty carton and tried to shove me the bill. We felt like we were being told to leave the restaurant by their behavior. She gave me an empty carton. I said, "No, I want to order a separate soup to go." But it seemed like she was mad that I asked for more water and soup - every time I asked her for something, she just rolled her eyes at us as she walked away. Then! I got the bill! The entire order only came to $20.23. They charged me $6 additional for the tax! They really tried to rip me off! The food was good, but there's no way we're going back there again!" $6 additional for tax for a $20 meal? That's not good. I wanted to like this place, liked the food, but after the sort of treatment my daughter received, I'm hesitant to patronize this place again. **************************************************?***************** Initial review: 11/23/07 - 4 stars We finally made it the day after turkey day - wanting something different than turkey leftovers. Their hot and sour soup is very good - a bit too peppery for S., but it definitely cleared out my sinuses. We also liked the pork and cabbage dumplings (A real deal! 12 dumplings for a very reasonable price!) and the shredded pork with Peking sauce. We were a little disappointed with the chinese broccoli with oyster sauce - the stems were a bit woody and hard to chew. The service was fast and friendly. We'll be back to sample more!

ah, this place is one of the most authentic places that i've tried for Taiwanese food. it used to be taiwan point in SF but now i found a replacement since they closed. the food here is much better then ay-chung noodle house. you can order Lou Ruo Fan (Taiwan Stew Pork over Rice), Dan Zi Mien (Stew Ground Pork with Noodle Soup), Sticky Rice, and Beef Stew Noodles. those i tried were very good too. the place is small and packed. you can choose to eat outside which my give you a bit more space and might be cooler if your planning to order Hot soup or stuff with a lot of heat. one of the waiter isn't taiwanese... they played the hottest songs like Bei Pan from Superstar Avenue. Best of all the food was good and i loved it. one side note is that, since i live in millbrae, and i can drive all the way over here. this means it's good. i'm coming back to try more next time. Oh btw, when your done. go next door and get some Boba drink. The best too.

When it comes to getting real food for a good price, Queen's House is the way to go. I've only ever been here for the beef noodle soup, but the large portions make it so worth it, plus there's a good enough of vegetables in it. However I think the type of noodle served at A & J's in Cupertion is superior, but if you want quantity over quality, Queens is the way to go. Plus last time I went they had redone the seating area, so it looks nicer.

Based on TanTan Noodles and Curry Taiwanese noodles. TanTan noodles--noodles were fine but sauce lacked depth. ?Could only taste mushrooms. ? There was about a teaspoon of meat in the dish, could that be why the sauce was weak? ?Found myself adding soy sauce and sesame oil to boost the flavors.

This hole in the wall is not known for its steamed caged pork buns, but it certainly makes up for it with its sample of Taiwanese dishes. ?The oyster omelette has a bit too much starch and too few oysters, but I still like it. ?They also have stinky tofu and a hearty beef tendon noodle soup with thick "kew2 kew2" noodles in a broth that can accommodate your tolerance for spiciness. ?With ample portions of tasty good eats and reasonable prices, I couldn't ask for anything more. ?Don't expect much for the decor or service, but it's a solid place for flavors that make me think of mom's home cooking. ?Basically, this is a good deal for cheap authentic eats that is worth checking out.

There have been couple experiences that I could taste the sourness of the appetizer we ordered, and can smell it is going bad, soon when we get home and open the box. ?

I first learned about Queen's House when I was contracting for a startup and it was on the small list of local restaurants we could order take-out from while staying within our individual daily lunch budget. This place is just so damn cheap that I'm always inclined to forget how average the food is - which is not to say that it's terrible, because it's not, but as a Taiwanese Asian who's had plenty of great dining experiences, I regard Queen's House as one step above home cooking. Still, the portions are generous and you never have to wait long before the food arrives, so I find myself continuing to visit again and again.

3.5 stars but would definitely make it a point to come back again. spicy beef noodle soup was great. the broth was a perfect amount of spice and the hand made noodles were freaking delicious. i only wish the beef was more lean. it was super tender but also really fatty. overall it did wonders for our hangover. scallion pancakes were also pretty good. a lot crispier than i've had and on par with the taste.

Extremely authentic Chinese food. One of my favorite places and my family's favorite places to eat for dinner, due to the savory tastes and the very reasonable prices (3 dishes/ $19.99). My favorite is the 3-cup tofu and the pepper fried fish fillets. Service is what you'd get at most Chinese restaurants, and the wait for your order is short.

FYI.. the 3 dishes for 19.99 went up to 3 for 21.99.. still a pretty good deal for castro dining.. we did the 3 for 21.99 and got normal greasy chinese food.. salt n' pepper spare ribs, sweet n' sour pork, and green beans.. ?everything tasted fine, but nothing was memorable.. ?the service wasn't bad - you are eating in a little chinese restaurant.. i'm not expecting 5 star service.. ?food came out quick, and so did our bill.. i'll probably return but will most likely skip the 3 for 21.99 meal and do the beef noodle soup.. ?it looked really tasty.. ?i also want to try the taiwansese stewed menu and dim sum.. ?so maybe this review will change.. ?who knows.. i think if you go in w/o high expectations, you'll be fine.. but don't expect anything fancy.. ?bcs you'll be greatly disappointed.. ?the place is really tiny and can probably seat 30 at best..

I like this place. Very decent Taiwanese/Chinese food for less than $10 per person even for dinner. I have been to this restaurant more than 20 times for dinner in the past 3 years and have always been served decent-tasting, freshly-cooked, authentic-looking Chinese food. Service is as good as you'll get in a Chinese restaurant looking to maximize sales per square foot.

I don't know what the talk is on YELP about how great this place is. ?I waited nearly 30 minutes for a table expecting something great since it was raved about on Yelp and also because it was busy of course. ?I go in and order the plate that NO decent chinese restaurant would mess up on: CHOW MEIN and they made it so GROSS that I couldn't eat all of it and didn't even pack it up to go and I always pack my food usually to go. ?I mean think about it if it wasn't good there it would NOT be good when I reheated the thing I had around 50% left over as well. ?I know good chinese food and I don't believe that a nice chinese restaurant would mess up on such a straight forward dish..unless the food there sucks all together. ?I would not ever go there again and if you want yucky food or can tolerate bad food this is the place for you even though I have no clue what the raves are about.

I am so lucky to live within walking distance of the best Chinese (oh, I mean Taiwanese) food I have found. It's a hole-in-the wall -- the storefront is so small, it's easy to walk right past it and miss it. You don't come here for the atmosphere, or friendly service. You come here for the cheap, good food. My recommendations: Northern-style scallion cake, the noodle soups, black mushrooms with Chinese greens, and sesame chicken. I ate dim sum here once on the weekend, and that was really good, too. Oh, and if you want a pearl tea drink (I like the lychee flavor) with your meal, they'll run next door to Tea Era and add it to your bill.

This place has some of the best noodle soups in the area. ?I usually order the beef stew noodle soup or the spicy beef noodle soup. ?The noodles are cooked perfectly with the right amount of chew and portions are large. ?The service is hit or miss but for $6 bowl of noodles it's well worth it. ?Definitely somewhere I'd go to again for a quick noodle fix.

We tried Salt & Pepper Fish Fillet, 3 Cup Chicken, Taiwanstewed shreded pork rice bow. 3 cup chicken lacking of 3 cups' source favor, just soy source paste flavor. shreded prk rice bow didnot have Taiwan's favor. Salt % pepper fish not much fish fillet, batter heavy, not crunch and very salty. Well, this place is good at beef noodle soup , spicy noodle.soup, forget about other dishes.

My favorite. Yes, they are rude and it's too crowded, but what do you expect for cheap Chinese?? My go to meal is the Beef Noodle Soup and the northern style scallion cake. Please don't come here expecting "American" Chinese. The sweet and sour pork, and other usuals aren't good. Stick with what the Asians order and you'll be fine.

since this was my first chinese food experience in norcal, this restaurant has a very special place in my heart. i remember it as having authentic chinese food and being very crowded. just like china. it does offer some healthy competition to chef liu's across the street. i recommend their clay pot dishes. prices were reasonable ($10 per a person).

Ordered takeout from here a while ago. Don't remember too much other than the overall feeling that the food not being too bad. Although I clearly remember the itchiness and throbbing my hands experienced later in the night. It was uncomfortable enough to interrupt my sleep. I've never experienced anything like that before.

I used to work with a Taiwanese guy that loved this place. It's hit or miss depending on your dish, so if you're not Taiwanese it could be like playing Russian Roulette. The service is brisk and passable. The place is literally a closet. This place and the joint to the left next door don't even equal one full establishment in most cases. So the wait can be long if there's more than 15 people here. I suggest bringing a Taiwanese national if you want to optimize your experience. Oh yeah they're closed on Tuesdays which is odd for retaurant closures.

Home cooked flavored Chinese food at a great value. The food isn't the best I've ever had, but for the price you just can't beat it. More of a day to day restauant to fill your tummy rather than a place to get a real treat. Definitely recommended though. This is the closest thing in the Peninsula to something you'd find in say Rowland Heights or Monterey Park in S. Cal where good cheap chinese food is always available.

**edit** i don't come here anymore. i think it has something to do with walking through the pretty gross kitchen to use the restroom. after viewing the kitchen, it's hard to wanna eat here again..... My top pick for Taiwanese food in Mountain View (oh , I miss Taiwan!). This place is a good deal for sure. For about $20, you can order 3 entrees and get rice or the scallion cake. Pretty good deal for a complete dinner. The scallion cake is good, but they really don't put enough scallions in them I think. I had their beef noodle soup before too and I though it was mediocre. I'll have to try it again though since their noodles are homemade.

This place was good like 4 or 5 years ago in terms of food and service. ?Back then, I came here every few weeks to eat with my father and brother. ?They had good service and we didn't have to wait a long time to get a waitress' attention. ?Their food was good,too. ?I stopped going for awhile then came back last year. ?The Beef Stew Noodle Soup and Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup wasn't good last year so I waited awhile again and came back today (6/14/08). I came here with my brother and I already knew this place would be crowded during lunch time. ?We waited probably 10 or 15 minutes to get a table. ?That's pretty typical during the lunch time. ?The redecorated this place from the last time I've been here. ?They have those couch-like seats against the wall so there is only 1 walkway instead of 2 walkways through the middle of the restaurant. ? When we finally got our seats, they gave us our napkins, spoons, chopsticks, and cups of water. ?They never gave us water before when we came to sit. ?Before, we would have to TRY to ask them to get water and chances are they never remembered to. ?Anyways, we looked through the menu and decided on the Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup. ?We probably waited around 10 minutes before we had to wave at somebody to take our order. ?It seemed like they ignored us. ?Usually, the waitresses or waiters would ask if we were ready to order but not this time. The Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup tasted better than it did last year. ?It tasted more or less the same as it did 4 or 5 years ago. ?Once we finished eating, we tried to get somebody to notice us to get our check. ?The older woman working there looked towards our direction. ?I knew she saw us but it seemed like she was trying to avoid bringing our check or even serving us. ?When she came to deliver food to another table and came back towards the cash register area, we waved at her again but she was looking down. ?Another waitress walked by and I got her attention. ?She acknowledged that we wanted our check and what did she do? ?She went take another table's order and that table was next to our table. ?I think she should have got our check and given it to us before taking the other table's order. ?It was really frustrating so I finally waved at the older woman like crazy and she FINALLY brought us our check. Their food was more or less the same over the years. ?However, their service has declined over the years. ?I don't think I'm going to come back for a long time.

I'm not sure why I should bother reviewing this place when it already has so many reviews! But honestly, what brought me here were the pictures (oh, and of course a friend's invitation). I had to try the Taiwanese stewed pork over rice, and the green onion pancake. Both were absolutely delicious. Even though I'm not a fan of fatty pork, it was still relatively lean. The pancake was nice and thin, and perfectly cripsy. We also ordered the fried pork chop over rice.... not so good.... Very thin, and tasted a bit sour even. Since we arrived late, our friends already got a table, but it was packed when we got there, and there was a long line at 8pm on a Friday night. They ordered pea sprouts, the layered pancake, and the three cup chicken. I only tried part of their pea sprouts, and pancake, both decent. I didn't try the chicken, but I heard it was too bony and small. Service was okay, not great, but not bad either. Parking was a bit difficult to find on the street, but we got lucky and only had to walk less than a block.

Can you give no stars?? I guess I have to give at least 1 star and that's doing this place a favor if you ask me. I've been here three times (all though I don't really know why). I only ordered the hot and sour soup the first two times and it was fine, exactly what I expected and not expensive. The last time I came (and I mean LAST), I sat down to eat a full meal. I actually recommended the place to them and I am SO embarassed now after our experience. Sat down and ordered our food, so far so good. Had to ASK for something to drink - C'MON! It's a Chinese restaurant, the tea/water shoulda come as we were sitting! Our server (if you can even call her that) only came back to refill our water when we asked her to and didn't even fill up everyone's glass! Did we need to tell her to fill up ALL the glasses??? It wasn't even busy. The food SUCKED. I ordered wonton soup - terrible. They tasted old! But I am spoiled by my mom's Chinese cooking....anyways, my friends ordered your other typical dishes, they were mediocre at best. Nothing special. Almost done (thank god). Tallied up our bill, $44...not bad, whatever. Let's just pay and get this over with. Send the credit card. Bill comes back.....$49?!! WTF? The server added $5 to our bill and thought we weren't going to notice?? We immediately bring it to her attention, she just looked at it and went to fix it.....she knew she got caught. No apologies either. We left a $1 tip, can't leave no tip otherwise the dumbass would think we forgot. Oh yah, my boyfriend got sick that night.....looks like they load up on the MSG. If you like bad service, shitty food, shitloads of MSG......this is your place! Long story short, NEVER going back. What a waste of time/money.

This is one of my favorite Taiwanese restaurants! A bit far but totally worth the drive. Well, it's not THAT far... maybe 20 mins away. I live for their noodle soups and their simmered noodles. Apparently, simmered food is very popular in Taiwan so getting a taste of Taiwan here is magical. The food is very tasty, big portioned and affordable. I see them hand make their dumplings every time I come here so I know it's "authentic". Every time I come here, this place is pretty packed... it is a very small place that fits maybe about 20 families at most. When I'm feeling super hungry, I would order the 3 dishes for $21 (or $23) or something like that and was never disappointed. I had the basil chicken, general tso (i know! who orders that!?) and one veggie dish. I have had the beef noodle soup, popcorn chicken, soymilk and other things I can't remember but everything I had was suburb and above average. Cons: The service is horrendous. They are impatient and mean to their non native speakers. LAME.

I wasn't sure if this place was Taiwanese or Mandarin. ?Regardless, I thought the beef noodle I ordered was mediocre at best. ?The soup tasted good at first but became tiresome after 5 minutes. ?Well, I'll have to say that they are generous in the amount of noodles and broth they give you. ?I wouldn't mind trying this place again since I may have picked the wrong item the first time. ?Heck, this place is packed with Asian people almost everyday during lunch hours which has to say something!

The food was pretty tasty. The service was alright. We ordered the northern style scallion cake, the crispy chicken with garlic sauce, black pepper beef with onions, and crispy pan fried noodles.

Lousy food for a fairly low price. Our food came out way too fast, and tasted like it had been reheated. The broccoli was bad, while the mu shu chicken was decent. It came to $28 for 3 people. They don't give fortune cookies, which irked me a little bit. I don't think recommend that anyone go here - if you're giving this place 4 or 5 stars, you need to get out a bit more.

The signature dish of Queen's House is their Taiwanese-style Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup, and it gets at least 4 stars for this dish alone. I prefer mine as the combo Beef & Tendon, and get the "fat" noodles rather than the traditional thin ones (which are a bit like udon but not as tasty), or simply replace the set with rice noodles instead. I've tried a number of other dishes here, but other than one or two very Taiwanese items everything else seems... well, average. And, very greasy. For the lack of luster the majority of the menu posesses, I'd call this a 3 star.

We still go here (or pick up take-out) every once in a while. I will say that it's definitely gone downhill. The prices have gone up (maybe due to the "remodel" they did last year?) and our favorites just aren't as tasty as they used to be. Also, my favorite (wor wonton soup) is no longer on the 3-dishes menu! Chef Liu across the street is a bit more expensive, but the service is better and so is the food. My $.02.

You can order drinks with your meal and they will bring it over (from Tea Era...I'm guessing it's the same owner) - their milk tea is really good. But other than that, I don't think I'd go out of my way to come back here.

When I was thinking how to rate this I was between a 3 and a 4. They have great service and our food came out hot and fast. The food tasted pretty good, though on one of the dishes the use of thicker noodles didn't allow for the spices to absorb enough. ?A thinner noodle may have worked better. ?The calamari, tofu, kung pao, mongolian beef and egg rolls all filled our stomachs well. ?

you definitely get your $$$'s worth here, but the food tastes average, & the service is a little off. they have this special where you order 3 dinner plates from the special menu + scallion pancakes OR rice for $19.99! ?it amounts to $21.64 after tax. my boyfriend & i shared the salt & pepper fish filet, pork with garlic sauce, & general tso's tofu. note: pork with garlic sauce is actually tiny pieces of pork stir-fried in a sauce with bamboo shoots... NOT a full sliced piece of pork to our disappointment. the food was alright, nothing to rave about, & the workers were too busy giggling & talking to each other rather than tending to their customer's needs, which was quite annoying. but there were leftovers because it was a CRAPPALOTTA food.

This is a small Taiwanese restaurant and is very busy during lunch, where you may have to wait a bit before getting seated if you come during the lunch prime time (12-1). They are known for the spicy beef noodle soup, which I don't care for. ?I'm a huge fan for the rice dishes and this is a personal preference. But I do like the soup with the deep fried pork chops on the side, which is tasty, when I'm in the mood for hot soup. But back to the rice dishes; you will get a 1 page menu where you can order a family style of 3 different dishes and get steam rice to share for a packaged price of $21.99, use to be $17.99 in the early 2000s, so that should tell you how long I have been loyal to this establishment. ?This easy menu of basic Taiwanese dishes really reminds me of eating traditional Chinese meal at home with my family. I normally always order the Dry Cooked String Beans (rated as spicy, but it is not that spicy) and Three Cup Tofu with the 3rd dish being something I have my eating partner decide on, which will be a meat dish. Now, one thing for sure, I am not vegetarian, in fact, I am the biggest meat eater ever, so it takes something quite flavorful to make me always want to order these vegetables. The key in ordering these 3 dishes is to have a balance of dry dish, salty dish, sweet dish and gravy type dish . You can choose your own combination, but let's just say that having 3 sweet dishes, you will be overwhelmed and won't enjoy the 3 combinations. So be warned and choose wisely! :) This would have been 5 stars, but I rate the service 3 stars, as I expect being a SMALL place, the server to be aware of your steam rice level and beverage levels and most important, knowing when you are done, cause it sucks having to wave down or having to walk to the counter to pay. ?So the 4 star rating, I recommend going if you are looking for good Taiwanese food, but to most people, Chinese food. ? If you find that you are in the mood for boba tea, they also own the Tea Era place next door and you can order your drinks in the restaurant or head over after your meal and get a Jasmine Milk Tea with pearls, which is my tradition of having when i am there.

this is a review of the thick pork soup only was on my quest for "petals of pork soup" (what they call this soup at Taiwan restaurant in SF) the soup was good, but I wonder if it was b/c they had minced garlic all over. must have gotten like 5 bits of garlic per spoonful. They served it crazy hot, which was painful for hungry me. I couldn't wait for it to cool anyway, the pork that is covered with fish paste was not tasting like I like it. too fishy. not meaty? the noodles were good, they they were stingy on the noodles. Giant bowl though. had enough soup to take home. prefer Taiwan restaurant in SF better for this Taiwanese pork soup--- aka bah genh in Taiwanese *please forgive the bastardization of the name*

I LOVE this place for their Spicy Beef Noodle Soup! I usually come here for lunch and that is all I order either with tendon or tendon and beef...but I have also tried their family style rice plates during lunch when I come with a few more of my co-workers. There's a black bean fish dish that is really yummy, shredded sweet and spicy pork is also really good. The bean sprout dish...also really good! Good price! It's a small place so can get pretty busy during lunch.

I really love the Wor Wonton Noodle soup here. I'm hooked and find it hard to order anything else. Great on a cold day. Noodles, wonton, veggies and the slices of beef and chicken are so good in this soup! The place always fills up for lunch. Not quite 5 stars because of the seating arrangement which requires squeezing in on a long upholstered bench setup. When it gets crowded it's hard to squeeze in there.

The food is good here, we had a deep-friend pork chop, dry-cooked string beans, tan tan noodles, and beef noodle soup. The house-made noodles really stood out, nicely chewy and soft. ?The pork chop was a treat too, very tender meat with no gristle or weird bits. Portions are generous and the price is low. ?Service was fine, no one was fussing over us, but we had everything we needed. ?The restaurant is pretty small with no real decor to speak of, and to get to the bathroom, you have to walk through the busy kitchen. ?Definitely one of the better Chinese options on Castro St., if you don't mind a bare-bones atmosphere.

This "hole-in-the wall" ?serves pretty good food. I tried their "Tan Tan" Noodles (I like to try the same thing at different restaurant to compare). ?It's good, but different from other places. ?Probably because of their "house-made" noodles instead of a packaged one. ?

Ordered seafood clay-pot, chicken cashew, and shrimp with black bean sauce. The most of the clay-pot was dry and the chicken cashew had peanuts instead of cashews. The shrimp with black bean sauce was ok, but the sauce was watery and there was not a lot of black beans. The owners did give us a refund on the "cashew" chicken and appologize, so that was reasuring. But we aren't planning on going again. We will stick to Cafe Yulong around the corner.

Came here for dinner thinking that it might be a good idea since there were so many people in the place. ?We were wrong! ?We were lured in by the 3 dish special w/ rice or scallion cakes for $21.99. ?The food was old, not flavorful, and was just poorly cooked We had the following dishes: Fish with Black Bean Sauce- A classic that was totally ruined by their old fish and poor cooking. ?It didn't even the usual black bean sauce. Chicken w/ String Beans - Another basic dish that was screwed up by old chicken and too much salt. Beef Clay Pot - Beef was tough and really didn't have much flavor. And on top of the bad food it made us feel ill afterwards. Save your money and stay away from this place!!!

we ordered: string beans 3cup chicken in clay pot beef noodle soup braised beef over rice 2.5stars, but knocked down to 2stars because the beef noodle soup was just that terrible! Who are these people that are saying their beef noodle soup is good/excellent...it is absolutely terrible! I couldn't even finish the little bowl I scooped for myself. The soup was water down, it didn't have any beefy flavor, and it had a weird sweet after taste. eck. 3cup chicken was ok. It almost got the flavors right but it was way too sweet! it needed more basil/garlic flavor... plus the sauce is not suppose to be so thick! braised beef over rice was just ok too... a little too sweet for my taste. actually the string beans also had a sweet sauce! Queen's House needs to lay off on the sugar! Taiwanese food is not suppose to be sweet!!

Start at 3 stars as a baseline, -1 for the food. ?-1 for the service. ?never had such an "interesting" experience before! ?so my hubby and i went on a weekday for late lunch. i ordered only a dish cuz my hubby already had lunch and not hungry. waiter asked if my hubby needs to eat. i explained he's not hungry. ?the ridiculous thing happened! ?he took away his utensil set! ?then the rice came and i asked for 2 bowls just to confirm why he's doing that. ?that waiter said there's a minimum of $6 per person on the bottom of menu and that's why he asked if my hubby is eating. ?sounds like it's my fault! ?ok, take a deep breath. ?even tho there's a min charge. ?but c'mon. ?there's no other customers around. ?can't you be nice to your only customer? ?of course i can easily add another dish, but i don't want to give any more $ to this business. so my hubby saw me eating the whole time and we joked about this together to make our dining experience a little better! the 2 things that i don't feel comfortable/respected are: 1) waiter took away his chopsticks! 2) monitoring us while we are eating! ? fyi. he was hiding inside kitchen before we ordered! this is definitely not a good business practice. ?and the food wasn't even good! ?and i'm speaking as a native chinese. ?there's many better chinese restaurants around. i don't write reviews much but i feel obligated to share this experience with the yelpers!

I don't know what the guys giving it a 1 or 2 stars is thinking, but they're obviously not Taiwanese. =) ? I have to say that this is the BEST Taiwanese restaurant I've ever been to in the US. ?Note that I say "Taiwanese" and not "Chinese" not because I'm trying to distinguish the two entities in some nationalistic rant, but the food choices are quite different. ?Their Chinese food isn't really that good, in my opinion, but their Taiwanese menu is excellent. ?Make sure you order ONLY from the first page, and last three pages of the menu. ?The rest you can get much better at a good Chinese restaurant. ? Their top dishes: ? - minced pork over rice (the closest thing to what you can get in the States compared to Taiwan), - Schezuan Beef Tendon Noodle Soup (the spicy style is tastier), ? - Won Ton over hot sauce appetizer (it's an improvement over the standard Chinese version, and I've never had it the way they make it anywhere else before!) The service is quick, the food is good, and the prices are cheap (though not as cheap as 5 years ago when I first found the place). Then go over to Tea Era for some of the best pearl teas in the business. =)

Small narrow place, gets busy for weekday lunches (more than 4 people would kinda suck) Surprisingly none of our three bowls of noodles came with the same noodles.. what gives Ok - beef noodle soup, the meat is very stewy tender, ok soup, the noodles were a bit too tough for me, thick Shanghai type noodles - snow cabbage and pork noodles So so - combo noodle (item #1), clear broth with pork and shrimp, gets no vote from my buddy - pork and chive dumplings, 12, who needs to eat that many? the skin is too thick, filling okay otherwise They kinda stole like $2 from us on the bill, I am not sure what happened but whatever (about $10 each)

Went back and ordered the same spicy beef and shrimp soup I'd been craving, except something went horribly wrong. The hot peppers were burnt. This totally ruined the whole flavor of the soup. Since these peppers were an integral part of my enjoying the soup the last time, I was really disappointed. I kept remembering the good taste from the time before. I am still craving it and will return for another round soon. I hope not to repeat this experience, or it may be my last visit. Bad MSG reaction again.

Came here on a Saturday because a friend said it is the best beef noodle place in the bay area. Really? His reviews are no longer trustworthy. We ordered a rice ball, 2 orders of beef noodle, oyster noodle soup, and a soy milk. The rice ball was meh, oyster noodle soup was bland, and the soup for the beef noodle was way too sweet and greasy. Noodle was not cooked enough, it's not supposed to be al dente okay? I obviously had a lot of leftover from the beef noodle as I didn't enjoy it that much, but being me and hating to waste food, I still had the leftover to go. But just the meat and tendon and a little bit of the soup. The funny thing is, when I heated it up later that night, it was delish!! It even made me wanna go back for more. This review would otherwise be 2 star, but I had to add an extra star for the leftovers. O and you can order directly from the boba place next door as they are own by the same family or something like that. It's a cheap and fast, might be back if I am in the area. Definitely NOT the best beef noodle in the bay.

It's simple. ?$6 for lunch, you just can't find that anymore in the area -- meals include soup, salad, main dish and choice of white/fried rice. ?True, it's difficult to get the waiter or waitresses' attention, but they are busy trying to shuffle people in and out. ?They are there to do volume to make money. ?The best way to do it is to grab a menu, quickly decide what you want to eat, tell them and just enjoy.

k and me love this place. whenever we're hungry and want to eat NOW. queen is always a go to option. if you go for dinner on a weekend, the wait may be a little long. maybe 15 minutes? but its definitely worth it. food service is quick and consistent. food comes out hot and the many times we've been. it always tastes just as good as the last. gotta admit the menu is difficult to learn at first. but after many times coming here our favorites are the spicy beef tendon noodle soup (4). careful spicy is REAL hot. sichuan food is no joke when is comes to spicy dishes. if you dont like tendons. just order beef noodle. also, the braised meatballs (4) dish is the bomb diggity. forgot what its exactly called, never seen this dish served anywhere else. chinese style meatballs with vegetables. you gotta try it. fire pot chicken (2) is ok. a lot of bones. not enough meat. almost like eating braised chicken feet. i think its more of the sucking and chewing of the flavor and bits that ppl like. not for me. pot stickers (3) are decent. a little trick to make them taste better. order them to go. fry them in a pan w/ a tiny bit of oil. they get crispy and crunchy. exponentially better.

Food is great. ?Wait can be a problem, especially on weekends. ?Most everything I've eaten here has been "above average" and some things have been great. ?Only one bad miss, which was last week - Chicken and Black Bean sauce lunch special was almost inedible - made with some less attractive dark meat parts that were chewy and sinewy and slimy. ?I threw it away.

It is hard to find a good Taiwanese deli restaurant in the Bay Area. ?So, I was really excited when I found this place. ?But, I am pretty disappointed. ?The food looked like Taiwanese, but didn't taste like Taiwanese. ?I rather drive to Cupertino for better ones. ?For those Taiwanese deli lovers, if you are ever in socal, gotta try Simbabla in Arcadia. ?It is the best one I had in the US. ?Their other establishment in Rowland Heights is not as good. ?Arcadia is worth of the drive and you could have Ding Tai Fung next door for dinner!

4.5 stars pretty surprised to see not-so-good reviews here! food is very good, seems authentic, good mom-and-pop chinese vibe. ? plenty of chinese customers, always a good sign. the chicken with black bean sauce is amazing and refreshing. it comes with four tortillas/pancakes and the black bean sauce on the side. might want to request more of the black bean sauce cuz its goood. the mushu pork is good too, but there are a lot more interesting dishes to try. ?the soupy dishes are sort of hit or miss IMO. they give you ridiculously large servings of rice so maybe order short of what you usually would elsewhere... seating for groups bigger than 4 may be tough during peak hours...

Avoid at all costs! This is a "hole-in-the-wall" type of place. Meaning it's small, dirty, bad lighting and bad service. I am OK with these types of places if the food makes up for the lack everything else. It didn't. The food was so bad I had to send it back to the kitchen. The 2 others at my table agreed that their food was also really bad. I understand you are not going to get great service at a cheap Chinese joint at lunch, but this was ridiculous. The server was being severed himself and having lunch. I had to turn around and wave him over to get a drink and again to tell him how awful the food was. I will never go back.

Consistent, hearty home cooking style Chinese food. Like any authentic Chinese restaurant, expect minimal contact and service, but just be ready to scarf down the food as they bring it out to you all at once or one right after the other, depending upon how busy they are. Small place, so get there early or be ready to sign up on the wait list. This is not mind-blowing, to-die-for Chinese food, but food like your relatives or parents would make. Their three dishes for $23 or $25ish dinner will fill a party of four and possibly some for leftovers too.

Went to lunch at Queens House on Castro Street. We ordered the pork & leek water dumplings, black bean/ tofu dry noodles (zah-jiang mien), green onion pancake, and the stir-fried dried long beans. The dumplings were very tasty. Large meat filling that was juicy but not oily. The skin was a bit thicker than I like, but that didn't stop me from eating 6 of them. My favorite dish was the black bean noodles. The sauce was served over a huge bowl of thick noodles, but there was plenty of sauce to cover it all. The sauce was more chinese-style (as opposed to the dark black korean style zah-jian mien), just the way I like it. It had minced pork, diced tofu, onions, and even some bamboo. Absolute perfection. The only other place I found comparable was at Shan Dong in Oakland and now I've found a closer place to me. I am thrilled! The fried green onion pancake was mediocre, a bit too oily and not salty enough (A&J still tops my list for that). Same goes for the dried long beans- didn't seem like they cooked it long enough, but it's healthier here. The table next to us had ordered the minced pork and soy egg over rice and it smelled delicous. I plan to try that next time. I will be back!

I went there last weekend, surprisingly, it was not crowded. I have been wanting to go there since I have been dying to try one of their noodle soup. ?While their soup base was great (a little bit sweet though), but the noodles were poorly made. ?Maybe I'm too sensitive, but I think its b/c the kind of flour they use to make their noodle - smells like corn flour - which is not authentic at all. ?Probably will not go back.

Good food, average service. Their dumplings are simply the best. They also have a pretty authentic selection of Taiwanese and Chinese delicacies. The food quality is pretty good. Don't go in expecting yet another chow mein and broccoli beef joint, because Queen's is not an average Chinese restaurant. The down side is, everyone is so busy in there. They barely have time for you. When they do have time, they make sure they get you what you asked for, so it is not "rude" service, just bad because you have to wave at a waiter many times to get their attention. The spicy beef noodle soup is probably the BEST in the south Bay Area. The dumplings are so good, we often buy big frozen bags of them to cook at home (yes they sell dumplings in bulk). If you are adventuresome, try (my favorite dish) the stirr fried pork intestines with pickled cabbage. Yup, you get the jist of it, this restaurant is for authentic Chinese food.

the beef noodle soup is pretty good, but for the rest of the mainline dishes, they are so-so. What makes me give such a low rating is really the bad customer service. ?Our tea ran out, we flipped open the top of the tea pot (a signal for them to refill it). ?All 4/5 of the waiters/waitresses who were waiting by us deliberately chose to ignore us. ?I definitely saw them caught a glimpse of the tea pot, but chose to ignore us. ?C'mon, we just want to sip one more round of tea before we leave. ?I think they just force you to leave instead of giving u more tea, as others say, this place is small, so always quite crowded and cramped.

Been coming here for 12 years . ?Prices have crept up (still very reasonable) and every remodel brings cleaner tables and chairs. This place is one of the most authentic Taiwanese cuisine places in the bay area. ?Signature dishes include Beef Noodle Soup, Stewed and Chopped Pork over rice, Three Cups Chicken, and Spicy Wontons with Peanut sauce. ? You gotta know what to expect when walking in the door. ?The wait can be long, the head chef must be deaf since he screams louder than Gordan Ramsey and have no taste buds since dishes have gotten saltier over time....cough..msg...cough. ?There are buckets of stewed beef and pork on the ground in the kitchen and they don't score too high with the health and safety inspections but this is all worth it to get authentic Taiwanese dishes that are oohh so tasty.

This place is great if you appreciate homemade dumplings and thick and chewy noodles. If not, I don't think this is the place for you.

In all the years I've eaten at Queen's House, I always get the same thing...the Schezuan Beef Noodle soup. There's generous portions of beef, noodles and veggies. And the beef isn't your typical braised beef nugget like other places, we're talking about a huge chunk of cow with the tendons attached and chewy enough that you're guaranteed to get some stuck in between your teeth...bring floss. The best part is the broth, never eat a mouthful without some broth. The noodles are nothing to write home about, but they're passable. Not a fan of the seating in there, you're literally rubbing elbows with the strangers one table over. Service could be better but let's not kid ourselves, it's a Chinese restaurant.

Mediocre dumplings - they are kind of sweet and I'm not sure what the meat in them is. The Taiwanese minced pork rice was delicious. However, overall it was a poor value - I'm sort of dreading eating the leftover dumplings, which is never a good sign... My lunch companion only ate a quarter of his beef soup noodles, and didn't take home the leftovers, for what that's worth.

The place alone is very tiny and not very clean, but the food, or I should say the beef noodle soup is definitely worth 5 stars. ?I used to work in Palo Alto and I would go there maybe once every two weeks or so whenever I can sneak out for a long lunch. ?The place, however, has gone up in pricing, but you can't beat a bowl of steaming hot noodle soup for 5-6 bucks. ?Definitely a great lunch spots for those who are on a budget. ?Over look the dirtiness and slow service, this place is worth a shot.

I'm a vegetarian. There are about 6 great tofu options here of which my favorites are General's Tofu ?and Braised Tofu. Kung Pao Tofu is pretty good too. The Chow Mein dish are great. I've tried the eggplant with garlic sauce and it was pretty good (no the best I"ve had, but good). Kim Chee Noodle soup is very spicy - so be careful. It is tasty. On weekends you can get the Chinese donut, which isn't sweet, but very tasty. It's a hole-in-the-wall type of place and is very small. Service is acceptable. Overall, best chinese in Mountain View for vegetarians mainly because of the great tofu dishes and the number of vegetarian options on the menu.

Absoluteley terrible. ?Went there on St. Patricks Day '08 (I guess that makes me pretty weird, but anyway). ?Restaurant was pretty crowded, and it took about 20 mins for the waitress to come take our order. She was incredibly rude, which could have been easily forgiven if the food had been somewhat delicious. It was not. Noodles FAIL. Waitress FAIL.

Many of you do not know, but they make their own vegetarian dumplings. So, if you're vegetarian and you would like to try it, call them beforehand. They may make it for you that day, so you can eat it at the restaurant. Or, maybe you can take a bunch of freshly made ones to place in your freezer. Since my mom is vegetarian, she loves stopping by at this place to eat their vegetarian dumplings when she visits from Hawaii. But, I love this place for two dishes. I would order more if I could. So, this time around, not with my mom, but a friend, we ate here. My favorite two dishes are the za jia min (noodles with black bean paste with tofu, cucumbers, grounded meat, and onions) and the o-ya-jin (oyster pancake). You wonder why this za jia min is so special because it's not the typical Chinese and/or Korean black bean paste. It has a very distinctive taste. The sauce is not dark, it's light. You can see and taste all the ingredients in your noodles. This is why I order it every single time I come here! If I see the o-ya-jin on any Taiwanese menu, I usually order it. There are some other variations to this Taiwanese dim sum dish, like adding other vegetables into the pancake or a different sauce to it. By far, this is still the best one I love eating! My friend ordered the spicy beef noodle soup. Wow, I am impressed with this spicy beef noodle soup. It had large amounts of beef and a good size amount of noodles. So speaking of large portions, of course, two tiny girls couldn't finish these noodles. But, two things for certain, the o-ya-jin was gone and we loved the food there!

Queen House in downtown Mountain View is without doubt one of my favorite (moderately) cheap Chinese/Taiwanese restaurants in the Bay Area. The place doesn't look like much, but the food is delicious! They have a special in the evening, where you can order three entrees (from a limited selection) for about $18 total including either rice or scallion pancakes... I've tried quite a few items on the menu, but I really really love the salt and pepper fish (deep fried fish that comes with onions and peppers). I also really enjoy the three-cup tofu, which is a typical Taiwanese dish (or its variant the three-cup chicken, not on the special menu but you can order it as part of the special deal nonetheless). The three-cup tofu is this fried tofu which comes with lots and lots of basil, garlic and ginger in a sweet soy sauce... yum! Their soups are pretty good too. I miss it so much now that I'm in NY!!!

Ive been here for dinner once and lunch about ten times, so I def recommend it! The lines are long tho esp during the lunch hour rush so be prepared to wait and if you have a big group dont expect to get seated right away. I usually go with the same two coworkers and they are big guys and strong eaters so we order a lot! Lunch entrees (about $5) each come with a bowl of sweet and sour spicy tofu soup, plate of really good salad, and your choice of steamed rice or fried rice. The three of us usually order five dishes and some gyoza as appetizers (comes with 8). We've had the sweet and sour shrimp, cashew chicken, broccoli beef and chicken (beef is better), stir fried vegetables, vegetable stir fry with shrimp, black bean chicken, string bean chicken, and mongolian beef. And we all have liked every single dish. The taste is always the same so we're not disapointed and they actually get the food out really quickly which is impressive bc there are never enough seats. So the fast service is good bc that means you dont have to wait as long. The only downside i can think of here is that they take forever to get you water or a refill, better just get up adn do it yourself or bring your own water bc you will be thirsty after all that food! But they do give you tea and the bill has always come out to about 20 bucks which is not bad for how much we eat and for three people. Dinner is good too, except no soup and salad and the portions are a big bigger and a little more expensive.Still good tho, its my favorite chinese restaurant =)

We ordered pea sprouts, salt and pepper fish and the 3 cup tofu clay pot dish and they were all pretty good. I will be back again to try their beef noodle soup.

You can't find too many places that have hand pulled noodle in the US. ?They have awesome spicy beef noodle soup. ?Pork chop is also very good.

Very tasty beef noodle soup. It was a bit oily but I like it that way. You don't keep here to eat healthy so it is expected. Can't wait to go back.

was here for lunch. place was PACKED. apparently they are known for their beef noodles.-- 5.99 for a huge bowl. i had the beef w/ tendon bowl for 6.99, very good soup base. only neg is the noodles are a little too hard for my taste. ?service was also fast, you'll be able to get your stuff in under 5 min. would definitely drop by again for the noodles. they do have a min of $5 per person.

Sweet and sour shrimp and shredded pork fried rice. The shrimp wasn't good, almost depressing. Fried rice was ok, good enough where I'd consider trying this place again, but definitely not recommendable.

take the lou rou fan (stewed meat rice, see picture) TO GO to reap the benefits of a 2X larger portion than if you ordered in. on top of that, there's literally no wait (go straight in and place the order) and you can eat outside where it's less cramped!

came here for lunch yesterday. ?since it was a pretty cold day, i figured i would get some soup. ?i ordered the beef stew noodle soup, medium spicy. ?the portions were huge, and my bowl was filled to the top. ?the noodles were a little too thick and hard for my own taste. ?the beef was good, but a little bit too fatty. ?the flavor of the soup was tasty and overall a pretty good bowl of soup. ?with our group of 7, it seemed like the food was a bit hit and miss for everyone.

My wife and I come here maybe once a month. ?They have a good deal with 3 dishes plus rice or green onion pan cake for $20. ?We usually get that for take out. ?The food is really just average. ?We usually order stir fried pork or chicken dish, and usually with no surprises. ?This place is not the best place for Szechuan, Shanghai, mandrain, or Cantonese dishes, but some Taiwanese style dishes are nice. ?I like the Beef Noodle soup, but wife is not a fan of that dish.

Probably my favorite Chinese restaurant in MTV and maybe in all of South Bay. ?Why? ?Cheap (inexpensive), authentic and tasty dishes. ?I travel to China regularly (Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing) and have had a chance to eat at good restaurants when I travel. ?I like Queen House and I especially like the General's Chicken (they use white meat, which I like), Salt & Pepper fish, and the dumplings (order them first thing, as they take a while). ?Any of their noodle dishes and soup are also spectacular. ?It's my regular place to go for good, inexpensive Chinese food.

This Taiwanese restaurant is really close to a 5 for me (it might well be once I try it out a couple more times). We got 4 different dishes and shared it family-style. I loved the fried rice and the 3 cup chicken.

I come here mainly for the szechuan beef noodle soup. ?Other dishes I've tried include the pork with preserved vegetables noodle soup, tan tan noodles, black bean sauce noodles, scallion pancake and marinated pork spare ribs. ?All were very tasty. ?I ventured away from those to try their regular chinese dishes for dinner once and didn't enjoy it as much. ?So if I had to breakdown my review it would be 4 stars for the lunch type items and 2 stars for the dinner items. ?Keep in mind that this place can get pretty busy and there's a wait. ?Also they have rearranged their seating to accomodate more people so it can get pretty cramped in there.

Queen House is a favorite of mine for their soups. ?I have limited experience with the other items on the menu, but one of my favorite Queen House rituals is a weekend matinee at the Century Cinema 16 theatre, with a hot container of the Queen House Won Ton soup or Hot and Sour soup to quietly slurp throughout the film (carefully smuggled into the theatre in my daypack). ?Family owned, quick service, generally pleasant staff. ?Check it out! ?Worth a visit.

This restaurant serves pretty authentic Taiwanese dishes at affordable prices. The menu is pretty standard, and the food is consistently above average, but don't expect something extraordinary. Service is usually quick, wait times are short, and it's a good choice if you want some beef noodle soup.

Yummy Taiwanese food for a reasonable price. ?The spicy beef noodle soup, the black pepper ribs, three cups chicken & tofu, and the onion pancakes are good here along with several other dishes. ?The noodles dishes in general are good. ?Four stars instead of five, since their best dishes are really good, but if you order randomly, food will be mediocre.

Best Chinese noodle soup you can find. The spicy shrimp noodle soup is really excellent. And this is only for $6. The best place for lunch in Mountain View. Besides the noodle soups, the Chinese food is good but quite standard.

So I've been here a few times now and every time I've ordered the Szechuan beef tendon noodle soup. It doesn't matter that I haven't particularly cared for anything else I've tried on their menu because the beef tendon noodle soup will keep me coming for a long time. The soup is just spicy enough that you don't have to add any hot sauce yourself but not overwhelming. The tendons are cooked to be really tender and the noodles are thick and juicy. The portion size is so big that I can never finish a bowl myself. Like I said, nothing else I've tried is that good, but it's worth a visit just for that one dish. That being said, the green onion pancake is ok but it's not flaky enough, probably because it's slightly over-fried. It's worth getting a bubble tea drink there because they serve it from Tea Era which is pretty good. Be wary of long lines and don't bother coming on Tuesdays because it's closed. (I totally made that mistake and was pretty disappointed.)

i was so hopeful, TAIWANESE food and the wait is long at this place. ?i see no reason why now except perhaps the location of the restaurant. ?i ordered the special where you can pick 3 or 4 dishes for a set price. ?the choices sounded good, but they did not taste it, good that is. ?the dishware was DIRTY, maybe because of the high turnover rate. ?i understand i'm at an asian establishment, but when the last customers' dishes are discernible on your plate, i think there's a problem. ?the noodle soups at the other tables looked good, but i won't be trying them anytime soon.
