This place is great. Ribs are to die for. All of it is good. I live in the neighborhood; I go all the time and order pick-up. I've even given gift cards from here. Highlights are the meat of course, then there are the sauces (you get to pick from four--heaven!), and sides are all so good I'm always changing my mind. Baby Blues is my main BBQ when I don't cook it myself. I find myself reminded of Austin here. It's nice.

This place has gone way downhill... My friends and I use to go to this place ever so often due to the lack of great BBQ rib places in the city, and it was located near our work. ?We always enjoyed the beer and atmosphere but that soon changed. We went in on a Friday after work to celebrate a friends BDay. We ordered one of their most popular beers - they didn't have it. ?We ordered another popular beer - they didn't have it either. ?We then started with appetizers, ordered shrimp, and chicken wings. ?Guess what? ?They didn't have checking wings either, they were out of them. I mean, come on, really... you are out of your most popular items at 6pm on a friday? Isn't this supposed to be prime time?? Anyways, after appetizers we decided to cut our loses short and go somewhere else. ? The bbq ribs (from the previous times I had them) are okay for me, but my friend says they are disgusting, badly made and over cooked. Compare to other places, such as the one in the Haight, I would agree that the ribs here are subpar. Also, I've noticed a new waiter/waitress working here every other week. ?Seems like no one likes to stick around this place for too long. Not a good sign. Anyways, if you have money to burn and want to try a new place out, good luck to you. I definitely would not recommend this place for any special occasion. Nothing sucks more than wanting to have a great dining experience, specially when you are spending money, only to get really shitty results from a restaurant. We spent a lot of money on this place on previous occasions. ?We are taking our money somewhere else.

When Baby Blues first came to Bernal, there was a lot of anticipation and hype. ?Consequently, my first visit was somewhat of a disappointment, as I thought it was just OK; nothing special. I went back last night and had a more positive impression. ?The on-tap beer selection was very good and I got to choose between a rye and a double-rye with generous sample sizes and they were both good. ?The chicken wing appetizers were tender and delicious, in a unique way. ?I chose the Baby Blues salad as my side, which was excellent. ?(Note that the "small plates" are plenty big enough for dinner.) ? The main event: ?Pulled pork was good. ?Tried all four sauces and didn't care much for the hot ones... I liked the one in tallest dispenser best. ?The pork ribs were again, just OK. ?I think I expect those to be what a BBQ place is best at, but it's not for them. I'd go again, but I'm not rushing back.

My housemate ordered in from here and found herself with too much food, thus I graciously agreed to help out! I agree with the sentiment that BBQ is really subjective, but here we go: - creamed spinach. Oh boy. An earlier review called this "unconventional". You're looking at whole leaf spinach that hasn't been wilted, mixed with a white sauce. You will not recognize this as creamed spinach. That said, I thought this was nice and garlicky. - cornbread. I guess this was cold from being delivered, but the cornbread was kind of dry and crumbly. I've certainly had better. - brisket. Stringy and without much flavor. Slather on the BBQ sauce for this one. - ribs. Not very tender, but serviceable. Of these four items, I'd only consider the creamed spinach enjoyable if untraditional, and the rest mediocre. Since I can only speak about their delivery, maybe their food is better in the restaurant (certainly warmer!). This was pretty underwhelming.

I really wanted to be amazed by their BBQ, but I found it to be good, but not amazing. ?I've eaten here a few times and the service is sometimes very good, sometimes OK. ?The menu has a lot of variety to its BBQ options, lots of sauces and side options. ?The portions are good, but when I got my bill I simply didn't feel my experience was worth the cost. ? Baby Blues BBQ is a good place to go when you want to eat meat, drink, and watch a game with friends. ?The atmosphere is laid back, casual, without a lot of pretense - all good things.

After a couple of visits, this is hands down my favorite SF BBQ joint. I haven't had the ribs yet (BBQ sacrilege!), but I've had the beef brisket and the pork, and they were both great. Nice selection of sauces, and mostly excellent sides. The corn on the cob is amazing (not sure what they season it with), the mashed potatoes are good (as mashed potatoes always are), and the sweet potatoes and cream spinach are also solid. Mac and cheese is just meh, and the cornbread has been a bit hit or miss (but never bad). Bonus points for the great music that's been playing everytime I've been in here.

San Francisco may not be known for its barbecue, but this place is off the chain! Finger-lickin good. We came here for a friend's birthday party and left bursting at the seams. Everything here is good, but I highly recommend the pork spare ribs. The meat is succulent and falls right off the bone. Our friend also loved their chicken wings. As for the 'fixins', you have to go with the cornbread and collard greens. These fixins took our meal from good to great. We will definitely be back!

Best kids brunch in the city! The food is amazing: pork belly sliders, pulled pork Benedict...but the best part is the kids craft table filled with everything from clay handprint molds to bead necklaces and painting. SO much fun for kids - and parents get a little break while they eat. Great beers on tap, bottomless mimosas and sports on tv, can't go wrong.

I was reallye excited for the creamed spinach, but it was not what I was expecting at all. ?I would guess they just wilt/blanche spinach and add some heavy cream and seasonings, it was pretty watery when I prefer it to be thicker and less healthy seeming. ?Street parking was easy and close, but the surrounding streets are not well-lit.

I had a great experience today here. My boyfriend loves bbq and we were soooo over memphis minnies and there bad service, and ok food. We looked up bbq places in the city and decided to come here, I was a little nervous because he is very hard to please, but we were both very impressed. First off, the service was awesome, the owner was extremely personable. We started off with the shrimp which were awesome. The most important thing I want from a restaurant when I go out is that I want to be served food I cant make myself. These shrimp were incredible and I definitely cant replicate them. We also ordered the ribs, which were perfect. I loved that the mac n cheese and the baked beans and corn were variations of the traditional versions. We will be back!

First - BBQ is subjective, so take with a grain of salt. I had the sliced brisket (my test of good BBQ), baked beans, and cole slaw. Brisket was too salty for me, but good still. Beans were good after spiking with some of five different sauces (all distinct & quite good). Slaw was good - hard to mess that up. Everyone else had different things and everyone cleaned their plates, just like our moms taught us. That's a good sign. They pair beer with plates of food. Nice. Service was excellent. Atmosphere is basically what you'd expect for a city BBQ joint. Better, even.

This is my third or fourth time eating their BBQ, and there's been a long lag time between experiences. Tonight, I know why. Baby Blue BBQ ranges from very mediocre to not good. I'm annoyed that they do both pulled and sliced brisket and they don't even tell you the difference on the phone and they default to the pulled brisket which is very bland and somewhat tough. Don't get the pulled brisket--it will ruin your concept of brisket and bbq in general. The ribs are always a little bit too dry--all of the styles. Their bbq sauce is a highlight, some spicy, some sweet, not too vinegary. The sides here used to be my consolation for so-so meat, but the sides have definitely gone down hill. Not what they were a few years back when they opened. You can read it all in the previous reviews: The mac-n-cheese is soupy, the creamed spinach is very unconventional (in a bad way), the collard greens are standard but very average, the sweet potato mash has lost all flavor over the years and the cornbread is greasy with too much butter and dry pieces of corn. Overall, not a good place to eat, and I think I wil never eat from there again by choice. Too many great places to eat, to waste my time and money on this place. Let's face it, San Francisco just isn't a barbecue town and that's okay since I can make my own bbq if I really wanted it, or save my cravings for when I'm in a bbq town. Sorry Baby Blues, I'm done. No more!

How to have a Laborless Labor Day BBQ: 1) Go to http://eat24hours.com/ 2) Type in Baby Blues BBQ. 3) Order the "Memphis Queen" Platter (1/2 Baby Back Ribs, 1/2 Memphis Ribs for $27.95) and the "Bones and No Bones" Platter (1/2 Rack Memphis, 1/2 lb. pulled pork for $24.95). 4) Answer the door just 30 min. later. 5) Douse the slightly dry but flavorful ribs in tangy BBQ sauce and wonder why there is hardly any pulled pork. 6) Make a note to self for next time - yay tomatoe-y collard greens and cornbread; boo soupy overcooked "mac 'n cheese" and underdone "creamed spinach." 7) Next year resolve to be not *quite* as laborless and make the drive to Gorilla Barbeque instead.

I found myself needing a large group dining space, on relatively short notice on a Saturday night. And as is often the case with large groups, you don't know exactly how many people are going to show up. The day before the event (!) I was able to make a reservation for 20 people around a massive table with lots of stools, so we were easily able to handle fluctuations in headcount. The food was solid, the ambience was great, the service was good, and the prices were reasonable. They offer big family-style set-price selections of sides, meats, etc. Their suggested serving sizes are huge -- we ordered the platter designated for 16, and our group of ~22 couldn't finish everything -- so unless everyone is ravenous you can go down a size or two on the platter choices. Great choice for a last-minute large group dinner.

(Keep in mind that I am writing this review after having eaten my way through Kansas City BBQ so I may have unreasonably high expectations.) Several people have told me that there is no good BBQ in SF but that Baby Blues is one of the better places. ?I couldn't agree more. ?In fact, if Baby Blues was in KC they would only get 2 stars, but since we're in a smokehouse-deprived city, they get 3. The baby back ribs were not very tender and you had to gnaw to get the meat off the bone. ?It's hard to find "fall-off-the bone" in SF. ?The brisket was pulled, not sliced, and was kind of bland and tough. ?The pulled pork was average, not as good as Sneaky's (though I dislike Sneaky's for other reasons). ?In general, none of the meat was very smoky and you don't get that wonderful smoke ring or bark like you get in the Midwest. ?The collards were standard, the pork and beans were unconventional - basically beans topped with pulled pork instead of beans cooked together with chunks of pork for better flavor. ?The cornbread, however, was excellent - moist and finished on the grill, imparting some charred meaty flavor to the edges. ?Also, their sauces are pretty good, especially the spicy one! But the #1 thing I love about Baby Blues is that they have EXCELLENT SERVICE. ?Our server was kind and friendly, she wasn't irritated when I took forever to decide what to order, and once I finally made that decision, she immediately told us how she could ring up our order differently to save us a buck while still getting exactly the same food. ?Who else is ever going to tell you that??! ?We left her a very generous tip and she was very grateful. ?I think I'd return again just for such phenomenal service!

As far as BBQ goes, it's decent but not the best around. The brisket's pretty dank ("Dank"? I just morphed into a stoner, apparently), but it's pretty hard to screw that up. Also, high-top tables are the enemy of short people, and I always end up sitting at one. Dangling legs? What am I, a toddler? They do get props, however, for a few things: 1) They deliver. All. Day. I can't count how many times I ordered lunch delivery and was very content. 2) KOOL-AID! Need I say more? That stuff's delicious.

This is like the brother of the tomahawk from Alexander's (which is my fave topped w/ foie gras). The sides are delicious, but why fill up on sides? I came here to eat me some meat baby. The staff are very friendly and very helpful. If you have questions they take the time to answer them.

Best BBQ we've found in the city and we've definitely been searching. We came by for take-out at Baby Blues BBQ so that we could go back across the street to the El Rio bar. We decided on the "bones and no bones" which was a mixed platter with Memphis ribs and pulled pork. For our two sides, we choose the creamed spinach and the mac n' cheese. Overall, the pulled pork was hands down the best. It was oh-so-tender and well flavored. We particularly loved all the extra bbq sauces you could get- our favorites were the mild and the molasses sauces- both just a touch sweet and super yummy. The ribs were also good but unfortunately not the fall off the bone tender as we were hoping. The sides were flavorful as well with the mac n cheese made with a hint of bleu cheese and the creamed spinach both fresh and well seasoned. Add on some cornbread and were we satisfied! (@ ~$27 for 2 people) Needless to say, we were excited that we found BBQ that we liked in SF and will definitely be coming by again. If only they could make the meat a bit more tender, we might even bump this review to a five.

I think that this is the first bad review I've ever written for a restaurant! I live (house sitting) only a few blocks away and was starving for something flavorful, and meaty who could deliver. ?I was so excited that Baby Blues BBQ delivered as it was on my to try list. ?However, I ordered the baby back ribs with corn bread and cole slaw online with an estimated delivery time of 30 - 45 minutes....I waited almost an hour and a half (for 4 blocks) and when the delivery person came, it was dry, cold, hard ( and that was the baby back ribs), the corn bread was also cold and stale. The cole slaw was bitter. I was so disappointed. It takes alot for me to dislike food, believe me!. Maybe it was because it was a delivery?? I don't know if it's better dining there...but I am not going to waste my money again to find out.

I LOVE the vibe in here. And the beer list. And the crowd and the kids' corner and everything. It really bums me out that the food is just meh. I'm from the South and I love barbecue, but I'm not a snob either. So I'm reacting from a place of knowledge without being a prick about it I hope. I appreciate that they don't sauce things too much - but then again, a dry thin smear of pulled pork on a bun does not a satisfying pulled pork sandwich make. I've also had the chicken sandwich (yawn), and the wings (good, but room temperature - weird). Tonight I got the burger and it was awesome, actually, but not usually what you are thinking of having at a BBQ place. I'll go back, and try the brisket and the ribs, I'm sure, because, well, it's right there on the corner, but I'm just not impressed really. But I like it still. Okay.

We dropped in as group of 20 or so for a birthday dinner last weekend, having been allocated the left wall of the restaurant. To keep things simple, we went and ordered the largest party platter/dinner set available, and got corn bread, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, potato salad, and a few other fixins along with the meats. Overall, not bad. I wasn't a huge fan of the pulled pork and brisket, as they were both a bit lacking in flavor, and on the dry side of things (though I suppose that's what the four different types of BBQ sauce they have available on the table are for). And while I didn't get around to trying the chicken, the two types of ribs they had were pretty damn good, with some great flavor and tender to boot, easily making them the best part of the meal. I can't say much for the fixins though, as nothing really stood out. The corn bread was good enough, while the mac n cheese and mashed potatoes were okay, and the potato salad fairly lackluster. The decor of the place was neat - lacking better interior design terms to describe it, I'd have to say it reminded me of a barn. A trendy barn. All the light fixtures were actually made out of various rusted metal pails and cans, which I thought was a neat touch. If I remember correctly, the meal came out to a little under $20 a person. While most of what I tried there wasn't particularly noteworthy, the ribs are definitely worth trying out.

Have those who have been here ever had BBQ before??! Totally don't get how people are a fan of the food here. I've been spoiled by Memphis Minnie's and Gorilla BBQ and this place will be one that I'm definitely not coming back to. The pulled pork was cold upon arrival and didn't have any flavor. The cornbread was a really buttery, dense piece of blah. The creamed spinach was exactly "creamed spinach" as in spinach leaves mixed with cream. (I LOL-ed because I've never seen such a thing..almost like they were playing a joke on us). The mac and cheese was soupy. The baby back ribs were tender with just a HINT of flavor. Easy to imagine what their desserts taste like if their main food was so terrible. Um no.

This place is really great. I have dined in the restaurant as well as ordered in with their delivery numerous times. It's consistent, the food is great and the service is attentive... especially by the owner, who seems lovely. I usually get the beef brisket, the hot links (which I'm SO thrilled they decided to bring back!) and the ribs. All are served with the most delicious sauce... and really, when it come to bbq- it's all about the sauce, right? For the sides, I love the okra... it's always cooked just right (which means not over done!). My husband likes the cole slaw (me- not a fan of any cole slaw). I also love the banana pudding dessert- so yummy! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a meaty bbq experience.

In the UK, they used to (maybe still do, its been awhile) have this rule with serving pints - the head can't be below the bottom of the queen's crown on the british pint glass. ?a rule put in place to ensure that when you pay for a pint, you get a pint. ?or the rule with wine in the US where you can't call it estate unless 50% of the grapes were grown on your property. well, there needs to be a rule about calling grilled meat barbecue, because this is what this place doles out. ?there must be a lot of people who really can't tell the difference, which is really why barbecue is so poor here - anyone seems to be able to fake it and get away with it. i ordered the memphis pork ribs to go. ?i could see from the bar a guy put some meats onto a flame grill and saw the flame go up and down. ?i thought maybe a burger because they have that too. anyway, i don't look again until i get this package home and unwrap the foil around the ribs. ?it tasted completely like charcoal and required decent chewing to get the meat off the bone - no WAY i could pull anything off with my fingers. what kills me is that if you're going to fake it, there's far easier ways - spice rub and sauce, wrap in foil with broth and apple cider in closed package and cook under low heat in the oven for a couple hours. ?then transfer to a grill with heavy smoke for 20 minutes. ?it's an easy way to get it done in a pinch and would be 10 times better than this. who wants to start a campaign to eliminate fake barbecue?

The ribs were dry and the sides were bland. If you're from the South, you know this place ain't nothing special :) I'm going to keep trying. There's got to be someone around here who knows how to smoke the flesh of a mammals ribs to perfection. Unfortunately, it's not these folks.

My original three-star review was right when they opened three years ago. I've eaten here several times since then. I gave them the benefit of the doubt on the first trip (even though they ran out of food and only had a couple of things left to order) but I've seen enough. This place is simply not good and getting worse. *** Caveat: I am from Texas and I grew up eating BBQ *** Last night we got shrimp, brisket, mac/cheese, okra, cornbread, spinach, rice. The shrimp was the only thing on the place that was OK. They were overcooked slightly but seasoned well. The rice was edible but completely forgettable. It all goes downhill from there... The brisket is so far removed from "good brisket" that I can't really do it justice. It's dry and stringy beef. They carve it along the bias, rather than against it, which is a major no-no. You will chew this stuff for days. There's no crust and no juiciness. Major fail. The mac and cheese seemed like it had gone through a food processor or a blender. It was just cheesy mush without any discernable structure of noodle. (How is it possible to mess up mac and cheese?) The "creamed spinach" is basically raw/blanched spinach with some white sauce slapped on it. Zero flavor. Fail. The okra had giant, fibrous stalks in it that were basically inedible. Every third or forth bite, I had to reach into my mouth and pull out a 3" long mess of plant stalk that simply refused to break down in my chewing. Last (and possible least) is the cornbread. I have had much better out of a box. It's either soaked in butter or oil (probably to make it less dry?) but it's a dense brick of a corn-tasting substance and I felt dirty for eating it. I will gladly drive across town to Memphis Minnies from here on out. It's a shame because Baby Blues is walking distance from my house. But I simply can't ever eat at this place again. Sorry.

Not enough people come to the Outer Mish/Bernal Heights neighborhood, but the area is hopping. ?Who goes to the Marina anymore? ?It's SOMA and beyond now. Baby Blues was originally a 4 star review but after tasting the real BBQ experience in San Diego, I had to take this review down a star. ?Let's face it, we are BBQ deficient in SF; notwithstanding, Baby Blues is a fun restaurant for groups -- big and loud. ?And while this might be just an average place for you Kansas City and Memphis peeps, this is a good as it gets these days in SF.

Baby Blue, isn't that the name of Beyonce's new baby she had on Saturday? ?But no, the only babys here are baby back ribs. My first impression walking in was a good one. ?There is a nice bar with flat screens. Quite a few seats for dining, each table having four different BBQ sauces to choose from. ?And of course every eatery has a community table these days which I personally don't care for. ?Nobody wants to hear my conversations and you definitely can't tell any booger jokes or Pootie Tang talk: See, my damie, Pootie Tang don't wa-da-tah to the shama cow... 'cause thats a cama cama leepa-chaiii, dig? The menu had the normal sides like Mac & Cheese, Collard Greens, corn bread, etc. ?The meats are ribs, brisket, blackened catfish, chicken, etc. ?We ended up ordering the Blue Devil which is 4 meats with 3 sides. ?I would have ordered catfish but they don't fry theirs, so here's what we ordered: Memphis and baby back ribs: ?it's strange cause I didn't taste a difference. ?Both are cooked with dry rubs and charred almost too much but I like my ribs burnt a little so it was decent. ? Beef Brisket: ?was ok flavor but the brisket here is dried out. ?Kind of hard to swallow so take small bites or your company will be doing the heimlich maneuver to get that chunk of brisket out of your throat. Tiger Prawns: ?I really liked the prawns. ?But who doesn't like big prawns? The sides I got were Mac & Cheese, Baked Beans, and Mashed Sweet Potatoes. ?I had high hopes but each "fixin" as they call it was disappointing. ? The service was ok except the waitress dropped a jar of BBQ sauce right next to my girl and got sauce all over her. ?I would think the waitress would have gave some compensation of some sort, like a free beer or something for her. ?As Pootie Tang would say: "Wa Da Tah" (that's for sure). But the waitress didn't. The food was ok. ?But overall as Pootie would say "I gotta say Nay-No (No) my brotha.

If my diet consisted of only BBQ beef, chicken and pork I would frequent this place more often. Food: They serve their beef/pork/ribs right. It had enough spices and flavor that I feel you can eat it as is, without any BBQ sauces, if you want. Last night's side dishes of mac and cheese was on the thin side. The greens were meh but the beans were good. I wonder if they hired new kitchen staff? Service: It was so-so the night I was there. The host was moonlighting as a waitress and that didn't go well with our waiter. Hell, I was getting confused as to who to place my order with. Overall, I think it's always a good idea to train new staff. That said, I'd return and give them another chance.

Let me start, I love meat! ?I found the food very good my favorite was the grilled shrimp, the memphis ribs, and the mac and cheese. ?They had a happy hour special on the weekends mid day of $1 PBR and $2 off tap beer, the service was prompt and friendly and the food came out pretty fast. ? I will admit I love mixing my own sauses provided at the table, that was fun. the only down side to the whole experiance was the brisket, I was expecting something else. It was shredded and over cooked, I had expected it to be sliced, smoke ring.... Oh well everything else was really good so the one disappointment did not over shadow the event!

When the word BBQ is in the name, shouldn't the food come with BBQ SAUCE?? Don't people eat any form of BBQ mostly just for the sauce? Thought I would give this place a try off of Grub Hub for some comfort food on a cold night. Everything went great, ordering on my phone, until I actually had to interact with any human beings... The bike messenger was not very friendly; when I checked the order and questioned the lack of BBQ sauce he was less than accommodating- to put it nicely. Finally, he told me I could call the restaurant if I wanted (since he clearly wasn't going to lift a finger). After calling the restaurant 8 times- that's right, count it 8 times, someone finally picked up before the answering machine. Although he was nice, he too did not resolve the problem. He said it's the manager's protocol to NOT INCLUDE BBQ sauce unless requested, due to the cost?!?!?! If you are a BBQ restaurant, isn't your BBQ sauce supposed to be your secret sauce that gets people hooked on your food? Apparently not- they would rather save a few dimes than get people hooked. All I wanted was some BBQ sauce but I guess that's a lot to ask for from a BBQ restaurant. The mac-n-cheese is good, as in the sweet potato mash. The creamed spinach is okay. Corn bread is good but not amazing and would be a whole lot better with some BBQ sauce.... duh! $20 later I have a dinner for one sans BBQ sauce ughhhh.... I'm nice when people are nice to me; probably would have given them 4 or 5 stars if they had been willing to give me some BBQ sauce. They also didn't include a receipt with the food. Just the food in a plastic bag- me thinks perhaps they were trying to save a few more dimes on napkins and receipt paper?

I'll make this short and sweet... sauces- they are all vinegary. The molasses in the sweet sauce is overpowered by vinegar. The house sauce is the least vinegary and probably the best. The spicy sauce isn't really spicy. The ginger sauce, well, it just doesn't belong. None of the sauces are great. cornbread- super moist & tasty, but not really traditional corn bread sweet tea- they should just call it tea cause it sure ain't sweet ribs- DRY DRY DRY. I had to rip the meat off the bone. pulled pork- tasteless pork and beans- beans with pulled pork on top. Fat is part of what makes pork and beans delish. These were super bland. mac & cheese- the best part of the meal. If I ever go back I will eat a plate of mac & cheese and a side of cornbread. banana pudding w/vanilla wafers- their "most popular" dessert. The flavor is spot on, the consistency/texture is WAY off. It looks like a bowl of heavy whipped cream. Overall, I think the portions were really small and overpriced. At the end of our meal everyone at the table felt underwhelmed. Unless you live in the area it's probably not worth the hike.

Located on the corner and housed in a former Rexall drug store. ? But ?I was slightly disappointed with my food selection. ?Sure I ordered the small platter plate, but I could barely distinguish my baby back ribs on the plate. I had the "hound dog" platter of ribs and beef brisket with choice of one side and corn bread. ?I paid an extra $1.00 for the baby back in place of the Memphis style ribs. I get the stubby tail end of the baby back. ?Four dinky pieces. ?Yes, I know baby backs are the smaller ribs, but this was ridiculously small. ?And the beef brisket resembled pulled pork and tasted like pork. ?We asked the server if we got the brisket, and she confirmed yes. ?I got the sweet mashed potatoes as my side. Very good. Pros - reservations accepted. ?We were party of eight. ?Beer on draft. ?Choice of BBQ sauces ranging from sweet, tangy to spicy. ?You can request separate checks. ?We requested four. ?Fixings were good. And great R&B soul music playing in the background. Cons - noisy and hard to carry normal level conversation. ?Ribs so so. ?Beef brisket unlike any I've had in BBQ places. ?I'm accustomed to brisket like corn beef brisket where the pieces are sliced and not shredded. Your ribs are not dressed. ?You need to lather on the sauce yourself. ?The reason for four various BBQ sauces on the table. Hubby had the platter plate with two fixings and corn bread. ?He had the Memphis style pork ribs. Memphis style ribs = pork ribs, but longer than the baby backs and meatier. ?He got the sides of pork and beans and spicy chicken rice. 18% gratuity added to each check. ?Ours was $61.00 inc tax and tip. ?Three draft beers and two platter plates. I don't think I will be back.

This place is pricey ?for delivery food, so we were upset when they gave us salmon instead of the catfish we ordered without calling to ask if it was an acceptable substitution. ?It wasn't. Aside from that, the ribs are pretty good but the pulled pork and beef brisket are dry and terrible. ?The corn bread is disappointing with chewy, flavorless kernals of corn mixed in. ?The sides are hit and miss, but are the only thing worth going back for -- our favorites are the mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and collard greens. ?Avoid the creamed spinach!

We went for my boyfriend's birthday on a Friday evening, party of 10. I had made the reservation for 7 people the day before through their online reservation system (Open Table?), and increased the number of guests that evening and then early the day of, online. I also left a voice message for the restaurant before they opened that day to confirm that my reservation had changed, even though things seemed fine online. They did not call back. When we arrived, they only had the original guest number of 7 :( We had to wait 30-45 for a table. That should not have happened if the staff had checked their online reservations and listened to their phone messages when they opened that day! I expect meat to be falling off the bone if it's BBQ'd, and I like sauce. This place did not meet either of those expectations. By the waitress's recommendation, we ordered "The Beggar's Banquet" set menu for 10-14 people for $216. I liked the brisket and pulled pork. Ribs and chicken only had dry rub but there's sauce on the table. Cornbread was a lil dry. Mac n Cheese was real good with some funky tasty cheese in it! Pricey meal for being just alright.

I love their BBQ. I think the best deals are available for lunch. I usually get "The Hound Dog" platter which includes their memphis ribs & brisket. I find their memphis ribs to be a lot more tender and juicy than their baby back ribs. My friends went here for a birthday dinner party of 23 people and we ordered "The Extravaganza". It satisfied everyone and we're a bunch of heavy eaters! My friend sneaked in a bottle of Makers Mark and our waitress kindly allowed us to drink it in the restaurant. We offered her a shot of the whisky for her hospitality. Excellent food and great customer service!

My kids go here and love it great scene and reasonably priced food & drink. We needed take-out for a concert/taligate. We got a selection of vegetables, corn bread, and ribs.

We arrived in from Seattle and had literally just got off the plane - our good friend Kona brought us there with the promise of tasty ribs and we were not dissappointed. We all went with some form of ribs with the promise of family style dining. Worked out really well until became protective of my plate and didn't want to share anymore. I was enjoying mine too much. The ribs were all good great - nothing was overpowered with sauce, ribs we got were good cuts well cooked and fell off the bone. Sauces were a nice range of sweet to hot. Okra as a side was awesome. Mac and cheese I thought could have been better. Its a busy spot with lots of noise and chatter. Service was decent. I will be back next time I get to the bay.

My parents are quite aware of my Yelping. It seems that whenever we start discussing restaurants, we start debating which place in the neighborhood is good, which is overrated and which we have tried already and have yet to try. Ehhh, it seems we all have our opinion and interests. My Dad and I were going out for dinner the other night and couldn't make up our mind of which restaurant to go to. We stopped here because parking was ample. I had been looking forward to Baby Blues BBQ for quite sometime, but wasn't sure about the timing since I had plans later. BBQ takes time. We sat at the bar and checked out the menu. We ordered a couple pints of beer and the Prawn Appetizer to start. I noticed the custom bottles of Barbeque Sauce and the girl on the label. OMG, that's ME! :) Lol. The sauces were good and my favorite, the hot one - but don't get your hopes up, it was on the mild side. We like things spicy. The prawns were very yummy, 4 was enough as a mini appetizer before dinner. My Dad and I also like to share, I ordered the Beef Brisket Sandwich and he ordered the BBQ Chicken Sandwich. Both meals served with coleslaw and around $9.00 each. Great deal for dinner. My sandwich was sweet and good, the meat very tender. As messy as it looks, it was very good. The chicken sandwich was huge, an entire breast of chicken, grilled and soooo good. The sandwiches were pretty big and I gave my Dad the other half of my sandwich to take home. When we left, we thanked everyone for the good food and service. This is most definitely a place I will come back to and bring fellow BBQ lovers.

Ordered a brisket sandwich to go. They were extremely fast for how busy they were. The brisket was more of a braised or pulled brisket rather than large slices of brisket.

I think in the scheme of things, a big plate of meat, two sides and some cornbread more than warrants a $13 price tag. The same amount of money gets you a burger and some fries at a place like Five Guys. So what's the big hang up? I hadn't thought of it until midway through the meal that 99% of my friends in San Francisco are vegetarians. The one who eats meat loves when I come to town so he can hit up places like this with some company. Baby Blues it was. I was a bit skeptical of a BBQ place in San Francisco, especially one owned by people who apparently came from... Philadelphia? I dunno. The convictions of my youth regarding "_____ food must be made by ____ people to be good" is fading with the apathy of age. I Baby Blues put a pretty great and definitely large amount of food in front of me along with about five different BBQ sauces to douse it all in. The brisket spends some of its life in Guinness, so it already has quite a flavor on its own. But you can't pass up a little Sassy Molasses, or XXX BBQ sauce. The sides (collared greens and mashed potatoes) were surprisingly good as well. I loved the tang of the mashed potatoes. They offer Shiner beer if you really want to drive the Texas BBQ experience home. I went with sweet tea which was unfortunately West Coast Sweet Tea. As in, unless I'm totally crazy, I swear they just poured sugar into the tea after the fact instead of doing the traditional warming, application of sugar and then the cool down process. All in all, one mishap in the creation of sweet tea won't ever stop me from coming back again. This place is a nice change from the endless taco shops scattered all across the Mission.

Long on my list of places to check out, I finally made it in, hungry and ready to dig into some BBQ! I ordered the Texas rib (bear in mind, an order is ONE rib) and smoked chicken leg. This came with corn bread and two sides - collard greens and mashed sweet potatoes for me. To say that the portions are generous is an understatement. The Texas rib was tender, fatty and juicy, just like a short rib that's been braising for hours. This was a piece of meat that was BBQ'd, not baked, not roasted, not grilled, not boiled. At first glance it looks burnt, but cutting into it tells the whole story. I dipped pieces into some of the BBQ sauces, but it didn't really need it except to have the tangy sauce cut some of the richness of the meat. This is the first time I've had a beef rib with more meat than bone! I would be happy to order this over and over again. The chicken was perfectly cooked and had a good smoky flavor. As for the sides, the collard greens were okay. It wasn't prepared in the same manner as I've had at other BBQ restaurants, but they were fine. The mashed sweet potatoes were oozing butter. Quite delicious, if your name is Paula Deen. The corn bread was quite moist and tasted of corn. Service was good and the food was served relatively quickly. They have a good variety of beers on tap, along with wine. This place is no dive, as I would consider it one of the nicer BBQ joints I've ever patronized. Prices are on the high side for a reason....big portions of authentic BBQ.

Whats up with this place? I wanted to love it soooo much but it would not allow me to. First of all service is UNBELIEVABLY SLOW. It took our waitress 10 mins before she took our order. Then another 10 to15 mins for our drinks.. Which we had to ask for even though she passed us a dozen times. It was not even that busy of a night. Although the 2 servers were really nice girls the service was pretty bad. We spent soooo much time waiting...waiting...waiting. All the food was just mediocre. The Beef Brisket was just OK. Chicken & Wings just OK. The "fixins" were a huge letdown. I love cornbread.. its one of my favorite comfort foods. The cornbread had this taste to it that I could not figure out what it was (not a good taste). It was dense and greasy as all get out. The baked beans were not sweet like I like them. It was basically- just beans. The mashed potatoes were good. I could taste that they were mixed with sour cream. Those I liked.. that was about it. I didn't like any of the BBQ sauces they had on the table either. At least I was able to make a sweet beef brisket hash the next morning with the leftovers.

EPIC FAIL. Owner would not honor the Google coupon which clearly states "$7 for $15 of food and drinks." He said that it was $7 off a $30 purchase. Now, you don't have to math genius to figure out ... the owner is a douche. And he just lost a new customer who lives nearby and might have become a regular. Guess I'll just have to answer the call of the wild burrito coming from El Gran Taco Loco down the block.

(See pics) Local BBQ place if you want some meat dishes. The pulled pork and ribs (2 bones with 3 strips of meat) were flavorful, the corn bread was just a little bit undercooked, and the Mac n cheese was good.

Inconsistant When this place first opened my man brought home pulled pork sammies and fixens. Super yummy! Next time we ordered the smoked chicken to go. It was pink and uncooked. Totally inedible. The sides - mashed sweet potatoes had zero seasoning, butter or cream. Tasted like they were mashed with water, that's it. Mac & cheese, same thing...super bland. Corn bread was dry and hard. Not worth the calories. A year passes and we decide to try it again. Brisket and chicken were both delish. The sides were still bland but a bit better. The collard greens were watery. This time I realize the service is crazy slow. I ordered over the phone. The gal on the phone said 20 minutes so I waited 20 minutes and went down there. 45 minutes after ordering I'm walking out with my order. Lastly, I LOVE banana pudding. Even bad banana pudding is okay but when you pay $6 for a serving it should be a delight. So Mr. Baby Blues, I'm calling you out. There is so little effort in the desert you call banana pudding I question if it's anything more than boxed banana pudding, cool whip and nilla wafers. If you want my recipe let me know. I'm happy to share.

Went here a couple of weeks ago. Had a craving for some reallll good BBQ. Read the Yelp reviews and they seemed to be a littled mixed so I thought I'd form my own opinion. We got these things; Ribs Brisket Mac n Cheese Baked Beans Cream Spinach Cornbread Out of that whole list, the only thing really edible were the ribs. The ribs were just about cooked to perfection. The brisket although cooked well, lacked flavor. The mac n cheese I wouldn't have served -- if I had a restaurant. Our baked beans were burnt or had a over powering smoke flavor but no one could eat them. It was the same with the cream spinach, which was more like spinach leaves in a soupy white sauce and FINALLY the cornbread. I've never been a fan of corn in the cornbread but some of my aunts/uncles use it in their recipes because it usually helps to moisten the cornbread. This was not the case with Baby Blues, their cornbread was very gritty, dry and flat out hard at the edges. I really wanted to like this place but at the end of the meal, all I had was the "I just spent 55 bucks but only could eat one thing" blues.

I've been to Baby Blues in Venice and W. Hollywood. The former's ok, while the latter was so good. So I was expecting great things of the San Francisco location. I'd purchased a Google Offer for $15 off. Shock #1 came when the waitress informed me that to use the coupon, I'd have to spend $30. I asked where it said this in the offer and was told that that was in fact the deal. Being hungry and already there, what was I to do? Shock #2 was the sangria: My glass had four apple bits floating in it. Shock #3 was the most miserable portion of catfish. Perhaps it was kittenfish? It was smothered in some kind of sauce, as if to mask the lack of taste, too. Overall, the service was good (I understand the waitress was doing as instructed by management) as also the fixings and banana pudding. In all, though, an unpleasant experience.

It's some pretty good BBQ. ?I like that they don't slather sauces on the meat. ?Instead they have 5 different kinds of sauces you can dip your meat in. ?You'll get a mix of hot, tangy, sweet - all good! I shared the larger platter with one other person: Bones and No Bones: 1/2 Mesquite Ribs, pulled pork, cornbread, 2 fixins and 1 extra fixin. ?It was PLENTY for 2 of us. ? Yummy Fixins: Okra (tangy with tomato and cooked perfectly), Mac n Cheese (not too cheesy and heavy), Cole Slaw (my favorite, light on the mayo, lots of celery seeds). ? My BIL had the Texas Ribs (the only beef ribs on the menu): tender and more fatty than the port ribs. ?A LOT of meat plus the cornbread and 2 fixins. ?Could be shared by 2 people. ? They were out of the strawberry shortcake but we tried the pear cobbler, not bad. ? Service was friendly, parking - not so friendly. ?Get there early or you'll be circling for a while.

Easily my favorite BBQ place in the SF/Bay Area. ?Maybe a tad pricey, but the food is quality. ? Located in an old drugstore with mismatched furniture, there is a casual laidback vibe. ? The sides are decent if not spectacular. ?The one exception is the Blues/Corn on the cob, which is very good. ? Chicken Wings are great (ask for the Sweet Kick) & the Shrimp are flat out brilliant. ? Of the meats, my favorites are the Baby Back's & Memphis Dry Rub. ?Chuck on some of various sauces or eat plain, the meat is (95% of the time) cooked to perfection.

San Francisco doesn't have a good BBQ place or so I've been told. Reading some reviews I thought I give Baby Blues BBQ a try. Let me tell you about my experience. The decoration and the menu prices don't agree -- it it much too expensive for the dive type of decoration. The pork rib was nice, very nice but the BBQ sauce was just awful to the point of ruining what otherwise would have been a tasty rib. The one saving grace of this place is the free music. I happen to go on a night when a blues band of sorts was playing. It made forget how bad the BBQ sauce was and I didn't feel too bad when I got a bill over 50 dollars for 2 BBQ plates and a beer.

I've eaten here many times and also had food delivered a bunch as well. Food is consistently good and the price is very reasonable for what you get. I'm not going to argue about BBQ, since it's kinda like arguing about your favorite burrito - someone will ALWAYS tell you about the one place they know that's better. Fuck those people - Baby Blues gets it done. That said, the real reason I'm giving this place 5 stars and not just 4 is their service, which has been consistently good, both in terms of delivery and in-house. My last visit was with Holly, the mohawked, tatted-up, cute front-of-the-house person. Great service while dining, but when I left my card there after a drunken dinner and when I called to see if it was there, she recognized me via the phone and had it set up for me to pick up. Table stakes service sure, but delivered with a smile that made me what to come back. Funny thing is, she claims to be a nihilist. I tried to get a decent picture so I could create the "Nice Nihilist" Internet meme, but failed to get a decent one. I'm envisioning something like "Believes in nothing...except fantastic customer service" or "Thinks life has no meaning...tells you to have a great day!" Anyhoo, she rocks.

OK, so I HAVE to review this place because of the recent bad reviews they've received. You have to take the bitchy people who are not coherent and that can't spell with a grain of salt in reading these reviews. They are unfair and clearly not getting laid. I moved here recently from Portland, Oregon - which media has been in love with the past few years as THE new culinary city to pay attention to. I feel this is a fair assessment and I feel like I've been spoiled there - so hopefully that counts for something. I understand that one off experiences could have been bad - there is always that chance. However, tonight my boyfriend (who has been here a couple of times and has been suggesting it repeatedly) finally got me to check it out. I am originally from Walla Walla in Washington State, where BBQ is king and my dad is the master of hunting, curing and preparing meats. (I have really awesome deer meat jerky in my fridge right now that he made - yes, really.) What I loved about it: 1. I was able to order a nice mix of veggie-oriented foods (great salad with awesome onion vinaigrette, corn on the cob with some yummy cheesy seasoning, and mac-n-cheese) so I didn't feel like typical BBQ places where you eat a ton of meat and then moan because it takes forever to digest it all. 2. The meat: I had BBQ shrimp and it was awesome - not overcooked, but great with the variety of sauces. My boyfriend had catfish and it was also very tasty. 3. If you like decent wine and totally have gotten used to the crap selection in most places that are not super high end in this city - you will be very pleasantly surprised. My boyfriend is European and I'm a wine snob and they have Sencerre on the menu....at a BBQ place! We found out the owner's partner is French and picked the wines - nice work! 4. For dessert we ate apple pie that had just come out of the oven and it was amazing. Enough said. 5. The service was great. I'm straight, but the young women were super cute and sweet and total eye candy. The owner talked us up when we asked him if it was his place and was really nice too. We will definitely be back and will also be ordering from them for 4th of July - as they are doing specials where they marinade and prep the ribs and chicken and make you look really good on your home grill.

Admittedly my partner and I are a tough sell for BBQ - one Kansan, and one southerner. My Mom mixed BBQ sauce in my baby formula, and when I outgrew that, they practically raised me at Shorty's in South Florida. We have never found BBQ in the Bay Area we thought was worth eating other than my homemade BBQ chicken (with my homemade BBQ sauce). See my review of Boss Hawg's in Topeka if you want to get idea of what we like in the way of 'cue. A friend told us about Baby Blues a few months ago and tonight we gave it a try. Not great, but not too bad either - the best BBQ we've had in the Bay Area. But as my partner said, that's not saying much. We ordered a half rack of ribs, a beef brisket platter, and mac and cheese and baked beans sides. The good news - the ribs were quite good 0 a little on the dry side, but tasty and meaty. I'd definitely have 'em again.The brisket was pretty tasty too. We both liked the sauces - I preferred the regular sauce, while partner preferred the sweet. The bad news - the sides. The beans - tasteless. Ditto the mac and cheese. The cornbread was downright bad, not identifiable as cornbread. Zero corn flavors in that overly moist glop. Probably the worst I've ever had of all three of those dishes. My impression is that Baby Blues is trying to do too much, and it doesn't do anything all that well. Texas, Memphis, and Carolina BBQ are all on the menu. The place might be better served by just concentrating on one style, and doing it well. We'll probably go back just 'cause there's nothing much else around, and hope we can find some better sides.

I came to Baby Blues BBQ for a weekday dinner with a friend and we both ordered a Pulled Pork Platter which came with two sides and cornbread. The restaurant was pretty empty when we came and our food was brought out so fast, it was like the kitchen read our minds and prepped our order before we even placed it with the waitress. For my two sides, I went with the mac-n-cheese and cole slaw. The pulled pork was moist and went really well with the sauce out of the round bottle which had a spicy kick that just spreads on your tongue (the round bottle at our table didn't have a tag on it so I'm not sure what it's called). I tried the original sauce which was nothing too special, and the sassy molasses which tastes like your standard bbq sauce. There was one more sauce on the table, ginger tabasco I believe which I opted not to try. I really enjoyed the corn bread which was packed with corn kernels. However the bland cole slaw wasn't my favorite and the mac-n-cheese was nice and soft but I could not stand the bleu cheese flavor in the mac. Service was good and there's a bunch of interesting decor pieces throughout the restaurant. Although I wasn't very impressed with my first platter at Baby Blues, I'd like to return to try a slab of ribs.

5 stars for some of the best hot dang BBQ/brisket I have had in a long time! ?They do the brisket their own way - similar to a pulled pork sort of thing. ?Creamed spinach was different than the usual too - more of a fresh spinach in light cream. ?Mashed potatoes rocked. ?Minus 1 star for prices being on the high side (especially when accounting for table service).

I've been here 3-4 times, and the place is OK. Maybe it's because I'm from the Midwest, but it seems to me a BBQ place ought to have fall-off-the-bone fantastic ribs, if nothing else. And the ribs here are just OK. And the cornbread: it's just OK. It's not horrible, mind you, but... meh. I will say that in BBQ options in SF are scarse, so it's to their credit that they offer this cuisine. So if you have that hankerin' this grub will hit the spot. If nothing else, the creamed spinach is some of the best I've ever had. They don't kill the spinach, and its not drenched in butter and cream. But why do they nail creamed spinach but fall short on slaw, cornbread, and ribs? But again, ?if you have that hankerin'... you're not gonna complain. PS: For delivery in the area: LIGHTNING fast. I think faster than if we ordered it at the restaurant! Grubhub it... Crazy.

Upon further review, went back away, and it wasn't nearly as good. ?Everything was just "pretty good." ------ Best BBQ restaurant I've been to in San Fran. Had the half rack Memphis with 1/4 white meat chicken, collared greens, and mac'n'cheese. ? Ribs were very good, not incredible. ?Like the dry rub style. ?While the meat was tender, the outside was a bit over cooked. ?I'm into the contrast, but I think the outside should have been less tough. ?Still, very good, and great with the sauces. ? I used the "Original Sauce" and then mixed it with one of their hotter sauces, which I think was Tabasco-based. ?That's not my thing because Tabasco, if it actually was that, has such a unique flavor it almost dominates the hot. ?Rather they use a lesser known sauce; something I'm not familiar with. ?However, I mixed the two, and again, damn good. Chicken was cooked to PERFECTION. ?The Moms made a legendary chicken, and my friends back in Jersey have won AWARDS (http://www.localsmokebbq) for their chicken. ?This was damn good chicken. Collared greens used a tomato based sauce, and I love that. ?Might have been my favorite thing, which is rare for me. ?Could have eaten a bucket of the greens. Mac and Cheese was fluffy, tasty, and perfectly cooked. ?LOVE it. Had a Marzen beer by Gordon Biersch, which is a brew I really like a lot. All told, cost me around $29, which is about $4-5 too pricey, but still worth it. Plus the Giants lose to the Phillies, AGAIN, which was nice. For San Fran BBQ, as good as it gets, yes.

My boyfriend wanted to go here, he swore it was really good. He had been here before... there's just one problem... I really don't like to eat meat off the bone. It's 2011. I am not a barbarian. I don't need to rip meat off of the bone with my mouth. All of that changed while I was at Baby Blues BBQ. It was so tasty. They have like 5 different kinds of bbq sauce- are you frickin' kidding me?? I LOVE BARBACUE SAUCE. It's so tasty. I want to put it on everything. But to have 5 different kinds to taste. I was in food amazement. We ate at the bar. The bartender was very attentative and super sweet. I'm definitely going back.

After reading some reviews I decided to give these guys one last chance to impress me. I went all out and ordered one of their pricey "Platters", the one called Memphis Queen. For $25 I got a half order of baby back ribs and a half of "Memphis" ribs with two sides and corn bread. The sides I chose were the collard greens and the okra but they were out of the okra so I accepted corn on the cob, The server recommended the Mac n cheese but I'd had it before and thought it was mediocre at best. I don't know a tactful way of putting it but the ribs just aren't good. I realize this is a "Texas style" BBQ place were they dry rub instead of "saucing" the meat but the rub tasted like chemicals. I tried all four of the sauces and didn't like any of them. The XXXX was hot but the strongest taste was vinegar, there was no depth or character to the flavor. The "Tabasco" was about the same except a little less hot and vinegary. Honestly the "sassy" and the "molassy" sauces were so boring that I can't even remember them well enough to complain. Pros: Beer on tap The take cards, most BBQ places are cash only. Friendly service God sides The best corn bread I've ever had Cons: Bad tasting ribs Over priced for BBQ I've wasted enough time and money here! I wish someone would open a great BBQ joint in The City.

I came here because of my google offers coupon. I have walked by the place plenty of times since I've been to El Rio a lot. Anyway, I had the BBQ chicken sandwich. It was pretty good. My lunch came with sweet potatoes and that was excellent to. I really love this place. Not only is the good great (order the catfish to take home) but the service is even better. As soon as you walk in, you are greeted. If the waitress or waiter is not close to the door, they briskly walk towards the new customers to greet you and show you to a table. Once I placed my order, they made sure to come back to me to let me know that my order was on its way. When my order was delivered, I was asked and explained to the different sauces they had. There is also a bar with a TV so you can even watch a game or just watch the news. The service was prompt, accurate, and very friendly. I cannot wait to try the other things they have on the menu. Oh yah, I still have to the catfish in my frig to try. Yay!!!

What's Memorial Day Weekend without a barbecue? ?I took the easy route this year and went to a restaurant to get my BBQ fix. ?Baby Blues BBQ has been on my radar for quite some time. ?I always pass their establishment on my way into the Mission, but I'd never actually stopped in. ?A peek at the Carnaval SF website that morning reminded me Baby Blues BBQ was a must for the weekend. ?The restaurant is noted as a sponsor for the event, and having worked in the events business for the past two decades I know how important sponsors are to local events. I stopped in for linner. ?That's the pre-4:00 PM pocket between lunch and dinner. ?I had perused the menu adhered to the window before I walked in. ?The space inside is certainly a lot bigger than it looks from the outside. ?Lots of communal tables and individual tables with a mish mash of different types of chairs, I'd say the interior is pretty cool. Greeted by a gentleman who asked me to take any seat I did so at a nice little table hidden from the sun's glare outside. ?I was handed the menu which I handed right back. ?I ordered the half rack of baby back ribs which includes cornbread and two sides dubbed "fixins" here. ?The two sides I ordered were mashed potatoes and cole slaw. ?I ordered a Coke to wash it all down with. Surprisingly, the wait was pretty short. ?From experience I've come to expect longer waits at BBQ places but that wasn't the case here. ?They screwed up my order. ?Either that or they read my mind. ?While perusing the menu outside and going down the list of sides I stopped and wondered what chicken smoked rice was but decided against trying new things. ?Guess what they brought me instead of the mashed potatoes? ?Yup, it was the chicken smoked rice! ?The sides are huge here (http://www.yelp.com/biz_) as they are served in bowls equivalent to my rice bowls at home. ?With the two big bowls of sides I was prepared to be stuffed. The rice was very good. ?There was no smoky flavor though, but the seasoning was quite good. ?It was kind of like a slightly dirty rice. ?I liked the cole slaw a lot because it was creamy without being overly so. ?The seasoning in that was very good also. ?The huge slab of cornbread was a bit hard and crusty along the edges but the heart of the bread was nice and moist with lots of corn kernels mixed into the batter. I loved the baby back ribs. ?Served dry with a blackened, smoky rub the ribs were not fall off the bone but they were super meaty, moist and tender nonetheless. ?There are four sauces to choose from and a bottle of vinegar with pickled hot peppers. ?The molasses based sauce was just wrong for my taste and the XXX sauce had just one X too many for me as it quickly rose up my nostril and continued on instantly forming a teardrop at the edge of my eye. ?I found the best sauce for me was actually a mix of the regular BBQ sauce and the Ginger Tabasco Sauce. ? Baby Blues BBQ, sorry for ignoring your restaurant all this time. ?I'll be back for more!

Cute joint. Went here to waist some time waiting for the burlesque show at the El Rio across the street. When you walk into this place, you are welcomed by the smell of BBQ. As a vegetarian I just got a side dish. But our friend got some hot wings, she said it was defiantly hot. The waitress showed us 4 difference BBQ sauce that was on our table. Overall, this is a super clean place and I recommend it for people to check out if you like BBQ food.

Ordered the Brisket sandwich lunch special. ?Having not really looked at the menu and thinking that Brisket ought to be sliced, was really disappointed to find a meat jello mush on garlic bread. ?The mac-n-cheese side I ordered was overcooked pasta in a cheese substance that more resembled cottage cheese than anything else. ? I should have known better when I saw the Filthadelphia sports paraphernalia all over the bar.

Jamie W. and I must have passed by this place a gazillion (read: dozen or so) times on our way to our pupusa preparers of choice, the chicas of El Zocalo. It was likely the prominence of the vintage neon Rexall Drugs sign that made us bypass Baby Blues, but I was alerted by a co-worker that indeed there was a rib joint under the sign (see my photos). Lo and behold, there it is in the Outer Mission near cool-crowd eateries like Blue Plate, Front Porch and Emmy's. Inside you are struck by the hipster vibe of the place. This ain't no Everett & Jones, that's for sure, and there isn't much of a trace of its sister joint down in bustling Venice Beach. I'm only aware of the popular SoCal place through the Travel Channel. This location feels more isolated from a foot traffic standpoint, which left me to wonder if people are willing to seek it out. I guess they do since we were there on a Thursday evening and had to sit at the community table in front. That wasn't too bad since we had a clear view of the ukulele collection in the china hutch (see my photo). Jamie ordered the $19.95 Smoked Baby Back Ribs, while I went for the $17.95 Memphis-Style Long Bone Pork Ribs (see my photos). Both were tender and tasty, especially when you squirt the hotter of the three squeeze bottles of sauce on the table. The sides should have been a slam dunk by comparison. They weren't. The Collard Greens were a complete miss...too watery, too salty to make even the bacon bits stand out. The Chicken Smoked Rice was just dirty rice that wasn't dirty enough for my taste. Jamie had better luck with the Mashed Potatoes (a no-brainer) and Blues on the Cob, although he even thought the cheese was superfluous to a good ear with butter. The cornbread almost saved the day but just almost. Regardless, I have to give props to the service. Two girls kept coming by to make sure our glasses of Diet Coke were refilled. It's a little too pricey for me to make it a regular hangout, but I think the sandwiches - which are about half the price of the rib slabs - sound like a good deal. We'll be back, but I gotta try some other sides. FOOD - 4 stars...the ribs reign supreme, but the sides made me cry AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...oh yeah, uh-huh, need to listen to some blues SERVICE - 4 stars...like classic stewardesses on a Pan Am flight circa 1963 TOTAL - 4 stars...for the ribs they do right

I am about to do you all a very BIG favor. Save yourself the trouble and DO NOT EAT HERE. I went here tonight with a friend, and we were really looking forward to it. I did bring some home the other night, but only the sides. We sat at the bar since there would be about a 20-30 minute wait for a table. I was set on having the Baby Back ribs. They were out, until 7:00. They were also out of the "long bone" spare ribs. What kind of BBQ place runs out of ribs?! Disappointed, I settled on the Pulled Pork Platter. We also ordered an appetizer to get us going. That was OK ... the only choice is pork, chicken, or shrimp on corn bread, served open face with cole slaw. But before we get our appetizer, we get a chicken sandwich we didn't order. Turns out it was for somebody else at the bar. Forty Five minutes later, still no entree for either of us. A couple seated next to us ordered basically the same thing, but different sides, AND seated long after us, got their food first. What the hell is that?! We start to get annoyed, as take out bags were flying out the door, and more people seated after us got their food. We asked for our food, got no response, other than befuddled looks from the servers. The guy behind the counter completely ignored our requests, hand waves, etc. We ended up leaving having just the appetizer. We didn't even wait for the bill but out of the goodness of my heart, I left a $20 with a note telling whoever cared to read it that no food is worth that wait. DEFINITELY WILL NOT GO BACK. Neither should you.

Came here twice. ?The first time we were seated after a short wait, and given time to review the menu. ?I was starving, and smelling that sweet aroma of bbq was only intensifying my hunger. ?Alas, we make our order and wait..and wait...and wait. ?Next thing you know our server comes back to inform us that, "THEY'VE RUN OUT OF FOOD"! $#%^$^%$^$#%#$%! Not being able to try the food, but being allowed to sit and smell it only made me want it more. ?So we return to Baby Blues a few weeks later. I opt for the pulled pork with mac & cheese and baked beans as my sides. ?My dining buddy chooses the 1/2 rack of baby backs with baked beans and rice. ?The bbq was ok. ?Nothing to make me jump out of my seat and exclaim what a glorious meal it was. ?They do have this pepper/oil/vinegar concoction that's recommended to pour onto the pulled pork...that was pretty fabulous. ?Also they have different bbq sauces at your table with varied degrees of heat. ?That was nice to have. ? Overall, the food was ok. ?Service could have been better-I had to flag our waitress down twice for refills and once more for our check. ?I will not be coming back to Baby Blues.

MMM bbq. ?After becoming a meat eater again after 6 years of being a vegetarian, I really wanted some BBQ. I was a little hesitant before coming in due to the highly mixed reviews of this place, but have to say, I was not let down. We were able to get a seat right away. ?I was amazed at how many sauces they had at the table (although it took up a lot of space) to help customize how you want your ribs or change the sauces in the middle of the meal. I got the Mason Dixon with mashed potatoes and caesar salad. ?Salad was standard, felt like I needed some veggies to balance out all the meat. ?The mashed potatoes were good but a little dry and lumpy. Corn bread was good. ?Chicken was meh, I felt I was eating more charred skin/bones than the actual meat. I have to say the star of the dish was the ribs. ?They were pretty good, especially with the house sauce or the sassy molassy sauce. ?My boyfriend ended up getting the bones/no bones. ?The beef was really good. ?His baked beans were alright, but the cole slaw was bland. In the end, Baby Blues BBQ wasn't that bad. ?There were some up's and downs but I'd still like to try them again.

I came here for lunch after my conclusion of my brief project in Bernal Heights. Seated immediately and looking at the menu, all the meal's prices starting from $15.00. But I was here during lunch time and the menu has a few lunch specials. And I've chosen, "The Cherokee Spike" plate. For $11.95, I get a scoop of Pulled Pork, Beef-Brisket and two Hot Links with a piece of cornbread and one side, in which I chose the Creamed Spinach. I get three choices of sauce to use for my meats. And you'll definitely need it, because the meats were bland and tasteless without them. ?I used the Habenero Barbecue sauce and made my two scoop of meats a somewhat an improvement. My piece of Cornbread had a crunchy top, but a surprisingly moist interior. And for the Creamed Spinach, "yeah right... you think I actually ate that?" My meal: http://www.yelp.com/biz_ I also got a refreshing $2.00 cup of Sweet Tea with my meal and free refills too. ? My drink: http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Used my Visa for my decent lunch. Lunchtime seems like the best deal. But with the high-price dinner on the menu, it may be questionable if I might return.

I just spent the last three days in bed with a cold. It let me catch up on some reading and movie watching. The one outstanding moment was re-watching Coal Miner's Daughter. Damn, it's a good movie. I'm too young to remember Loretta Lynn and her music but she is a very intriguing success story. She marries this coal miner named 'Dew' and they embark on an adventure which eventually leads to her becoming the top country music singer in the entire United States of America. I know I sound like 'Forest Gump' right now. Please forgive. When I think about coal miner's daughter, I think about BBQ. Luckily, I have Baby Blues BBQ in the mission. It is the BEST bbq restaurant in the city. It's not even close. Sissy Spacek sings a signature song which states, "I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter..." ?Well, I'm a first generation immigrant from Vietnam. I'm proud to be a "first immigrant son of a engineer's son." The country singing is in progress... 5 stars.

BBQ--can't think of anything better to take the place of the old Rexall Drugstore. And I love how there are signs up still advertising "DRUGS." Baby Blues BBQ made such a fantastic first impression on us that we came back twice in one week. I couldn't get my mind off of them. Here are my notes: Visit #1: Late lunch: we walk into an enormous space with Bob Marley on the speakers & are greeted by our waitress telling us to take a seat anywhere we'd like (the only other patrons were at the bar, enjoying their liquid lunch, i assume.) We pass up the communal table & the bar & opt for a seat on the bench along the wall. The lunch specials, served from 12-4pm, are well priced at under $13 for sandwiches & meats combos, but I noticed their "platters" are priced higher than other BBQ joints in the city. We shared "The Blue Devil:" 4 meats & 3 "fixins" for $31.95. (Roadside BBQ on Geary charges $23 & i think Memphis Minnies does 3 meats/2 sides for $20.) Their BBQ shrimp, which I've never had at a BBQ joint, gets 5 stars. They were large, a little spicy from the sauce & grilled to perfection. Honestly, they were the reason we came back. I also really enjoyed their sides; blues on the cob (sprinkled w/ cheese) & mac & cheese were both excellent. I could take or leave: their brisket (pulled & shredded--never seen brisket done this way before) & their beef ribs, which were meaty but also fatty. (Not all beef ribs are fatty--case in point: the ones from Roadside BBQ.) Their corn bread is moist & full of corn, but there is a spice in it (which I can't identify) that gives it a pungent taste I don't particularly care for. Did not try: pulled pork & chicken smoked rice. According to the bf, both were so-so. Their BBQ sauces are watery, but still quite flavorful. I enjoyed the Ginger Tabasco the most. _________________________________ Visit #2: Late dinner, right before they were set to close. We walk in & are seated near the ukuleles. The place looks different when dim; definitely very festive w/ Christmas lights & dancehall playing loudly. I'm seeing details & decorations I missed the first time around & dig the eclectic mishmash of items. We order "Big Blue" which is 3 meats w/ 2 fixins for $25.95. They ran out of BBQ chicken (which the bf was excited to try) so in addition to baby back ribs, we doubled up on our shrimp order. The shrimp were as succulent as we remembered (altho I think we were a few shrimp shy of a double portion...) Their baby back ribs were wonderful; it had a nice crust & wasn't too smoky. Again, the sides (mashed potatoes w/ some skin left in it & baked beans) were a hit. I liked their banana pudding, but the bf commented it just tasted like banana flavored whipped cream (which means I don't have to share.) We've been here once when it was pretty empty & once when it was packed & our servers have always been great; they're quick & get our orders right. Love the location, love the atmosphere & most importantly, love (most of the) food. With flavors & quality this good, it's no wonder Baby Blues BBQ's got a serious hold on our attention.

At long last we have good barbeque in San Francisco! ?And it's in a perfect location - the cool but not trendy food corridor that is lower Bernal Heights, home to Blue Plate and the Front Porch. ? Some people judge their barbeque by the ribs. ?Some, the sides. ?Me, the deal maker or breaker is always the chicken. ?And let me tell you, the chicken is finger licking, no, entire hand and chin licking good. ?One thing that tells you a lot about good barbeque is the meat. ?This meat does not have to be slathered in sauce to have a lot of flavor - it falls off of the bone and has just the right amount of smoke. I tried the "Suicide King" to start - pulled pork on top of cornbread with slaw and cheese - delicious. ?Huge and filling (4 portions) so you will want to share otherwise you will definitely kill your appetite - hence, the Suicide. For my main, I had the "Mason Dixon", half Memphis Ribs and a quarter chicken. ?The chicken was as described above, and the pork ribs were tender, juicy, not at all greasy, and with just the right amount of char. ?There are 3 sauces to try at the table - regular, XXX, and a peppered vinegar - all good, but honesty the meat doesn't need them. Sides. ?Important and hard to get right. ?You get 2 with your entree and I had the Collard Greens and "blues on the cob", grilled corn with Chipotle butter and cheese. ?The collards were excellent - highly recommend. ?Not too mushy and spiced just right. ?The corn was good, well cooked, but surprisingly more bland than I expected. ?The cornbread - now that was a treat. ?So dense and moist, it was like a little brick of happiness. Portions are huge - see pics. This food goes best with beer, and I washed mine down with a tall Blue Moon. ?Delicious! Pecan pie for dessert - sweet and sticky good. Service was great, and I loved the casual atmosphere. ?I will be here again and again - and I am more than a little tempted to try one of their "Feed Bag" catered meals for my next party. Go celebrate the new year with some good, well-made, REAL barbeque. ? ?Don't wear your finest, because you may end up spotted and stained, but you will definitely be wearing a smile on your way out. ?Best way to beat the blues, baby!

The huge DRUGS sign overhead is fitting, as this place is addictive. The 'Mason Dixon' was perfect. I prefer dry rubbed, but the sticky, tangy char on these ribs may convert me yet. Each succulent rib pulled clean off the bone, and the sauce doesn't stick to your teeth. The chicken was just as good, with a lighter dose of sauce to balance the milder flavor. Both the mashed sweets and mac n' cheese were nice compliments. The cornbread is worth special mention. It is more dense and cake-like than the more crumbly variety found elsewhere. It almost deserves a spot on the dessert menu. Dessert. We ordered Pecan Pie and a Peach Betty. Sadly, by the time I arrived for pick up, they'd run out of the Peach Betty. Sensing my disappointment and indifference to substitution of Banana Pudding, the owner graciously served up two desserts to go with the sweet Pecan Pie, free of charge! A generous slice of moist Chocolate Kahlua Cake and two servings of their homemade Banana Pudding went home with me. One bite of the Banana Pudding and I knew why he was so proud of it. It is Phenomenal, ?with a mellow banana flavor in a rich consistency somewhere between a dense mousse and buttercream. Sin with Nilla Wafers. Half a serving and I was staring at the ceiling in bliss. Like the junkiemaker says, "The first one's free..." Note: If picking up, bring a wingman to right-turn circle the block for your getaway since traffic routing on that end of Precita is crazy cryptic.

I came here for a B-day dinner (party of 15 or so) on a Thurs night.... We ordered The Beggars Banquet feed bag.... Everything was delicious! The chicken was juicy..the ribs were perfect...my favorite was the brisket with the pepper/vinegar sauce in the huge glass bottle on the table. I also liked the variety of sauces on the table, I just wish there were a mustard based sauce. There was also pulled pork, creamed spinach(just o.k.) mac-n-cheese, mashed potatoes, beans were awesome... the cornbread was the best I've had..super sweet and not dry at all. The birthday girl got a huge dessert plate sampler with candles.. there was enough dessert for everyone to share. I think I may have my b-day dinner here... The food was good and for the price (about $25 per person) everyone was stuffed!!! Can't wait to go back.

OMG NOM NOM BBQ I really enjoyed this BBQ place. ?Specializing in a North Carolina style BBQ (Maybe. What do I know? I'm from Florida.), they make a serious roasted rib. ?(It's not the pink ring style.) Both the Memphis (regular) pork ribs and the baby back ribs were toothsome. ?I also enjoyed the surprising but tasty renditions of collard greens and moist corn bread. ? I split one of the large ($24) plates with a friend and we were both dead afterward. ?I wished I could have had the the Mac N Cheese, but I was with someone keeping kosher for Passover. ?That's right, the way she keeps Kosher for Passover is eating pork ribs with sweet potatoes. ?That's how we Jews roll. They also have a few spicy-ass sauces. ?I prefered the sweet one, which had kick too. ?Oh, and if you're a vegan, stay far away!

If you are looking for a good place to buy GUNS or DRUGS, I recommend hanging out by Baby Blues BBQ. ?It's not a negative comment, but rather a true reflection of the harsh reality. ?The building where Baby Blues is located used to be a Rexall Drugstore, and the old DRUGS sign is still there. ?The much more modest neon "BBQ" sign almost pales in comparison. ?Less than a half block away, the old gun store proudly is identified by the menacing GUNS sign. ?The point I am trying to make is this: it's a perfect location for this kind of place. When you walk in, you feel as though you entered a large kitchen or a small barn. ?Sure, the bar, the flat screen TVs and the contemporary art on the walls might remind you of a trendy restaurant, but . . . ?The ratty checkered tablecloths, wobbly tables and mismatched chairs make you wonder whether you wandered into someone's garage by mistake. ?Then you see a giant BBQ pit, and you don't know what to believe anymore. The hostess and the waiters are all incredibly nice. ?While the food does take a long time (I did wonder if they had forgotten our orders), they really try to take care of you. ?They refilled my soda at least 3 times before our food came out, and I didn't even have to ask. ?You don't expect great service in a place like this, but you do get it at Baby Blues. ?I should have ordered the Kool-Aid ($2, unlimited refills) just because. ?Can you think of a place that has Kool-Aid on the menu? ?I can't. Now, for the food itself. ?I had the pulled pork plate. ?For $13.95, it comes with two sides and a piece of cornbread. ?I was not impressed with the pulled pork itself, and neither was my friend. ?We agreed that it tasted a bit "watery," like pork from a can would. ?I felt like it tasted more boiled than it did BBQ'd. ?We also shared a 1/2 lb of brisket ($6.50), which did not look or feel like 1/2 lb. ?The brisket was also shredded and looked very much like the pork, but tasted much better. ?It was more solidly cooked and more BBQ'd. ? The sides were definitely the best part of the meal, which is not exactly a ringing endorsement for a BBQ place. ?My friend actually ordered The Sidecar (4 sides + cornbread), and that may have been the way to go. ?My mac 'n' cheese was gooey and delicious, with crunchy breadcrumb crust. ? The mashed sweet potatoes were a bit runny, but delicious nonetheless. ?The cornbread was a different story. ?Baby Blues cornbread is different, and nobody likes different. ?It was darker, harder and sweeter than what I would expect cornbread to be. ?I love corn and I finished the whole piece, but it just wasn't that great. ? The bill for the three of us (3 dinners, extra side of brisket, 3 beers and a soda) was $70+tip. ?Definitely not a cheap dinner, but not a bank breaker, either. ?I'd probably come back here again, but I am not going to expect anything super authentic and out of this world. ?You shouldn't, either.

Solid, solid, solid. All around solid. I was never a fan of BBQ which has a char-broiled finish to it. I wouldn't say I am now convert, but I can say that I am happy to look the other way with Baby Blues' ribs. Meat falling off the bones and dry rub flavor shines through the char-broil. Standard barbeque sauce on the table was flavorful without overpowering (tomato-based with a hint of vinegar.) Wide variety of well executed sides including mashed sweet potatoes, baked beans, mac and cheese and collard greens. The waiter mentioned something about the cole slaw having wasabi undertones, but I wish I didn't hear that. I would rather live my fantasy of the perfect, TRADITIONAL, barbeque outside of the likes of Memphis or the Carolinas. Mac and cheese seemed to have spices that added character as well, but it would have worked for me without the complexity. They have both world-class beers on tap and distinctive but cost-effective wines by the glass. They had me at the German pils and Argentinean malbec. They even had Kool-Ade for the kids. Desserts including pecan pie and bread pudding looked great but I didn't ?have room. Some purists would say that the atmosphere, menu etal. is too high brow for an authentic BBQ joint. I tend to agree, but the place is good at resetting expectations and having customers leave satisfied. They might have a sign somewhere outside, but I didn't see it. I just followed my GPS to the street address. Additional confusion stems from their converting an old drug store with Rexall sign in tact. When I was there for lunch on MLK day, I found ample parking near by on Mission as well as on the side street.

There are only a handful of things I'm unabashedly proud of as an American. ?As a point of reference I'll tell you something I'm abashedly proud of as an American; wanting to be #1. ?Eat, drink, score, blow up, kick ass... the most. ?I love it but in this wincing sort of way where I can only embrace it with one foot on the floor. With BBQ, I've got every part of me in bed. ?BBQ, Jazz and I'm coming up short on anything else I can get in bed with that's 100% American. ? With that being said, all things intrinsically American are intrinsically individual. ?BBQ embodies this. ?So, folks could argue, it's difficult to pass judgement on BBQ. ?And they would be wrong. ?There are good books and bad books, movies, corn dogs, blow jobs, and BBQ. ?Yes, there's room for personal preference, taste etc. but there are certain key basics that cannot be dodged and then, all other things being equal, the accoutrement makes up the difference. Baby Blues you are trying like a motherfucker to get the job done and you are failing. ?You're talking the talk with only a half-ass stumble of a walk to go with it. brisket - subpar, not tender, no bark to speak of, wondering if it was even smoked at all pulled pork - perhaps the easiest bbq to do decently was just that. ?Stringy, not richly flavored Ribs - sauce covered. ?people like this so I can't really ding them for it but, really? ?Serving me BBQ'ed (that means smoked) meats slathered in sauce has the same effect on me as walking up to someone at a club and being overpowered by a cloud of perfume/cologne. Sides - uber forgettable cornbread - borderline inedible service - sucked badly enough the manager had to take over our table and comp our dessert I wanted this place to be good, it was right in my hood, it had a nice setup/deco but it just fell down in every way that really counted. ?There's some effort there but without a solid foundation of food to start from you don't stand a chance.

Baby Blue's beef ribs is what Chris Rock was talking about in the FIRST EVER movie he appeared in. "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka!". ?Check it out. http://www.youtube.com/w All you need is one rib because they are literally gigantor. They remind me of the Flintstones cartoon at the ending credits when Fred is driving away in his car carrying that one gigantic piece of meat. That rib is about the size of a forearm, from a gorilla. It's not just size that counts, so I've heard, but these ribs are juicy and tasty as well. They have a really good smoked flavor and I like how they have a char to them. That char gives it a real authentic taste that I like. It's kinda like how I grill/bbq some of my food on the Weber grill and forget about the food because I was doing something else that the food ends up getting a little burnt but then it's all good because you can tell it's homemade. The cool little bar where they also have a plasma for sports is perfect for selecting BB's as a guy's night out dinner. Their ribs shine, while the baby back rib's are tastier than the beef brisket. The brisket was a little grainy and kinda resembled a wet mop on a plate. Oh my, the sides. We had a group of 4 hungry guys so I had a chance to taste a whole bunch. 1. Mac and cheese - baked, cheesiness, nice crust. my favorite one 2. mashed sweet potatoes - delicious, smooth, sweet, warm, hug. 3. pork and beans - beans with tons of pulled pork, could also be a meal by itself for lunch 4. corn on the cob - this like the rib is gigantic, grilled. 5. potato salad - it had a tart zing to it, interesting 6. cream of spinach - not pureed and creamy like HOPR style, whole spinach boiled down with milk sauce. aiight My new favorite BBQ joint. Not a place that you'll eat once a week, but def a place if you're looking for good Q. If you want to feel like a man, eat here.

I grew up on sweet tea. It was as common as breathing. Summers on Granny's porch helping her shuck corn from her garden or destring some beans were often cooled down with tall, sweaty glasses of iced tea sweetened with plenty of sugar. Little soothes the sweat of sweltering Southern summers like sweet, sweet tea. Baby Blues BBQ has sweet tea. And it's exactly like the elixir I remember from my youth. The boyfriend and I went here one Friday night for a date. We'd ordered takeout from them a couple of times before, but this was our first dine-in experience. And it rocked. We didn't have to wait long at all for a table, and the hostess was quick and competent. Our server was attentive, energetic and as friendly as a waitress out to be at a BBQ joint. San Francisco is a foodie town where far too often the servers slack off because the food carries so much weight. And it kinda sucks; they sometimes act like you are doing them a favor by chosing to dine there. This server was a gem, though. No pretense, prompt and most importantly of all, attentive. (I watched the owner walk an older male guest through his beer order when he ordered a Coors that they did not carry.) You can tell the staff here really wants to get it right, and it makes all the difference. The food is a little pricey, but man, is it good. Stick with the ribs and pulled pork, and you won't go wrong. We split the three meat, two side combo with cornbread, and we were both stuffed to the gills. It's a little noisy in here, but it's so great to see families, elderly couples, large groups, college dudes and couples all getting down on some country cooking. You get to steal away from San Francisco a little bit when you hit up this joint. It's not exactly Tennessee or Texas, but order the sweet tea and see if you don't forget that for a minute.

I've been told to give them a 4 star review because of the apology. So here's what happened: They forgot my order. Everyone else got theirs, and there I was sitting...then they forgot my corn. Then they brought my corn, but it was cold, room temperature cold. Then they forgot the cornbread for me and one other person. Then we realized they forgot my boyfriends corn but brought out one too many macaronis. I have to admit though, once I received it, the chicken was good. Nom nom good. And the mac and cheese almost met with my approval, if the mac hadn't of been so squishy. So what's up with the four stars? Well, the chef came out, explained it was only their third day of being open, and knocked 50% off our entire meal and gave us this tiger-shirmp appitizer that was pretty decent. The fact that he did that personally after the comedy of errors at our table is pretty sweet of him and shows a lot of potential for this place. Do I consider it all bbq? Not traditional bbq, no. Do I consider the food good and worth another try for the service? You betcha.

Whenever I find a flier on my windshield, I usually find the nearest trash can and get rid of it; 98% of the time the fliers are for porn, so when I saw an actual menu, I was surprised. ?And it looked good on top of that, unlike most of the other fliers. ?Brillz, I'm in. I'm not well versed in BBQ, but I was advised to try the Carolina style pulled pork sandwich. ?My boyfriend is from the South, and I have heard many times of the wonders of Carolina style nom-ness. ?The mustard, the smoked pork, the mouth orgasm. ?So when we picked up the sandwiches, I was rather disappointed. ?Is this what all the fuss is about? Apparently not. No mustard sauce and there was coleslaw on the sando. ?Is that normal? ?It didn't taste that great, and it was kinda grossly soggy. ?I feel bad because the people who work here are so nice, but they advertised a Carolina style sandwich, and it definitely was not it. ?I'll prolly come back to try the ribs or something else, but I highly advise against the pulled pork sandwich. The sweet tea was yummy though, I'll give them that.

I've been knowing about this place for a while and thought I'd give it a try one hungry day after work. Looked at the platters on the menu and saw that everything was quite pricey ($13 - $30 (for 4 different kinds of meat in your patter, expensive O_O)), first bad thing I noticed. So being as pricy as it is, I thought it better be pretty damn good. I ordered the beef brisket platter with mac n cheese and sweet potato sides from the nice bartender, and it came out in about 8 minutes. Took it home and popped it open to find that the beef brisket portion was quite small, but the sides were nice sized. Looking at the brisket it looked kinda over cooked and stiff. Took a bite and found out my theory was correct. It was not tender at all. Good thing I asked for a lot of BBQ sauce because I had to use it with every bite I took. Sad to say I ate it all because I was very hungry, otherwise I might have fed it to my dog, who might have been skeptical as well about eating it. Next the mac n cheese, it did not taste bad I have to say, but it did not taste like mac n cheese. It tasted more like a bland white sauce pasta dish with some spices in it. The macaroni was cooked perfectly though, soft and tender. The sweet potato was alright, very plain and tasted healthy. There was nothing much to it besides sweet potato in it, not like the fancy kinds with cinnamon or marshmallows in it. Last the cornbread, it was okay, kinda crispy on the outside and gooey soft on the inside, but nothing special. Was not very satisfied with this spot and probably would never come back.

All barbecue is good barbecue, and I'm not impartial. ?It's all good. This one is a little different. ?Like most SFBBQ they take a pan-American fusion approach, meaning they serve Texas style, Memphis style, etc., all with some tropical fruit in the sauce. ?The place is pretty spotless, an old drug store without much signage and the only way you know there's food inside is seeing all the people eating. The night I came the kitchen was backed up, food came out intermittently, and servers had lots of personality. ?That's okay, I wasn't in a hurry. ?Also, the music and video selection were pretty random, electronica / dance music if I recall. Well, most of the meat was well cooked and smoked, with sauce to add later. ?The sauces were good but all the meat I tried (chicken, grilled shrimp, pork ribs) was delicious as it is, so the sauce was just an afterthought. ?Collard greens were delicious, and their cornbread is a story by itself - molasses and other dark stuff, it's as dark as carrot cake. It can be either very cheap or very expensive. ?The key is, one $20-$25 plate is plenty for two people unless you're completely famished. ?So dinner for two with one big plate, an extra side, a beer, tax and tip, can come in at $40. ?That's a bargain. Bottom line, there was a lot of delicious meat for not much money. ?The meal was actually pretty memorable and I want to go back. ?I grew up eating barbecue and I think they can hold their own.

The good is this - ribs & pork were tasty, the beans were really great and I ate so much, I could've done the sound effects at the "Blazing Saddles" campfire scene myself. I've been here twice - first time, chicken was dry, ?On my second time, I told the owner and he said he would give me a chicken for free (kinda weird when I was complaining about it but hey-it's free, right?) So I thought... when the bill came, it was on there and I was in a hurry so I just paid it-which was LAME. The decor is confusing... ?a "try to be cool" bar when you walk in, then the tables seem mismatched (they do a long table with different height tables) and as for the walls, didn't like the artwork and then the open kitchen seems messy. ?Our waitress was nice (tall brunette) and she gave me a free refill on lemonade (I think they normally charge but refills for kool-aid are free). They need a make-over - maybe something as simple as ?peanut shells on the floor, a mechanical bull mounted upside down on the ceiling and a few velvet paintings of Elvis. The reason I'm giving it fours stars is I only expect so much for the service, decor, or ambiance from ANY BBQ place - it comes down to the RIBS - and they were tasty, off the bone and hot. Would I go again - yes, but will try to get my free chicken and ask not too dry.

Not the best and not the worst BBQ. I am very happy that Baby Blues BBQ has opened up in my hood and it might become a staple for take out, along with Goood Frickin' Chicken and El Gran Taco Loco (my current favs from the hood). I was excited to see this place open up and take over a location that has had nothing to offer for many years. Baby Blues is a very friendly, welcoming and cool place - ?good for take out or to dine in and have a draft beer. I opted for take out and decided to order a lot of food (just for myself) and get a good feel for the place. I think it's reasonably priced for BBQ and the 3 meals have stretched into 6, so it's pretty generous portions. The Food: 1) "Memphis Queen"- 1/2 BABY BACK RIBS, 1/2 MEMPHIS RIBS $24.95. Not my favorite BBQ ribs. The rub was good, but there was no smoky flavor at all. The meat was tender enough, but because it lacked any smokiness it seemed like they were just baked. I might not order the ribs again, and that's a big minus. Isn't BBQ supposed to be smoked? I liked the Memphis Ribs better than the Baby Back Ribs. 2) Beer braised BEEF BRISKET plate $13.95. I've never had pulled brisket before. Not what I was expecting, but I actually liked it a lot. Again, the meat is not smoked. I liked the brisket better than the ribs, and in general this is not usually my preference. 3) Marion County slow-smoked CHICKEN $14.95. Of all the meats, I liked the chicken the best. It had the most flavor and I would eat this on a semi-regular basis and it tasted the most of smoke. The portion was a half a chicken. The Sides: 1) Baked Beans: were watery and more like a cross between bean soup and baked beans. I would not order these again. I have the best recipe for baked beans and I might give it to them. These might have been vegetarian, but I'm not sure. Not a good side - a little too boring. 2) Coleslaw: OK, nothing special. I would not order this side again, since they have some sides that are fantastic. 3) Sauteed Okra: a grand slam. Not many places serve okra 'cause it's one of those challenging foods for people who didn't grow up with the stuff. I grew up eating okra (Southern parents) and I've never had it prepared like this before. Fucking awesome. It's sauteed with tomatoes and lots of vinegar. I loved this dish and hope they don't take it off the menu. 4) Mashed Sweet Potatoes: my other favorite. Simple and yummy. Much better for you than regular mashed potatoes. 5) Collard Greens: pretty good. I've never had collards done exactly like this, they weren't braised beyond recognition and had bacon and tomatoes in them. I would order this side again. 6) Chicken Smoked Rice: good, but really tasted just like Zatarains brand boxed yellow rice. I like the stuff, but it didn't taste homemade. A little junk foody, but sometimes junk foody is good. The BBQ Sauces: 1) regular BBQ sauce: very vinegary. It's tangy and sweet and makes your mouth wake up. I usually like more molasses and a thicker consistency - I'm a big fan of the Big Nates' BBQ sauce. All and all, their sauce really grew on me - it has a lot of personality. 2) Hot BBQ sauce: it's medium (not hot, just a little mouth burn) and also has a lot of personality. I feel the same way about it as I did their regular sauce - it grew on me too. Note: The corn bread is really yummy here. It's not traditional at all, but is almost like a cornmeal cake. It's got corn kernels and is very sticky. I loved it. Summary: Baby Blues BBQ gets a solid 3 stars from me. This place has it's own San Francisco Bernal Heights vibe and will do well. Next, I am looking forward to trying their BBQ seafood dishes. Wishes: I wish Baby Blues would add 2 side dishes to their menu: lima beans and braised cabbage and also use my spicy chipotle baked beans recipe.

A solid 3.5. While listening to Taylor Swift this afternoon on the radio (ok, *cough* I actually own the CD too *cough*), I had a brilliant idea to stop by Baby Blues before I headed home. I was almost on the Bridge before I made an abrupt u-turn and headed back to Cesar Chavez with "You Belong To Me" bumping the ride. SCORE, I was able to find parking in the front!!! ? I've been here several times and I really enjoyed their baby back ribs BUT today I was here for my favorite Q, their Texas-style Beef rib with 2x mac 'n cheese and corn bread. I think their beef rib is the best of the meats on their menu AND one of the best in the Bay. The beef rib is ridonkelous...the size of my forearm. Yet, it's the juiciest and most tender for a rib. I could have eaten two ribs but at $21.95 a rib, I showed some restraint. I'm also a hot sauce nut so I mixed the XXX sauce and the Ginger Tabasco sauce together and dunked the rib. Man, I was sweatin puddles but everything was good! btw, mac 'n cheese was good and their cornbread was fantastic. I had a piece hot out the oven and it was moist and tasty. I've never tried their memphis ribs, pulled pork, chicken or brisket as the beef rib is hard for me to pass up. However, I heard good things about their chicken but seriously, who comes to a BBQ for the chicken. The chicken?? pa-cock

I'm a native of the south, so I think I can judge good BBQ better than most in SF. ?I've tried a few other places in town, but somebody recently told me about Baby Blues and I had to give it a try. ?Since it's only about 3 miles from my house, I've tried it 2x now, with good results both times. The sauce is just OK. ?The Ribs are excellent... probably an 8 on a scale of 1-10. ?I'm not thrilled with the pulled pork. ?It's tasty, but just not compared to other pulled pork I've had. ?Personally I won't get it again. ?The baked beans are outstanding, since it's more of a hot three-bean salad than baked beans. ?Completely different and excellent! ?The mac and cheese is quite outstanding too. ?Not the best I've ever had, but pretty darn good. ?I've tried the collard greens as well and they're a 5 on that scale mentioned above. The best part of the meal is the cornbread. ?They should win an award for cornbread. ?It's outstanding! Oh, and the hot waitresses they have there are great too. One girl has tats all over... man is she hot, and a great personality! Overall, I like this place and intend to try other things on their menu. ?Next up, I'll try the brisket!

I can't believe this place only has 3 1/2 stars! My bf and I were going to Gorilla BBQ but we read some reviews before going and it seemed really hit or miss. We didn't want to drive all the way there for him to be disappointed. He had been craving bbq for forever and every time he ordered it, it didn't diminish his craving until we went to Baby Blues. We did an extensive search on Google and Yelp and it led us to Baby Blues BBQ and it was near by my house. Kinda sorta. There is plenty of street parking and we went on a Saturday afternoon. We got there at 12:30 and the place was completely empty. That kind of freaked me out. We ordered The Deuce and he got a side of 1/4 Chicken. He chose Coleslaw and Mac and Cheese for his sides. The food came out pretty fast which wasn't a huge surprise considering we were the only ones there. This was a nice sunny Saturday mind you. I love that there are four different types of sauces on every table that look home made and they have cute names like Sassy Molassey. The Deuce came with 6 BBQ shrimp with some sauce drizzled over it. I took a bite and bam, an explosion of flavor. It was soooo good. I couldn't believe it. These were jumbo meaty shrimps too. Nomnomnom. The mac and cheese looked disgusting but I couldn't stop eating it once I started! I almost didn't eat it too. The sauce wasn't really a sauce. It was just lots of melted cheese so it was really thick (and awesome). The coleslaw had a really strange taste that I couldn't put my finger on. My bf thinks it was mustard seed. It was good though. It also came with a huge slab of corn bread which I thought was just okay. I really only like super sweet corn cakes but my bf liked it. I can't say anything about the meat. I think my bf said it was kind of over cooked or something. He didn't finish all his chicken. The food is a little pricey but the 1/4 chicken is only 4.95 for some reason which is super cheap and the size was huge! You could definitely make a meal out of just that. We didn't eat any dessert because we were stuffed and had to go to dinner later that night for my friends birthday at Esperpento (horrible btw, don't go!). The decor was amazing! I loved it. Great job on mixing western and modern. I've never seen anything like it before. Even the bathroom was nicely decorated and clean. Service was nice. I was surprised to see it was a hispanic run place. Pretty impressive. We didn't notice till after that they have a bunch of lunch specials that all the other patrons who finally came in later ordered. Its on the back of their menu and they are pretty reasonably priced. I think they were around $11.95. I asked for a take out menu but the owner (?) said they didn't have any because they're redoing ?their menu and are reprinting menus. Eek! I hope they don't make any negative changes. I'll definitely be back. I didn't get a chance to really look at the menu since I was there primarily so my bf could finally get his bbq fix. Update 6/18/10 I came here last night with my cousin and my bf at about 10 (they close at 11 on Friday nights). I was surprised to see it was pretty full but there were still two tables open so there wasn't a wait. I ordered the shrimp po boy for the cheap price of $8.50 but it wasn't very good. It was just shrimp topped with not enough cole slaw between some old stale roll. Homph.

This place is so weird it's awesome. There was some kind of hoedown going on when we walked in and the crowd was all riled up. The service was spectacular. We chatted it up with the hostess who actually gave me a hug after seeing us to our table. The waitress sat down with us to answer some of our questions and the owner came out to chat it up with us after our meal. Oh..and the waitress gave us a free sampling of all the desserts. How can you not love them? Which brings me around to the food: Minuses - The pork was ok and the beef shank was decent but not great. Of the desserts most were ok. Pluses - The short ribs. Oh my god. My mouth's starting to water just thinking about it. They were absolute heaven. If you like ribs you absolutely must try this place. Also the pecan pie is un-f*cking-unbelievable. Overall, the ambiance is fun and festive, the service is spectacular, and the food, while hit or miss, can be fantastic if you know what to order. Know that, and you're going to have a great night here. Glad to see this place up and running. Good luck guys!

TEXAS REPRESENT!!!! HOOK' EM!! coming from a true texan....WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! Sunday afternoon, we stroll in there looking for some good 'ole bbq....we sit and order. um. 10 min passes. 15 min passes. 20 min passes. WHERE IS OUR FOOD? THIS IS BBQ FOLKS! the meat should already be in the smoker ready to go! all you have to do is slice it, put it in between two slices of bread and there you go. DONE. but ..... im sitting here sipping on my NASTY SWEET TEA that tastes like SOAP. (i actually couldn't force myself to drink any more of that gross stuff...and asked for a lemonade instead) and then after 30min....THIRTY MIN?!?!? our food comes out. Brisket Sandwish: where's the brisket? this isn't slice TX style brisket folks. this is shredded beef....on top of a chiabatta bread? WTF? this is blasphemy. brisket sammies go on top of rolls or sliced white bread NOT chewy chiabatta bread...NOT HAPPY! mashed sweet potatoes: it was whatever i got this side because i originally wanted cole slaw and he said "it already comes with it" so i ordered this instead. there was no side of cole slaw that came with my sandwich....STRIKE TWO! mac & cheese: why is my mac and cheese COLD? not room temperature....but straight out of the fridge cold. and why is it swimming in a pool of water? ....wth? we sent it back...and they remade it. now it's in this grainy cheese sauce. why is the mac&cheese sauce GRAINY?! creamed spinach: this is NOT creamed spinach. it is simply garlic sauteed fresh spinach with a light dash of cream. NOT the traditional creamed spinach where its all creamy and mushy and yummy corn bread: DRY...DRY ....GREASY.....DRY if that makes sense all in all....NOT worth it. NOT worth $80 bucks for 3 people... ...i miss rudy's

I wanted to like this place and like it to succeed, but the BBQ here is pretty awful. ?Technically, I don't think this is actually BBQ because everything is braised in a pot or cooked in the oven or flat top stove. ?Nothing here is smoked or actually BBQ'ed by Texas, Memphis, Kansas City, or Carolina Standards. * The cornbread is really bad - dry, mealy, and lacking any flavor * The beef brisket was pulled, suggesting it was braised in a pot. Real beef Brisket is slowly smoked and sliced. ?It was not only pulled, but incredibly dry. * The sides, like the beans and Mac/Cheese, are mediocre and flavorless. ?However, they are much better than the meat or the cornbread. * The sauces were good and you need them to mask the terrible BBQ meats. Overall this is a nice place to eat with a good atmosphere, but this would never pass for real BBQ in any legitimate area. ?They have done a nice job replicating the BBQ experience and atmosphere, but not in the quality of the food. I assume the city of SF or the price of real estate does not allow them to have a real smoker and it really shows in the poor quality of the food.

Came here with 4 of my buddies so 5 total, it was packed so we sat at the bar. we should've ordered the set meal for $110 which feeds i think 6 people. we ended up ordering seperate entrees and it came out to 140 including tip. portions were decent, came with two sides i choose smoked ribs and 2 sides of okra. my friends ordered the brisket, which was shreds of meat, the taste was ok but ?was expecting it not to be like pulled pork. ordered the okra it was too sour so i didnt like it also ordred the smoked baby back, it was too burnt so after the chared part there was some tender meat to munch on. mac and cheese noodles were over cooked which was ok but there was like some kinda of bread in it or something kinda different for me Service was slow took awhile for the waitress to take our order. food took awhile to come i gave them an extra star cuz the collard greens were tasty, little sour but bearable the hot sauce was good free drink refills I will not be coming back :(

This place is a roller coaster of emotions! There was the high I felt when I found out a honest to goodness BBQ place was opening blocks away from my house. There was the low I felt when I would walk by the storefront for many weeks only to see that the place wasn't yet open. There was the joy of seeing the first reviews proving the place had opened, dampened by the mix of praise and complaint. By the time I finally got to eat at this place, I didn't know what to expect. ?The food was excellent. ?Best ribs I've had in quite some time. ?Brisket was not was I expected; it was more like pulled pork than the slab type brisket I've had in the past and it needed lots of additional hot sauce. ?The sides, however, were amazing. ?I could eat the cole slaw every day, and the corn bread is worth waiting for. The service was a bit slow as they seemed to be short handed on a Sunday afternoon. ?Prices were pretty steep. ?But definitely the best BBQ I've had so far in SF. This is one of the few places I'll miss when I move from my current place.

Let me preface my thoughts by saying that I'm a real barbecue aficionado. ?I have a mild obsession with good barbecue; in fact, I ordered the June 2008 issue of Texas Monthly (which ranks the best barbecue joints in Texas) and am going on a barbecue journey through rural Texas next month. ?I realize Baby Blues bills itself as North Carolina barbecue, but I'm familiar enough with both styles to be able to write intelligently. The problem with barbecue in San Francisco is that no restaurants are serious enough about the meat to use a pit smoker rather than one of those generic commercial smokers. ?Notice that every well-regarded barbecue joint in the South pit smokes the barbecue. ?Being a NC/TX barbecue snob when eating in CA isn't about putting on airs--there are real, tangible, substantive differences in the quality of the meat and the preparation. ?Seeing the commercial smoker when I walked into Baby Blues was an immediate point against. Now to the food. ?Baby Blues has its strengths and weaknesses. ?I compare it most directly to Memphis Minnie's, which I believe to be the only decent barbecue restaurant in the city (Bo's in Lafayette is good but quite a drive). ?I don't think Baby Blues compares favorably to Minnie's. ?The brisket (braised--most serious barbecue restaurants serve it sliced) is absolutely drenched in sauce. ?Good brisket doesn't need to be served in a soup of barbecue sauce. ?Makes it impossible to taste the flavor of the meat, which is the entire brisket experience. ?Minnie's brisket, while sometimes a little too dry (but generally excellent), earns a huge win when compared to Baby Blues. ? Minnie's sausage also wins. ?This may be my personal preference only--I like Czech sausage, not the links that Baby Blues serves. ? Baby Blues may have a slight advantage on the ribs front. ?The ribs (I tried both the Memphis style and the baby backs) are pretty good--juicy, though in smaller sizes and portions than Minnie's. ? The sides at Baby Blues are good. ?Good cornbread and good creamed spinach. ?The mac n cheese is identical to Minnie's, which makes me think they just use the same distributor. ? The service was also good. ?This is sometimes a complaint of mine at Minnie's--they can be rude and dismissive, especially when busy. ?At Baby Blues, the waiter and his young son (I think it was his son) were both very nice and asked what dishes I liked and didn't like--good form for a new business. In the end, because quality of meat and preparation trump all other factors, Memphis Minnie's retains its spot on top. ?Baby Blues isn't that far behind, though--and if you like ribs, I recommend it.

When we walked in it didn't smell like BBQ at all -- a bad sign. Later when we got our food our suspicions were confirmed as it was obvious that our ribs were cooked a while earlier and simply heated up. I realize that ribs take a long time to cook but I have seen other restaurants manage this more effectively either through pre-baking the ribs and then grilling to order or keeping a steady stream of fresh ribs coming off the grill. Perhaps it was bad timing as we came for an early dinner around 5pm. While the ribs would probably be 4+ stars if they were fresh, the sides were terrible. All of them. I ate some congealed, bland mac and cheese with below average coleslaw and cornbread. The cornbread was served cold with no butter. Weak. My quest for great BBQ in San Francisco continues.

Great food at decent prices. I can have a tasty, satisfying meal here without my bank account feeling sad afterward. Nice artwork on the walls. Good atmosphere. I really like the vibe of the place. I wouldn't necessarily call it a "family restaurant," but I feel comfortable bringing my one-year-old in. Next time my parents and in-laws visit, we're definitely coming here. Last time I dined in, they were out of mac n cheese (everything happens for a reason, right?). Hubs decided that he'd get the mashed potatoes instead. If they hadn't been out of mac n cheese, then we'd miss out on the deliciousness of their mashed potatoes. We even ordered some to take home. :)

Soooo.... I feel this is a cool spot when you're out late, need a place to hang out with a group of friends, eat and throw back a couple of beers or drinks. In terms of the actual food though.... I had the baby back ribs. They weren't bad but not good enough for me to get them again. The bbq sauce is. But crazy expensive for the entree. $19.95 for about 6 ribs, 2 sides and corn bread. The real story is with the sides which were below average ranging to horrible. See below: Mashed sweet potatoes - There was some weird tangy taste in them. I have no idea what that was about. But they pretty much sucked. Greens - I don't know if they are trying to be creative or what. But was there some sort of stewed tomato in this or something. Just random. Cornbread - ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. Some crazy concoction of raisin, light brown colored oatmeal cornmeal mess. I had a small taste as just the sight of this paperweight was enough to turn one off. Maybe I should have stuck with burger and fries...that's what one friend did and suggested. I'll probably be back just because I have friends that live a block away and when it's 10pm and you need something to eat...yeah well...you know how it goes.

Attended an excellent baby shower that was catered by these folks (I am lucky to know such people). ?Really fantastic bbq, a bit on the well done side which is exactly how I like things. ?Thinking back I can't believe that I sampled so many things and still didn't get to everything. The brisket and pulled pork were good, but the ribs (baby back) and chicken quarters were out of control good. ?Sides were distinctive and well executed. ?The beans seemed like a three (or more) bean blend that was not cooked down to mush, but were still tender and rich. ?Potato salad was chunky and light with lovely skin on reds. ?I prefer a heavier, sweeter style, though I realize that's probably a little bit trashy of me. Corn bread! ?Pure gooey, buttery, pudding like heaven. Would love to check this place out at the source, but catering was a great intro.

Save your money. Seriously. And if you don't choose to heed my advice, I suggest you take a spit shield and boxing gloves with you because apparently the owner likes to get wasted and scream at his employees. We brought an out of town friend here, and while he brushed off the fact that his Side Car had someone's hair in it and was cold, it didn't help that the owner was giving him sleazy looks the entire time we were there...and we're gonna just assume it wasn't because he's gay. But like 45 minutes later, he proceeded to get in to an obviously gay employees face and literally SPIT in her face and fire her in front of the entire restaurant. One little girl even started crying and employees had to intervene because he was scaring customers. I have to say our experience there was scary, at best. Just be careful if you go. And stay clear of the owner if you're gay.

I live up the hill and have been waiting for this location to turn into something for nearly two years. Thankfully, it finally has.... and it looks like the kind of business that will stick around. I say that still not having been in there, but we did have an opportunity for delivery service last night. (This after the mildly disappointing experience of trying to call for delivery on Thursday and learning there was a $20 minimum for delivery. Too steep for one person, easily achieved with more. FYI). We ordered the Blue Devil - are these guys Dukies? - and were quite pleased. Four meats and three sides (and an extra side of cornbread for my Southern girlfriend) for about $45 delivered, and we absolutely demolished the food. The meats - pulled pork, chicken, beef brisket, and ribs - were excellent, and the sides - mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach - were all good, in that order of personal preference. Delivery was nice and fast and the overall experience was pleasant, and I can't wait to check this place out in person for even more bbq deliciousness.

I was immediately turned off upon entry after some tall drunk douchebag who was out with "his boyz" made some patronizing remark to my girlfriend. I spent the rest of the evening conjuring up ways to stab him to death in the bathroom without anyone noticing, or at least punch him in the face and leave unscathed. Unfortunately, Mr. Frat Boy left unharmed. The ribs I had were rather tasty, but half of what my girlfriend ordered was cold (as in, not even luke warm). The warm food did taste pretty good, for what it's worth. Not hating, but after everything that went on here and the douchebag clientele, I think I might just stick with the McRib.

Three ?words : Happy Food Coma ! Its hard to find GOOD bbq nowadays! Got this delivered with a friend. 1. beef brisket and pulled pork sammies were delicious! 2. mac and cheese ADDICTING! 3. blue cheese corn on the cob ..ARE you effing serious!?! YUM 4. baked beans were sooo flavorful. Overall I was impressed, I haven't tasted bbq that good in years. Things are usually different when you eat at a place, to when you do take out, a lot of places aren't consistant, but for what I was expecting as far as DELIVERY.... A+ I plan to go back this week ;)

This place is pretty good actually; I lived in SF for about three years and had always intended on going to this place and had never gotten around to coming here until I was here this week for a visit. They have a decent lunch special with a sandwich and one side for about an average $12-$15. I got the pulled pork sammich, and so you know, its a dry rub and they've got four sauces. Make sure they tell you the different ones so you know the levels of spiciness ;)The mac and cheese is super ono. ?But I still wish the sauces were more saucey...and less tabasco-like. ? Service was good, and she was really friendly and accommodating with an additional to go order. Overall pretty decent place.

3.5 rounded up to 4. A friend and I called in take a out order from here tonight. We ordered FAR too much food. When I called up, the woman who took my call was helpful and the food was ready when she said it would be. When I went in to pick up the food, I noticed that the decor was lacking and pretty minimal. The place has a bar but it is quite bland and devoid of decoration. And, the place was fairly filled with smoke from the open kitchen. We ordered the pulled pork plate and the Three Kings (ribs, brisket and 1/4 chicken (thigh & leg)). The pork was really good. Very juicy and tender. The ribs were great albeit a bit charred but really tasty and quality meat. The brisket was fair. It was pulled and I prefer it sliced. I did not try the chicken as I try to stay clear of dark meat chicken. Each plate came with two sides. They sides are mongo! I know some people have complained that their prices are fairly high here. But, these sides are like meals in themselves. You'll definitely have leftovers. So, think of it as two meals in one. My friend liked his Mac & cheese and his pork and beans were great. Totally a meal unto itself. I had the mashed sweet potatoes. Quite thick and tasty. The container must've weighed at least 1/3 lb. I also had the smoked rice which had good flavor but was a little dry. Each plate also comes with a nice sized piece of tasty corny corn bread. All in all, I'm glad I tried it and I'll try it again to see if this place is really a three or a four.

I'm an Okie -- a southeastern Okie to be precise (nestled in that corner of Oklahoma that borders Texas and Arkansas for those of you geographically challenged folk) -- and we do love our BBQ. ?When I saw work being done on Baby Blues, I was intrigued... when I realized it was going to be a BBQ joint, I darn near piddled myself. ?I only live two blocks away!!! ?BBQ IN MY HOOD! SO, finally, one recent rainy night, I convinced my partner it was time to give them a try (he's a Bostonian... BBQ isn't his thing). ?First off, let me just say that the hostess there was SO very sweet and fun. ?She was warm and informative and knew what she was talking about (a rarity in the biz lately). ?Cute as a button, to boot! ?...And then my food came out... ?I haven't been so jazzed about a meal in a while, truly. ?Blackened catfish, collard greens, mashed sweet potatoes and cornbread. ? Catfish -- PERFECT... so flavorful and moist and... and... perfect.. Collard greens -- I'm drooling now just thinking about it... big chunks of bacon... greens cooked just right... all sitting in a tangy sauce... Taters -- I actually licked the container... Cornbread -- moist and chunky... (those of you who know OKIE cornbread, you realize that we have a tendency to be a bit WT, so OUR cornbread is typically from a box and perfectly square, etc.)... It's awesome to have cornbread the way it was truly MEANT to be. I can't wait for my next meal there. ?With that place just around the corner, I can guarantee my ever-growing-arse will be a fixture there -- like the cornbread and collard greens. Go now... Seriously... Go... ?Mission and Precita... go... now...

Overall: UNEVEN Baby Back Ribs: Excellent: tender, still warm when delivered to the house, well seasoned. Beef Brisket: DISGUSTING! I don't know what the reviewers below are talking about when they rave about liking the brisket. What we got was stringy (like pulled pork style), DRY, overcooked beef that tasted like it had been cooked last week and reheated. It was SWIMMING in this horrid inedible red watery red soup that tasted vaguely of tobasco sauce (is this supposed to be BBQ sauce?). INEDIBLE. We threw away the entire 1 lb order. That was sad. Creamed Spinach: GROSS! Watery, overly garlicky, stringy. This one should be pretty basic and I'm surprised they messed it up so badly. Mashed Sweet Potatoes: Really sweet, but pretty darn good Pork and Beans: Seriously the best I've ever tasted: three kinds of beans, delicious braised pork on top, seasoned just right: a little spicy and slightly sweet. We'll try it again and come back for the ribs and the pork and beans, but when you go there, be prepared for anything. I'm not sure this place is very consistent, based on reading all the different reviews.

By way of background, I am a BBQ fanatic. ?I moved to the Bay Area five years ago from a state that prides itself on pulled pork, and have been searching for a truly suitable option around here since then. Baby Blues is the only BBQ joint in the Bay Area that meets my standards. Check out their ribs... new recipe; fall-off-the-bone goodness. ?Definitely the best beef rib around.

I've had the pleasure of experiencing both Baby Blues BBQ through delivery and in house dining. ?Both experiences get 5 stars. ? What spurred me to write this review was my recent delivery order. ?Me and my roommates ordered the Blue Devil Plate, which consists of 4 meats of your choice and 3 sides. ?The order was delivered in less than 20 minutes, but we soon realized that we were missing the Baby Back Ribs. ?I called in to confirm that I had ordered the right plate, and the server who took my order originally apologized for the mistake. ?Within 10 minutes the delivery guy came back with our Ribs and 2 pieces of pecan pie + banana mousse tart thingie as a sweet way of saying sorry. ?Amazing. ?Thumbs up for these guys.

Nomnomnomnom! I died and went to BBQ heaven. Really, No really... I have tried nearly ALL BBQ joints in SF and I'm in love with this place. Best BBQ in Sf. (I live in Oakland now, & Phat Matt's BBQ is def the best BBQ in Oak. Diff recipe, diff vibe so you can't compare the two. Just love em both equally, like your children.) Anyhow- eeEverything's delicious. Altho, I have yet to try everything. What a great place, great vibe, decor, friendly/prompt service! So great. I came here twice in one week. First time w/a gang of co-workers. About 20 of us? More or less. Either way, there was TONS of food and TONS of leftovers. 2nd time, I HAD to take my 12 & 8 yr old. They grubbed hard. `Lil girl had BBQ sauce and mac n cheese all over her mouf & some made it's way onto her shirt, but she didn't care. In fact she just licked it off her shirt. No sauce goes to waste! My son was so quiet when he was chowin down on em ribs, you know he was gettin down to business. ? I love the fact that ALL the BEERS on tap are ALL my FAVOURITE! But it kinda sucks because I kind of stopped drinking beer! haha. Thank you Gramma and Grampa- I feel you have something to do with this place. Took me here as a little girl when you watched over me. Pickin' up your prescriptions & buying me candy from this place that was once a drugstore, in the area of SF where I was born and raised. And now it's a BBQ joint that I love! How freakin-frackin cool is that!? :))

While in the area, I picked up a "Lasker Burger" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_) for a weekday lunch at the office. ?While there, I also ordered a Chicken Smoked Rice side (http://www.yelp.com/biz_) to take home. ?My burger was cooked a perfect medium (http://www.yelp.com/biz_) especially considering that the meat patty mix included blue cheese; rather than pile on the slaw topping, I ate the cole slaw (http://www.yelp.com/biz_) as a separate side dish (not a fan of soggy bread). This burger ranks in my tier #2 of burgers as the meat taste was strong and the blue cheese did not overpower it. Later that night, I reheated the rice which was very tasty and still firm. ?Would order this again with something with sauce to accompany next time. Overall, enjoyed the burger and the food in general. ?When in the neighborhood, it's a nice option, but their BBQ just doesn't quite tickle my fancy.

So I went by on what was supposedly opening day, they gave us a take out menu and sent us on our way telling us that we should come back after 5. I called that night to see if they would deliver (the menu says they wil) and no answer. ?I've also called back every night since then and it's always the default voicemail message. ?I just want some confirmation that they ever plan on serving food to the general populace. ?I really want to have a good (or really let's be honest, even a halfway to decent ) BBQ place in SF that delivers ( i loved Big Nates until that little food poisoning incident...). ?Bonus points for being in my hood. I plead with you Baby Blues, let us love you! ?Please open your delicious meat filled doors, pick up your phone or at least record a message letting me know that you are for real! --- Update (2008/12/21): Ok, bumping to 3 stars, i'd say 3.5 if I could. The cool folks at Baby Blues emailed apologizing and saying that they'd be open on Saturday as well as answering the phone. ?I verified by calling and asking if they were open, an actual human answered and said yup, and so headed down the hill. We walked right in and sat down, even with a stroller it was easy to find a place, I think there were maybe 4 other tables occupied. ? It's still very rough. ?There was some welding and grinding going on for the first 10-15 minutes we were there but once that was done things settled down to a nice quiet level of noise. ?The wait staff were obviously still trying to get the hang of things but were very friendly. ?I think the guy that took our order is one of the owners (?) and told us that once they get more smokers in the place should be running a bit smother. ?He also told us that he wasn't happy with the current potato salad recipe so they weren't currently serving it. Ok, enough about the place, let's talk food! Cornbread that comes with every plate, awesome! ?It's almost corn pudding, really good stuff with corn kernels right in it. Mashed sweet potatoes, wow! ?these could be a dessert and a damn fine one at that. The cole slaw was tasty, no mayo ( as god intended! ). The pecan pie as suggested by another poster was awesome, make sure to save room for it. Now with all this goodness there was only 1 thing that wasn't great. ?We split a "Memphis Queen", 1/2 rack of Baby Back ribs and 1/2 of Memphis style. ?They were ok. ?The meat was nice and moist in the middle but pretty dry and kinda tough toward the ends. ?I used a fair amount of the "XXX" BBQ sauce and was generally happy with it. Like Baby B. said, they're still a work in progress and it shows. ?All the sides we tried were right on, the meat could still use a little work and since this is a BBQ place that's what we're all after, right? ?I'm planning on going back and could see placing the occasional phone order for delivery ( should be starting shortly ). ?It's not beating out my current SF BBQ ave Memphis Minnies but it'll do in a pinch. ?Next time I'll be sure to try something other than ribs. ?I'm excited to try a pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw. My wife also suggested adding a kid changing table in the bathroom. Added pics of the inside and some of the food, check it out for yourself.

Received an ambiguous update from a friend that there was good BBQ around my neighborhood, but had to call to actually get the name. ?It was kind of iffy, considering the french accent of the girl that took our take-out order, but once we got this home (mashed, mac'n'cheese, pork, and some baby-back ribs, and we got some rolls also), all doubts were assuaged, because this was pretty frickin' good. ?Didn't even have enough time to finish a beer before our food was ready to go. ?I'll be adding this to my regular comfort-food too-lazy-to-cook cycle.

Since the word hit the street that this would be barbecue mere stumbling distance from my place, I've been counting the moments until I could stuff my face with carcass. Finally I got some take-out to tuck into with the missus. The food did not disappoint. The pork ribs and brisket were delicious. Tender, flavorful, and moist. I fancied the XXX sauce and it was spicy and sweet and wonderful. By way of sides, we shared the mashed sweet potatoes, creamed spinach, pork n beans, and okra. They were all good, but the okra stood out as especially fantastic. And the corn bread was something special too. I had a couple of gripes about the service on the pickup of my order (my bill was wrong and they forgot something I had to ask for), but I'll cut them some slack and hope it subsides as they figure out how to be a restaurant. My main complaint was that we ordered the key lime pie for dessert and the $5 portion was TEENY TINY. Tasty, but not a remotely respectable portion. Ergo, I'll be going back, and probably often to partake of the wholesome taste of slaughter, and pass on dessert.

Having grown up in east Texas, and being a huge fan of real slow-smoked BBQ, I've seen a few legitimate BBQ joints in my day. ?Unfortunately, this isn't one of them. ?There is nothing authenticly BBQ about this place. ?That's not to say that the food's not good. ?It can be, depending on what you order. ?The best thing I've had is the shrimp po-boy, which is delicious. ?The hamburger is also excellent -- they mix gorgonzola and bacon into the meet while pattying it, then grill it perfectly with a cruchy exterior and juicy interior. ?The buns are particularly good. ? The sweet tea, made with brown sugar, is also a nice twist. ?On these items alone, they earn 3 stars. ?This is a good meal. But that ain't real BBQ. ?It takes more than frozen shrimp, hamburger, and sweet tea to call yourself an authentic BBQ joint. ?That's especially true considering that the more traditional BBQ items I've tried havn't been all that good. ?The pulled pork, chicken, and brisket were all dry and not very tasty. ?They needed tons of the housemade XXX sauce (which was nice and spicy) to give them any flavor. ?The collard greens were an odd grey/greenish color and were flavorless and watery. ?And whoever calls this the best mac-and-cheese of their life is, well, clearly not from the South. ?This mac-and-cheese was nasty and curdled and the elbow macaronis are way over-cooked and mushy. ?I've tried it twice now to be sure, and I sent it back the second time it was so bad. ? Go for the burger or the po-boy...and get some sweet tea...then walk over to Humphrey Slocumbe for some outrageous small batch ice cream!

YOU NEED TO ORDER THE RIGHT ITEMS AT BABY BLUES BBQ IF YOU WANT A 5 STAR MEAL, OTHERWISE YOU MAY BE DISAPPOINTED!!! ? Ive made 3 visits to Baby Blues over the past month, sampling their various items. ?Some are true 5 star items, the best BBQ items in the bay area...but other items are just not that good...not even 2 stars, so meat selection is CRUCIAL. ? Since my taste will differ from yours, I recommend you sample several meats and decide what you like best. ?But heres my ratings: BEEF BRISKET AND PULLED PORK - 2 stars. ?Youre probably wondering how I could give a BBQ place a 5 star rating if their brisket and pork rank so low...well just keep reading! ?These meats were really disappointing and I would probably not get them again. ?You can get much better at Memphis Minnie's or Roadside BBQ. ? BEEF RIBS ?- 4 stars. ?Now were talking. ?Super meaty, not too dry, a bit fatty but oh so delicious. ?Better than the other SF BBQs. CHICKEN, SHRIMP AND BABY BACK RIBS - all 5 stars. ?The BEST in the bay, no comparison. ? other BBQ places dont even offer shrimp, but these are juicy, huge and delicious and oh so flavorful. Still waiting to try the sausage and spare ribs on my next visit. While I should really take off a star for having such disappointing brisket and pulled pork, side dishes that are so-so (none of them excite me and Ive tried the corn, mac and cheese, beans etc) and somewhat high prices for a BBQ place, their stellar chicken, ribs and shrimp completely make up for it and then some. ?Find the items you love at Baby Blues and stick to them, and you too will have a 5 star meal.

I've been meaning to eat here ever since I saw this on Food Network's "Diners, Drive-in's and Dives." ?My company has an office on the same block, so I figured I would have lunch the next time I was on assignment there. ?Today was my day, though I got to that location late. ?Since all of my co-workers had already eaten, I walked in by myself for a power lunch. Since it was already past 1:30 today, the place was about half full. ?I sat down at an empty table, and a waiter gave me a glass of water and a menu. ?I ordered one of the lunch specials and a soda. The Cherokee Spike (the special I ordered) consists of a large portion of pulled pork, another large portion of beef brisket (pulled), and one smoked link. ?On the table, were a selection of sauces, which the waiter described to me. The pulled pork was tasty, with just a little bit of juice. ?It paired well with the apple cider vinegar. ?The brisket was also very good, especially with the mild BBQ sauce. ?But, surprisingly, my favorite meat was the smoked link. ?It had just enough spice to give it a kick, but not enough to make me gasp for water. ?And the skin had a great snap when I bit into it! ? Along with all this, the plate came with a piece of cornbread and one side of my choice, which, in this case, was the Blues on the Cob. ?The corn was grilled, sprinkled with Parmasian cheese and served with a lime wedge. ?While not my first choice on how to serve corn, it was tasty. All in all, I enjoyed my meal, even though it was a little rushed. ?The next time I come in, I'll enjoy a nice, slow dinner, and probably order a Texas-style beef rib.

It was a good new year's eve dinner. ?They have tiny guitars and lots of side dishes. ?The slow cooked chicken, dark meat was tasty. ?The white meat was rather dry. The charred skin of the chicken was flavorful. ?They have a nice selection of different BBQ sauces if you want to try - my favorite was the one called "molassy", because it was sweet, tangy, and reminded me of good ole faithful collie dogs. Cornbread was pretty tasty, standard oily chewy mess. ?The mashed sweet potato side was heavenly, but the okra was too garlicky for my taste. ?The okra was cooked with tomatoes and was also dry, but it's not the season, I suppose. ?Still...sigh....

Major disappointment!!! I was excited to see this restaurant ?added to http://GrubHub.com and even though there was a $3 charge for delivery I thought it was worth it. ?I placed the order and the confirmation stated the delivery time was in one hour. ?Not bad considering it was a Sunday night and I expected that would be the length of time. I ordered the "Blue Devil" - choice of four meats and three sides (Slow Smoked Chicken, Shrimp, Pork Ribs, Texas Ribs, Corn Bread, Potato Salad, Baby Blue Salad) and one piece of pie. ?This sounded like a lot of food but I was sharing with my roommate and we thought it sounded right for two people. ?We were wrong. ? I received a call 10 minutes after placing the order and was told that they had run out of corn bread (my favorite item) and I needed to make another selection. ?Not very apologetic but I thought "this stuff happens". ? The delivery arrived earlier then they stated but was missing the Texas Ribs. ?I did receive 1 burnt chicken wing with some breast meat, 5 dry grilled shrimp and 1 Beef Rib. ?(I thought when you put an "s" at the end of a word it meant "MORE THAN ONE"). ?The side dishes were all in tiny deli containers and hardly more than a few bites. I called the restaurant and it took them 20 minutes to find the original order. ?They ?determined that a mistake was made when they placed the order into the kitchen and offered to send the missing item(s) in 45 minutes. ?Dinner was over. ?They weren't apologetic or even concerned that they had ruined my dinner and the items that did arrive were overcooked and uneatable. ?I asked to speak to the manager and was told "he was working the grill and couldn't come to the phone". ?I think this restaurant should take a hard look at how they take To-Go orders and if they can't handle it then they shouldn't do it! ?Also, keep the manager managing and not cooking - I hope he is better at that. The poor food quality, slew of errors and poor customer service had firmly determined that I will never patronize this place again.

The drinks are great. ?Yummy lemonade, Kool-Aid, Blue Moon. ?That's about where the positives end. We walked in on a Wednesday around 9:00pm. ?Still semi-crowded but not bad. ?Plenty of open seating but they seemed to have a heck of a time trying to figure out where to put us. ? Food: ?I ordered a hamburger, well-done. ?"Just no pink inside," is what I say. ?It arrives and there is a charcoal crust, nearly a quarter-inch deep on all surfaces. ?I decide to be brave and take a bite. ?It was like eating a brick from the walls of Hell. ?I'm not one to complain or send back food--I'm too shy and embarassed. ?But this? ?I just couldn't do it. I call the waiter over, who takes the plate. ?The manager comes back, with the plate in hand and says something to the effect of: ?"You ordered this well done. ?If you want it cooked through, the fire is going to char it. ?It's always going to be this way." ?There I am, with my plate shoved in my face, hamburger sitting there with one bite taken out of it, and thinking to myself, "I would be embarassed to serve this." ?I simply tell her again that it is inedible but I would be happy to try something else from their menu. Beef brisket sandwich comes. ?It's ok. ?Nothing to write home about. ?Which was the guys' impression of their chicken, pork, and ribs. ?Mashed potatoes were way too chunky and came out cold--it was like eating potato salad. ?The mac&cheese wasn't bad though. Pricey. ?Bill came out to $30/pp, with each guy only getting 1 beer and then my lemonade. ?I think that's steep for BBQ, especially that far down on Mission Street. ?Oh yea, and that $30/pp was after we had them re-total the check because they charged us for extra beers never ordered. Sure, it may have been just that I was hungry coming in the door that they seemed slow. ?And anyone can write down extra drinks by accident. ?But do not shove a plate in my face that I've had to send back! ?Final straw and not going back.

I was running errands with my dude and his niece. ?His niece was asking for Popeyes chicken. ?We were not in the mood to give her fast food. So we drove around and the dude mentioned this BBQ place with the "DRUGS" sign. ?I said HUH? We went anyways, and the bartender welcomed us. ?The waiter sat us down and gave us menus. ?The choices sounded so yummy! I couldn't decide. But since we all decided to share, I let the dude and his niece pick out their choices. We order the 1/2 memphis ribs and 1/2 baby back, with beans and mashed potatoes. ?The little one order chicken with rice and mc n cheese. ?Everything came out delicious. ?The mac n cheese was a little too cheesy for my taste, and the mashed potatoes had blue chese in it, ?a little different than I expected. ?but the BBQ was really good. ?Tender meat falling off the bones, and the varieyty of BBQ sauces was perfect for all of us to try. ? The service was great and the guys were easy to talk to. ?Overall a great experience, I do wish I had traditional mashed potatoes and creamy mac m cheese. ?The dude's beer was small and for $6 bucks... kinda pricey for tap.

Solid Solid Solid. Ribs fell of the bone. The baked beans were full of flavor....both BBQ sauces (regular and XXX) were yummmy, they have Blue Moon beer and the service was on it!

Upon entering, I realized that this restaurant is suffering from an identity crisis... is it an upscale gallery with paintings displayed on stark, grey walls that make the place feel very large but empty at the same time... or is it a family restaurant in the midst of a remodel with its mess of mismatched furniture, awkward plastic bottles on tables, and clutter in the corners? They really need to redecorate that place. I ordered the pulled pork platter with greens and creamed spinach. It was kind of cold when I got it, which was disappointing. The pork was really tender (very nice!), but wasn't seasoned, so you have to add some of their hot sauce. The greens were cooked with tomatoes, I think, which I'm not used to... usually greens are slow cooked with a hamhock. The creamed spinach was not appealing at all... it was cold, which just accentuated how watery and non-creamy it really was ...did they not drain it properly before adding "cream"? They didn't cut the spinach into small enough pieces so it had the texture of cold, lumpy slime. Eww! The cornbread was cold and nothing special. However, the Fat Tire they poured me was perfect. Good job, bartender! I live in the Outer Richmond, so I won't be coming across town to visit this place. I live near Hard Knox, which is far better, I think.

I knew I was in for a surprise when the two people behind the bar were too busy sex ting each other instead of taking my order. Luckily I was on an extended lunch break that didn't require speedy service. When the employees finally got away from their social media and served my sandwich, I then proceeded to pour BBQ sauce on it to prevent the severe dryness the meat exhibited. This was only able to occur after I pestered the socialites behind the bar for some extra BBQ sauce because all the others were empty. Maybe next time will be better.

One of the times I ate here (well, had it delivered), my chicken was so undercooked that it was pinkish-purplish inside, which scared me a bit. The other time, it was just as flavorless, but beige-pink instead of purple. The brisket is pretty dry, as well. Lackluster sides, watery and vinegar-rich sauce, flavorless meat. It ain't BBQ if it's oven-cooked, folks. There's no meaty smokiness to any of their dishes. I know that everyone talks about how their cornbread is "how cornbread is supposed to be", but it's a tad undercooked IMHO and uses WAY too much oil. If you're looking for BBQ, go for Big Nate's or... well... ANYWHERE but this place! It's too late for me - save yourself!!! Not a fan at all. Will not ingest again.

This place was unfortunately disappointing. ?First of all to call it BBQ is not accurate since the meat is not actually BBQed. ?Cooking the meat in the oven is not the same as BBQ. ?The pulled pork had a good, tender, and juicy texture, but the flavor was rather bland since it wasn't smoked and therefore didn't have any smokey flavor. ?The same goes for the ribs. Of the fixin's we had, the cole slaw and mac and cheese were really good. The collards tasted like sweet and sour cabbage. They were cooked in some kind of tomato-based sauce and left my North Carolina bred husband very confused and disappointed. ?The baked beans were also a bit disappointing since they had like 5 different kind of beans including black beans, which do not belong in baked beans. ?The flavor of the baked beans was good, but the competing texture of all of those beans didn't help. ?I was not crazy about the cornbread and found it to be a bit overcooked. I like the whole corn kernels in there and the flavor was pretty good, but again it was overcooked. I had the peach betty for dessert and I liked it, but my husband thought it was too heavy on the nutmeg. ?After, I wished I had tried the banana pudding. This is one of the few places you can find sweet tea in the city, but frankly, it wasn't sweet enough. If you have been to the south and know what BBQ tastes like down there, this place doesn't cut it. ?With some of the other places in the city, I don't think we'll be going there again.

When first approaching, I knew this place was a bit pricey. Let me tell you, with the portions of the food, its WELL WORTH YOUR MONEY. It was delicious!! although the baby back ribs were a little on tough side the with the taste of only brown sugar, their four sauces made it worth while! The memphis ribs were BEYOND tender and flavorful. and OMG THE SIDES WERE HEAVEN!! To no surprise, my bill racked up to a ,worth while, 65$ for two ppl. Thank god, it was payday for my boyfriend (: Update: I've went there recently and it wasn't as good as it was when I first had it. The ribs were slightly dry, but still delicious. It might've been picky just cus I didn't have a big appetite.

The lunch meals are a good deal. ?For under $15, you can stuff your face full of BBQ ribs, cornbread, and a side. ?The sauces give it a nice kick of flavor and you'll be licking your finger tips because of all the sauce. ? Why did I give it 2 stars you ask? ?It is nearly impossible to get any service from this place. ?You basically have to seat yourself, get the menus yourself, and go up to the cashier to pay.

Fairly disappointing and a very uneven meal. ?I ordered the rib meal, which comes with ribs, 2 sides, and cornbread. ?The ribs were pretty tasty, but all of the sides were bad. ?The cornbread was really dry and lacked flavor. ?The mac and cheese was okay, but incredibly salty. ?And the mashed sweet potatoes (normally one of my favorites) was so pasty and dry that I couldn't finish it. Baby Blues has a lot to learn about good BBQ. ?The chefs should head to Fat Matt's in Atlanta and take a few lessons.

Ribs: great flavor, just enough fat and lots of juicy meat. Not fall off the bone tender, but I actually like the meat to have some texture. I would say it's the best item I've had here. Brisket: not the best I've had, though good flavor. Pulled pork: mmm....pretty dry. I tried to soak it in the BBQ sauce overnight...but it's still kinda dry and flavorless. Okra: good flavor, great texture, but it's a little bit on the heavy side. Corn bread: I know people don't really like it, but I actually enjoyed it a lot. I love the crusty top, moist middle layer with actually corns. I would like it a little sweeter and less smokey flavor (maybe because it's packed with the ribs...), but it's definitely a success. Not sure it's the best BBQ place in town, but when options are limited...it's an OK place to go.

They were just written up in the Chronicle. ?So those of you whining about the wait, not taking orders, being out of ribs: ?they are new, getting good reviews, and weren't quite ready for the hoards of people. Be happy for a successful local biz. We went Saturday and they were out of ribs - the latest batch needed another hour before they were ready. ?So we grabbed some cornbread (it's amazing!) and headed across the street to El Rio and waited. ?The people at Baby Blues are fab. ?Atmosphere is great. ?Loved the baby backs and the sides were divine - try the okra. ?And if you like blue cheese, they put in in their mac. ?The meal was $100ish for 4 people. ?Seems pretty perfect to me.

I always get the Memphis Queen platter to share with someone else. It's a heaping pile of baby back ribs and Memphis-style ribs, where all the meat falls cleanly off the bone and absolutely melts in your mouth like butter. It's so good it's getting hard for me to branch out into other menu items. I really want to try the shrimp and the pulled pork. NEXT TIME, I swear! Try the kansas-style BBQ sauce (it's vinegar based) for a sweet-tangy splash of flavor. I could eat a whole mountain of their mac n' cheese, which I think has blue cheese or swiss in it or something....there's definitely some that makes you go "What IS that on my tongue?!" in a good way, of course! Also be sure to check out their mashed sweet potato (vitamin A, guys) and creamed spinach. Oh, and wash it all down with some ice cold Shiner Bock for extra street cred. It's a hard beer to find in SF. Another thing that really sticks out in my mind is how friendly EVERYONE who works there is. From the moment you walk in, they'll greet you with smiles, and the service is fast efficient, non-intrusive, and the waitresses have really cute senses of humor. So glad this joint is near my house.

Errr, I think it said BBQ above the door. Hang on a sec, let me go look..... Yep. It says BBQ. So, where's the BBQ? I saw an oven. I saw a grill. Surely they're not slow cooking meat in the oven, then char-grilling it and calling it BBQ? Because that's how it tastes. Nice mac'n'chee though and reasonable creamed spinach. Maybe they should call themselves Baby Blues Southern Sides.

I had the BBQ chicken sandwich and the mac and cheese about two months ago. ?Since then I have been there about 5-6 times. ?Being a creature of habit, I ordered the same thing every time, so I cannot speak to everything on the menu. The price is decent--not cheap, but definitely not overpriced. The service is good--they come to your table the right amount of times and are definitely friendly and make good recommendations--i'm sticking with the chicken though. The chicken is cooked just right and the sauces there are really good. ?I mixed and matched and overloaded the sandwich with a bunch of different sauces. ?The Mac and Cheese is good, but it becomes great when you add the ginger tabasco sauce. I recommend a visit, but maybe you should be more adventurous than me and try more than just the BBQ chicken and mac and cheese.

I have been here about 5 times and each time its consistently great! The ribs, catfish and pulled pork are the best!!!! They give you 4 different sauces and my fav is the ginger vinegary kind. The sides are hard to decide. I usually go with: Pork and Beans- They use the pulled pork and its best with the chili water they give you at the table. stewed tomatoes- There's something extra special they do with the canned tomatoes that make you forgive the fact that there canned. Greens- are a must-have. There meaty and have a nice savory broth. Today I tried the pecan pie and you could tell it was not made in-house, and was a bit old. I don't think I would order it again. I will always consider this great BBQ joint when trying to figure out where to eat. side note- I'm not a fan with chain joints.. But this one does the whole "chain" vibe really well.

I have also had their pulled pork platter, which I shared with a friend because it was so much food - still delicious, though.

My favorite BBQ joint, Johnson's, happened to be closed when I got there at 8:00 pm (even though they should have been open til 9:00), so now what? ?I promised my bf I'd be back with BBQ! ?I find Baby Blues on yelp and decide to give it a try. ? YUCK! ?Since when is beef brisket pulled? ?I think they may have given me the pork instead. ?Regardless, it was dry and flavorless. ?The ribs, at first sight, were charred so black you can hardly see any rib. ?Turns out they were pretty okay and tender, but I definitely prefer saucy, drippy bbq over the dry rubbed. ?The mac and cheese was cold and hard and not cheesy at all. ?Who fucks up mac and cheese? The okra and the greens were probably the best out of the entire meal, but still didn't blow my socks off. And, last but not least, they forgot to give me my damn corn bread, and I was not about to drive my back ass over there again to look for another parking spot for 20 minutes. ? The prices, for what you get, are not cheap.

After a few failed trips, and calls that resulted in many rings with no answer I was thrilled when this place was *finally* open. I think they caught a lot of flack since their opening was prematurely broadcast all over the place (Daily Candy for sure, and I think the Chronicle as well) before it was REALLY actually open, whether that is their fault or not I cannot say. What I can say is that we got delivery. Ribs delivery... and it tasted good. For a large group of gals, Sharon M ordered the "Feed Bag" Teaser option which came with a rack of baby backs and a rack of memphis style ribs, pulled pork and a ton of sides. This was the smaller of the party options and it was plenty of food. Everyone (10 or so people) was able to have a few things and feel full, so I would recommend this as a casual catering option for your next party. I've certainly had better pulled pork, but as sauces go I enjoyed it. The baby back ribs were by far my fav. I would go back, but i've been warned by friends who've dined in to give them some time to settle in a bit more. All in all I am happy to have this as a delivery option!

As a steadfast loyalist of Big Nate's Barbeque, I have to cop to the fact that I think there is pretty much just one way to make ribs. ?But having said that, Baby Blues is definitely worth a visit. ? As a converted drugstore/converted retro curio store, it's not the most inviting space, and at our table it was dark enough so that I had to go stand under a light at the other end of the restaurant to read my menu. ?Plus, I didn't like the Led Zep they played over the sound system -- not the best for mood or for digestion. ?But the food was by and large very good. ?If you don't like eating large quantities of cheese, don't get the mac and cheese, but it was rich beyond belief. ?Many of their side dishes are also great, like the potato salad -- I could have eaten that for several hours. The beef brisket was, by the reports, really good. ?That came in a very healthy-sized portion -- as did the "Texas BBQ Special," which we had no idea what it was when we ordered it except that they were beef, and most of the other ribs they had were pork. ?Indeed, when they arrived, the Texas Specials literally dwarfed the plates they came on. ?I had no idea that ribs came in such giant, Fred Flintstone sizes - I mean, the rib bones were close to 13" x 2", so large that the ends of the bones poked out of the clamshells we took their remains home in. ?And they were so massive that it took several minutes of sawing away to separate the ribs from each other so that they could be successfully maneuvered into the mouth. ?A little chewy, but tasty as well as memorable. Plus, you gotta love a place that not only has Pabst on tap, but serves Kool-Aid on top of that.

Good BBQ is why so many Southerners believe in God. I used to live around the corner from this location, and if it was open when I lived there then I shit you not I would eat here at least 2-3 times/week. The ribs and the chicken are out of this fucking world. ?I had given up on ordering chicken at BBQ joints because more often than not it comes out too dry, but I was splitting a combo plate with my wife and she ordered it, and damn am I glad that she did. ?It was juicy, tender and cooked PERFECTLY. ?And the ribs had a delicious dry rub, which worked well with both their mild tangy sauce or their spicy sauce (both served on the side of course). Cornbread - AWESOME. Smoked Chicken Rice & mashed sweet potatoes - pretty good. Pork & Beans - not impressed. ?Too bland for me. I wasn't that impressed with the pulled pork or the brisket. ?Neither had that smoky BBQ flavor - they both seemed kind of stewed. ?The good news is that the owner/manager dude knew it and commented to us that they were trying to improve those recipes before we even had a chance to offer any feedback. Critcisms aside, this place still gets 5 stars in my book. ?Once they perfect the pulled pork then I'm going to petition Yelp to let me give it 6.

I've passed by this place so many times and wanted to try it. Finding out that they have Shiner Bock on tap sealed the deal for me: so I sauntered over there a few evenings ago. Such a let down. We ordered the "Mason Dixon" (1/2 Memphis ribs, 1/4 chicken with 2 fixins & cornbread ~ $21.50) to share. For our "fixins", we chose sauteed okra and creamed spinach. The meat was pretty good. The ribs were hearty and flavorful. The chicken was juicy but perhaps not cooked through? We weren't able to dislodge all the meat off the bones. The okra was splendid - cooked just right to still have a touch of snap and accompanied by a bit of tomato = nice and simple. The creamed spinach was mealy and inedible. It tasted heavily of raw flour... ? When the waiter came over to inquire about our level of happiness, I told him about the spinach. I mentioned that maybe they had used a roux that hadn't been browned - although I've never known of creamed spinach to have a roux, I just couldn't figure out what else it could have been - and he thanked me and said he'd let the kitchen know. And then he never came back. Never mentioned it again. My companion was still hungry so he ordered a side of macaroni & cheese ($3.50). ~ Soupy, oily, curdled. Banana pudding was gooey and delectable ($5.00) Shiner Bock was flat ($5.00 each) So, overall we were pretty disappointed. Service was spotty and inattentive. I don't understand the reasoning behind inquiring about patron's happiness about a meal if the server doesn't intend to address any complaint. I'd have rather not been asked than a false attempt at giving a shit. Dinner for two, after tip $66.00 Bummer.

Mmmmm I love BBQ. This place is alright. Not the best I've had by any means. I'd go back, and I like that they deliver so I may take advantage of that sometime. There were good points and not-so-good points. Good: The Texas style rib(s) - it's one huge beef rib. And it was soo delicious and tender. Do NOT skip this! Really good stuff. I could have just eaten this and been happy. Fresh brewed sweet tea. All of the sauces were great. Potato salad and the cole slaw was pretty damn good. Not-so-good: The service - it seemed really off ?to me. Almost like it was an afterthought. Both of the people who waited on us were sort of aloof and didn't really have it together skillfully or socially. I just know I didn't like it. The Memphis ribs - They were okay. I wouldn't get them again. I love smokey, but these were TOO smokey for me. Almost like I could taste liquid smoke. I could barely taste the pork actually. The mac n cheese - It's one of my favorite foods, and apparently they are "known for it" here. It WAS yummy, but unfortunately room temperature to almost cold, which almost killed it for me. Come to think of it, so was everything else that was supposed to be warm. I like my food hot, but was starving and nursing a hangover so I didn't have the patience to wait any longer to feed my face.

Ok... I love me some BBQ. ?This place is pretty good. ?I ordered beef brisket, pulled pork, and a 1/4 chicken. ?Every bite was fantastic. ?The cornbrean accompaniment was also very, very good. ?The additional sides were: mac and cheese, rice, and mashed potatoes. ?These were also good. ? Unfortunately... the ribs weren't as good. ?They were slightly burned. ?Now, this could have been an off night, but I would imagine that if an establishment is known for ribs, shouldn't they always be cooked well? ? The desserts were not bad, banana cream pie and kie lime pie. ? Staff was very nice and so was the chef. ? I will go back and hope that the ribs make up for what they lacked the first time. ?I will say though that the brisket and pulled pork kicked ass.

I give this place 5 stars in its class - I used to frequent memphis minnies which frankly now has gone downhill. ?Prices up, portions down, bah humbug. Enter 6 people on Friday night drinking at El Rio - "LETS GET BBQ" We wandered across the street to the giant sign that reads DRUGS over this place and ordered a package deal for 6 which included enough food for easily 10 people. pulled pork, brisket, and a ton of sides- lets do the list sweet potatoes - syrupy and delicious, collard greens - best ive had, hands down - with little chunks of bacon and a good smokey flavor the coleslaw - perfect the mac and cheese - pretty damn good, not the best I've ever had but pretty damn good the okra - +1 for even having it on the menu - delicious the baby back ribs - fall of the bone goodness the pulled pork - generous portion, tender, yummy the beef brisket - holy shit, this was my favorite, i could have eaten it all myself. creamed spinach - that's the only on the menu that didn't wow me. ?It wasn't bad, just nothing special. We left there with guts busted and happy faces with a GIANT bag of leftovers enough to feed our hangovers all saturday and sunday. ?If only my wife hadn't forgotten them at the bar. ? Doh !! Seriously though, this place rocks, and the waitresses and the staff is super friendly (and pretty cute too) ? GO GO GO

Great selection of side dishes, but that is where the complimentary portion of this review has to end, as they were all pretty (subjectively) nasty. The corn bread tops the list as the number one offender to our assaulted palates, comprising a bitter and mushy pate of ick that half of our party wouldn't even touch after the first bite, but the mashed sweet potatos were almost as bad (and maybe even a little more disturbing as I'm not quite sure what you have to do to mess up mashed sweet potatos. The potato salad and collard greens were _okay_. The ribs were somewhat subpar as well, although the sauces for them were pretty damn good... I'll have to add another star for that. Disclaimer: We ordered this as delivery from http://grubhub.com, so maybe something was lost in translation along the way, or maybe they were just having an off day at Baby Blues, but I have to call them like I see them!

What can I say...THIS place is real BBQ. From the atmosphere to the kool aid its all good. I've always passed this place and wanted to check it out...well a few weeks back I got my chance. Walking in felt like I walked into a BBQ joint in Memphis...it had that old, worn old school look to it that you would see from a place that was built in the 20' or 30's and the rest of the town was built around it. Lots of crap on the walls and huge tables where groups of 20 or so can sit. The staff was attentive even though it was busy and the food was brought out under 15 min. Oh the food....ribs so tender they fell off the bone when i picked them up, brisket the melted in my mouth with just enough fatty content to make it like butter...and the sauces...HOLY MAN they have some great BBQ sauces. I've seen some bad reviews on here and I think maybe it was just a matter of difference in taste or opinion. I'm a big BBQ guy, its a family thing and I can say that this is as close to real southern BBQ as i've had out here in a while ...give it a go...best days to go oddly enough are on the weekends.

I admit I need to give the place another attempt as I have not yer tried everything they offer. ?I did not like the Shrimp Po' Boy. ?I prefer my po-boys on a soft roll, with crystal hot sauce, lettuce and mayo. ?These were a bit too stylized. The beef brisket was not as I had hoped. ?It was just kinda watery, floppy and saucy. What I need to try are the ribs. It may simply be that the ribs are what one is supposed to eat, and therefore my review is tenative and pending re-evaluation, but at least heed this as a warning, and instead opt for the ribs if you are on teetering on the edge of indecision.

There is an old saying in the BBQ business and it goes something like this; "It ain't Done till it's Done." ?Seems rather appropriate for the boys at Blues. ?Can everyone please give them the time to do their diligence, and stop harassing. ?It's a tough, stressful business in some of the most unstable of times and we should be supporting small business owners like these. ?

No stars. This place is awful. It is overpriced and serves dried, super charred meat. The greens were awful, some kind of stewed tomato thing. And don't get me started on the cornbread, which was brown and didn't taste like cornbread at all. Most concerning was the lack of brown folks in the establishment. Not a one 'cept for yours truly. The music was deafening. I felt bad for our server. She seemed to be the only one working that night. I might go back to try a po boy, but I won't recommend this place at all for dinner.

Major plus for B.B.B. is that you can order delivery through http://Grubhub.com. Everything is just OK. Nothing has that wow factor that you want to have when you eat bbq. The cornbread wasnt bad. I think that may have been my favorite part of the whole meal, ?was dipping my cornbread in my baked beans sauce. They have mashed potatoes ?but dont have gravy. You CANT do that! It's just wrong. Wasnt too pricey, they have great portions and lots of sides to choose from. FOLLOW UP: ~20 minutes after eating, I started feeling that dreadful grumbling in my tummy that one really hates. Luckily, I'm at home-alone. Otherwise I'd be embarrassed having my roomie hear me while ?writing this follow up in the loo. BOO! I guess I'll go back to N.O. for some bbq 'cause SF is not cutting it.

Finally the closest thing to REAL southern BBQ in the Bay Area The atmosphere may not say BBQ but the food talks for itself. being from the real BBG capital of the world this place rivals great Eastern North Carolina and Memphis BBQ houses. The Chef is from Durham NC and does some very interesting things with what would be called standard Southern fair. You gotta try the mac and cheese but the grilled corn with spices and parmesan cheese is both new to me and my personal fave.

More like a 4.5 After being a bit disappointed from the Chronicle's review of Bo's Barbecue in Lafayette, I decided to give the food critics at the Chron another try when it came to barbecue. ?Reading the review, I felt a slight bit an elitist foodie's disdain. ?That was in contrast to the review for Bo's where it was quite glowing, so glowing that Bo's is on the Chronicle 100. ?Perhaps this place would be good because the Chronicle didn't absolutely love this place. The pulled pork was among the best I have ever had. ?Slow cooked in Guinness then smoked for 12 hours the flavors of the spices fully penetrated the meat. ?I'm pretty sure one of my friends from North Caroline would really appreciate the pulled pork. I wasn't too crazy about their sauces, which were vinegar based. ?The mild tasted too mild and the spicy was very hot. ?The apple cider vinegar complemented the pulled pork best. ?Ribs were a little bit overdone, but the meat fell right of the bone. ? The okra was good, but not a taste I was expecting. ?Good food, highly recommended.

Went over to a friend's place for dinner and they happened to order from Baby Blues BBQ. Hadn't heard about this place (and apparently it's a chain with a few branches in SoCal and in Philly) but it was great! The Memphis-style ribs (dry rubbed without sauce) were tender and flavorful and the chicken was pleasantly juicy as well. Not quite as impressive but still tasty were the pulled pork and beef brisket. Among the sides, especially liked the sweet potatoes and cole slaw and the cornbread. Great option for a takeout dinner!

I entered the restaurant around 7:30PM. ?The restaurant was decorated with wooden furniture with dimly lit light. ?There was a bar in the front with the Giants game on TV. ?We were sat in 5 minutes and I was beginning to pick what I wanted to eat. ?Everything sounds so good. ?They have baby back ribs, catfish, chicken, and pulled pork. ?I decided order my go to bbq item - the pulled pork plate. ?The plate comes with pulled pork two sides and a corn bread. Pulled pork was tender. ?BBQ sauce has the right amount of flavor. ?For sides I got baked beans and okra. ?Okra was chewy - love the texture. ?I like how they did not drench the meat in sauce, but the placed bottles of bbq sauce on the table instead. ?You can put however much you want. ?It was great. ?I would definitely come back here and try their ribs and texas style beef ribs.

This afternoon marked my first visit to Baby Blues BBQ. ?I read about Baby Blues in Zagat's New and Notable list prior to reading some of the reviews here on yelp. ? My first impression was that this place was LOUD and BOISTEROUS. ?I think it is the perfect atmosphere for folks looking for laughs, drinks, casual dining or a neighborhood ambiance. The downside is that it is a bit chaotic. ?We didn't know if we were required to seat ourselves or find a hostess to seat us. ?It wasn't really clear. ?For those who go there for the first time, I suggest going straight to the back to find a waitress. ?Any waitress will be able to seat you. The service was alright. The waitresses were friendly and although they were busy, they tried to ensure that we were okay on food and drinks. The boyfriend and I ordered 2 Pulled Pork platters. ?I knew that this was a risk for disappointment since I'm an Eastern NC raised girl. ?Perhaps, I should have gone with the Memphis Queen platter, as other reviewers enjoyed it. ?I really wasn't impressed with the pork. ?There was not much flavor or spice to it, like NC pulled pork bbq. ?In fact, the sauce that was suggested to us for use really didn't have the tang that I'm accustomed to using with pork bbq. ?The sides were adequately portioned, but I was a bit disappointed that they had run out of corn bread. ?The mac and cheese was alright, the chicken smoked rice was dry and bland. ?Free refills on soda and sweet iced tea (I ordered a coke, so I can't comment on the sweet tea). ?$34.60 w/tax, not included tip. All in all, I'm glad that there are choices of places to go for Southern bbq in SF, but I don't know if this would be my first choice. ?I just didn't find the pulled pork to my liking. ?To each his own, but for the food, I'd rather go to another joint in the city. Parking can be hit or miss in the area.

Can't believe I haven't already reviewed this place. ?We've been here for a sit down dinner a few times, but taken out from here many more times. Our favorites are the ribs and the brisket. If you order out, make sure you request lots of extra sauce. Their BBQ sauce is tangy and spicy--just the way I like it. We usually order a half rack of ribs and get the two sides (collard greens and mac n' cheese) which runs around $40. As for an in-house dining experience, think indoor picnic. They have long wooden tables covered in red gingham cloth. This is the perfect place for a big party. You can order a combination of their set dinners and share all the delicious bbq-y goodness. Service is pretty quick and always with a smile. Make sure you have enough wetnaps to clean your hands because that rib sauce will get everywhere. It's a bit of a trek, but if you're in the area, give Baby Blues a try!

Baby Back Ribs -- they arrive naked 'cause there's sauce on the table; I liked one, wasn't too fond of the others. The XXX is really spicy on its own, but improves upon contact with ribs. I liked their standard sauce the most (not the gingery one). Blackened Catfish -- The char was really bitter, the rest of the fish was tender and delicious. Mac and Cheese -- Cheesy, not just buttery! Mm! Collards -- Aw yeah. Have had better but a good side to heavy ribs. Some large communal raised tables with more, smaller tables in the back. It's a lot bigger than it looks from the outside. You can sit at the bar and watch the game. The help is nice, but it might be hard to get their attention if the bar is busy. I've had bbq a few other places and while it's good here, I've had better. Still, I'd come back to try other sides and meats. I'm used to my bbq coming slathered in sauce, and to be honest I like it that way, unless the meat's really good on its own. Mm... the ribs needed the sauce to be my level of tasty. Kinda on the pricey side, but at least you won't leave hungry.

I called for delivery and it took Baby Blues four minutes to tell me that they only deliver to Bernal Heights and part of the Mission. Uh... BB could have told me that on their website OR told me that on the phone before asking for my address three times. On the BB website, it states that delivery is made within a 15 minute drive of the restaurant. Per google maps, I'm 9 minutes from the restaurant.

Having been raised eating BBQ in South Carolina, Kentucky and all over the east coast, there is no way BBQ in San Francisco can be anything but slightly disappointing and I don't expect competition BBQ at a local joint but I do expect edible meat. I don't know what disappointed me the most, the crappy ribs or the ridiculous prices. The sole highlight was the texas style rib which was one huge meat bone and it was tasty! I got the Big Blue which was 25 dollars for three meats and 2 sides and it was additional 4 dollars to get the texas style ribs. The other two meats I got were the pulled pork and the brisket both of which should be fork tender and melt in your mouth. They were both really tough and it seemed like there were so many BBQ sauces to pick from to help soften up and flavour the meat. I went back again think perhaps they just got some poor meat or just rushed the smoking and cooking process but it has the same toughness. The sides were equally disappointing, the collard greens were bitter, the okra slimey and the creamed spinach was runny and all three were served cold. Combined the low quality of the food with high prices this not a place I would return for a third time. Both times we went there, there no more than a dozen people there but the service was non-existant and it was very cold inside.

I really liked the Memphis style ribs. ? ?Memphis style uses the St Louis cut rib, which cuts off the skirt. ?While some people don't like the burnt crust, I did, and the rib was very tasty. There were three of us for dinner, so we ordered a full rack of Memphis ribs to share (~$22.00). ?For my meal, I had the 3 item plate, catfish, pulled pork, beef brisket. ? ?I'm used to having the bbq beef brisket sliced whole and not pulled like the pork. ? The brisket was ok, but covered with BBQ sauce, while the pulled pork was dry. ? ?The worse part, was that I couldn't tell the difference between the two, and being a carnivore who travelled to Argentina just to eat their beef, it's not a good comment. Portions are normal sized compared to Bo's (huge declious portions) in Layfayette. I can't comment on the service, since it's just opened, and most of the people were just learning the restaurant and probably won't be there when I go back in 3 months. Of all the BBQ places we've tried, Johnson's on San Bruno Ave is still our favorite. ?Bo's is second, since it's a long drive and sometimes does not have beef ribs.

So dig this, party people: The other day I signed onto yelp and noticed I had an email from some chick named, well I can't remember her name now but the point is that she was offering me Elite '10 status! ?Fuck yeah! ?Then I realized that she had sent this email five months ago. ?I swear to G-d I didn't get the email until 5 months after she allegedly sent it. ?I wrote back, excited about getting that cool little badge by my picture, but then she said the offer had expired. ?I told her I would never join a club that would accept me as a member, then I went to Baby Blues to eat meat and cry. Gmo G. said it best--you need to know what to order. ?I personally like the beef ribs--they're seriously like those brontosaurus ribs in the opening credits of the Flintstones, and the sausage. ?Haven't tried the chicken yet--I just feel like if you're going to eat BBQ, you need to eat something that once had four legs, ya know? ?I do think that I'll go for the shrimp next time just cuz y'all seem to dig it so much. ?Also, you gotta get the right side dishes. ?The mashed sweet potatoes are like a sugary orgasm waiting to happen, and the spinach is good too (but not sugary nor orgasmic...but really people, you need to get your minds out of the gutter). ? I think of Baby Blues less as BBQ and more as comfort food. ?It really cheers you up when you've been rejected by Yelp, or a girl, or in my case, a girl from Yelp. ?I know, I know, I probably shouldn't have asked her out on that date until the third or fourth email.

All I can say is WOW! ?Just got home from stuffing my face with some really amazing BBQ! ?I've not had a lot of great experiences in SF BBQ cuisine, but this joint just blew my mind! ? Atmosphere is unassuming, even diner-esque... walk in say hello sit down and order. ?In fact, I was expecting mediocre service and food, even though the place was immaculately clean and clearly well taken care of ... boy was I surprised when the owner's daughter was my waitress! ?She knew her food, drinks and her condiments well, ?and was as friendly as one could hope. About 45 minutes into a fan-friggin-tastic meal the owner plopped down next to me to have a rib or 3 for dinner and ask me how I was liking everything. ?Just seeing how much this man LOVED his restaurant and genuinely cared about the dining experience his customers were having makes me all warm and fuzzy! My friend and I spent a modest (under $70 total) amount on dinner and I have a fridge full of left overs and a promise to go back for more! ?

Baby Blues BBQ is a difficult place to review. ? If you are looking for real southern BBQ (and by that I mean anything south of the Mason Dixon line between Texas and the Atlantic) - where the meat is slow cooked all day until it's smokey and falling off the bone tender, then Baby Blues will be a disappointment. ?' Baby Blues is more like bbq - like the kind you can do over a grill in your backyard. ?It is done pretty well but there's nothing really special about it. For the 3 of us we ordered the "Blue Devil" - 4 meat and 3 sides plate for approx $32. ?It was definitely enough food for all of us. ?Though we were greedy and also ordered half a chicken and got banana pudding for dessert. - memphis ribs and baby back ribs: although we were told that the memphis ribs were smokier and spicier than the baby back ribs and not as fatty, I honestly could barely tell the difference between them. ?I could tell they tasted different but didn't think one was smokier or spicier than the other. ?I expected to be able to figure out the baby back ribs but there was no fatty fall of the bone telltale sign for me. ?I felt like my friend makes better ribs in the oven. ?These definitely did not feel like they were cooked all day. - brisket: okay but definitely not Texas bbq - hot links: probably my favorite thing. ?I know, nothing home made or foodie but they were spicy and nicely grilled. - chicken - pretty good for bbq/grilled chicken. - mashed sweet potatoes - okay, it's difficult to go wrong with sweet potatoes - cole slaw - standard coleslaw, not too creamy - mac n' cheese - is not like any mac n' cheese I've had before. ?The macaroni had a ricotta like cheese inside it, like lasagna does. ?I kinda liked it but could understand why some people might not like it. - corn bread - tasty but it was a little hard and dry. - banana pudding - this was really good. ?I've never had any real banana pudding before (only the vanilla pudding/nilla wafer stuff) and I would get this again. I had to give Baby Blues only 2 stars because it was bbq and not BBQ. ?I mean, I've had just as good eating at friends houses. ?So though it was good I probably wouldn't come back. I will say that when I came last Tuesday at 7 for dinner the place was almost empty (probably because of the rain during the day). ?Although it filled up a little while we were there it wasn't very crowded and the food came out very fast.

Baby Blues offers good BBQ with very reasonable price. ?For a large plate of beef brisket, ribs, and 1/4 of a chicken, it's less than $25. ?And it comes with two sides of your choice and a piece of delicious corn bread. ?We got collard greens, which was juicy and tasty and slightly spicy. ?And also mashed sweet potatoes, which was delicious as well and not too sweet. ? The service was a bit erratic at first. ?Our friends' food came first and it was difficult to watch, because A. we were hungry, and B. we ordered the exact same thing so it was weird that they got theirs first. ?Turns out the duplicate order confused the kitchen and they only prepared one plate. ?After realizing it, the waitstaff and management was pretty eager to resolve the issue. ?We got two extra pieces of corn bread to hold us over until our plate came, and our plate came rather quickly. ?And on top of that, they gave us banana pudding as a complimentary dessert. ?So really great gesture on their part.

I have been craving good BBQ, which is a tough thing to find in SF. ?For whatever reason, this city is so fixated on non-meat or new age options that it forgets the value in the simple act of cooking a piece of dead animal over an flame. ?Cavemen (and cavewomen) certainly hit on a good thing when they first started doing it with mammoth and such, why not continue with what works? Previously, I had by recommended to try Memphis Minnie's, which I was told had good BBQ. ?It doesn't. ?It has awful BBQ. ?The meat is dry, but not because it has been spice-rubbed and smoked for several hours at low heat. ?It is dry because it was cooked over a gas for not too much time and barely basted in mediocre sauce. ?It isn't 'northern/Kansas' style and it isn't 'southern/Memphis' style. ?It is bad. Baby Blues is different. ?While it would never be considered world class BBQ, it is the best BBQ I've ever had in California by a good margin. ?The half slab I got was well seasoned and prepared. In the vein of Charlie Vergo's Rondezvous in Memphis, the ribs were somewhere between total dry rub and dripping is sauce. ?They hung onto the bone, but had a nice tomato-based sauce that had been slow cooked on. ?The bottled sauces were good and simple as well, mainly a thin BBQ sauce of the tomato and spices variety, and two hot sauces. Service was a little slow, which would be the one downside, but the prices were fair. ?My half slab was $11, a full slab is $21. ?With two sides and corn bread you're looking at $18. ?I'll definitely be going back, next time for pulled pork or maybe beef brisket. ?Mmm do I love BBQ and I am glad I have finally found a place the is halfway decent at doing it here!

Yes, my hood was desperately needing a new restaurant and Baby Blues BBQ is a great addition to the hood! ? I stopped in for lunch and had a grilled shrimp po'boy which was awesome! ?Perfectly seasoned shrimp topped with a freshly made cole slaw completely hit the spot along with a side of mac and cheese and I was in heaven! ?My partner ordered The Hound Dog which was Memphis style ribs and beef brisket with a side of greens. ?The meat was tender and tasty. ?The greens were perfectly cooked and were a little spicy and sweet. ?We could have easily shared her lunch, but it was the perfect amount to share:) ? We've ordered take out since our initial visit and along with the Memphis style ribs we've also tried the chicken and it was tender, moist and seasoned perfectly. ?They have great iced tea and kool-aid which makes me love this place even more! ?If you are in the hood or wanting good bbq, Baby Blues is a must stop!

THIS IS MY BBQ PLACE! I finally found a supremely badass bbq spot. And it even has SHINER! Hellz mutha-effing YEAH! I had the pulled pork, the amazing mac 'n cheese (tastes better than any in SF by far, even has a blue-cheesy finish), chicken smoked rice. Their corn bread has a great authentic texture and just sweet enough to make it perfect. DAMN! I probably won't call this Baby Blues because it has these amazing old drug store neon light signs outside. I'll be calling you either Rexal BBQ or Drug's BBQ. YUM... Now would you please open a location closer to my place?

This place is solid! ?Its got tasty bbq, good beers, and a comfortable locale. I like the people who work there - they're not trying to kiss your arse with attentiveness, but they get the job done. ? Things to try: memphis ribs, shrimp, wings, and mac-n-cheese. ?I agree they could up their game a bit on their sides, but I enjoy it nonetheless.

"It feels like i ate a donut hole the size of a volleyball'. ?-Estrada Y to the U to the MMMMM MMMMMM good. This spot is off the hook. After starting my girls birthday night off at the Argus, the 7 of us headed over to Baby Blues BBQ. Jackie our waitress (who couldn't have been nicer) suggested we got the Teaser. It consisted of no less than: a full rack of Memphis style ribs the baby back ribs a full chicken a whole pound of both pulled pork and beef brisket (soaked in Guiness, how can you go wrong), 4 sides (a pound each) and 8 pieces of cornbread. We gorged like Romans that night. We all left fat as fuck with gigantic smiles on our faces. There was barely enough room for more beer, so I had to happily stick with bourbon. Oh the sacrifices we all have to make in the name of Southern gluttony. Get a crew together, mob out and enjoy. It' worth the ride for sure.

Had the Cherokee Spike lunch special and for the second time it hasn't disappointed. What else is awesome about this place is that they have the best beers on tap and my personal fav: Trumer. And in it's custom glass. Being from Texas I've got a bias towards West Coast BBQ not being all that but Baby Blues is on the short list of exceptional BBQ. The way they serve the brisket is a little non traditional but it's probably the best meat I've tried here.

I was back at this restaurant for the second time last evening with a buddy. I love the ambiance. The staff is generally friendly and attentive. The food is alright. Maybe I just don't like dry-rub BBQ. Last night, I had the catfish. The catfish was tender and I did eat the whole thing, including the skin. It was lacking in flavor. I also had cole slaw, which was pretty good. On a prior visit, I had chicken, baby back ribs, Memphis ribs and a slew of sides. The meat were tender but still lacked flavor.

I had some leftover pulled pork, brisket and ribs with a few sides that my roommate picked up.I wasn't expecting much but I polished off all the leftover ribs and brisket. It all seemed fall off the bone tender and very tasty. The ribs were well above average for San Francisco! The sauces were good too. I will probably go back to give it a proper review but thumbs up.

I hope that you are hungry because the portions are generous. I like this place because it's good, it's cheap and we get free refills. Their sprite is actually 7Up, their waitress could be nicer but the pulled pork was delicious. I'd definitely come back. It's less crowded for lunch. Not a date spot but a great place to eat with your friends.

We got the feed bag called "The Teaser" (feeds 6-8 folks) for five adults and there was still substantial leftovers. ? The best things here are really the Memphis-Style Ribs and the fixins (sides). These ribs are the probably the best I've had in SF yet. However, the chicken was only okay, and the baby back ribs were a little too charred. I would pass on the pulled pork and the brisket. Great sauces though, and plenty spicy. The fixins were really stellar: lots of different kinds in the baked beans, great mac and cheese, and a decent cole slaw. The blues corn on the cob has some kind of cheese on it and was awesome. You could just eat the fixins and be plenty happy. The corn bread, however, is so incredibly heavy and dense that I was expecting it to collapse upon itself and form a neutron star right there at the table.

After wanting for some time to try this place we were disappointed. We tried three platters, the brisket, the pulled pork and the Memphis ribs. Of the three, the ribs were the best but still mediocre. ?The brisket, despite appearing juicy, seemed to dry up after a couple chews in your mouth. The meat overall had little to no smokiness that you want in BBQ. The mac and cheese was good and had a nice hint of spice. The collard greens left us confused (why are they in a tomato sauce??). The mashed sweet potatoes were watery and way too sweet. The okra (also with tomatoes) was blah. The cornbread tasted good but was overcooked. The sweet tea was also too sweet. The portions are gigantic and on our visit the service was great. There was a band playing the night we were there and although I did not mind the music it was quite loud so we had to scream at one another in order to converse. The music would have been better appreciated at a different venue. We wanted to love you, but we left you still craving BBQ.

I was looking forward to checking this place out since it is close to home. The decor and overall layout is cute and very "ride 'em cowboy". The food was mediocre at best. I had the Pulled Pork Platter and the meat was pretty dry. This place has about four different sauces at the table so I drenched my pork with that. My plate came with two sides, which I chose baked beans (not your typical baked beans and I do not mean this in a good way) and mashed sweet potatoes (pretty good). The plate also came with a piece of corn bread with a look, texture, and taste I had never experienced before. Once again, I'm not sure if this was a good thing. Service was pretty good. Oh, and I also tried the stewed tomatoes (SO GOOD) and the collard greens (also great). I think I'd go back for drinks and maybe to have just some side orders.

Great Barbecue. Sauces are excellent. Favorites: Pulled Pork and Baby Back Ribs. Only thing I didn't like was the Mac n' Cheese. I keep coming back. Update: the Mac n' Cheese has improved and is pretty good now. I brought some friends from Texas here, and they thought it was as good as what they can get there. Staff is really friendly and attentive. If you're up for a good time, they'll make sure you have one. Note that there's another one of these in Venice, CA.

The best I've found in the city thus far. Sadly, it's far from my house, but every bit worth the trek. The chicken was fantastic (and i don't say that often about chicken), the baby back ribs, the brisket, the pulled pork.... all great. Sides were the best sides I've had at a bbq joint, beating out my second favorite, roadside bbq on Geary. I'll write more on Baby Blues later, but don't let that stop you from going now!

Horrible! ?I initially went to Baby Blues BBQ several years ago, shortly after they first opened and it was fantastic. ?I've been there on 4 occasions and it has de-evolved from 4 stars to one. My last visit was on July 4th and I ordered the baby back ribs, sides of mac 'n' cheese, and baked beans. ?It was all bad. ?Even the cornbread. ?The ribs were poor quality meat and overcooked. ?The sides did not taste fresh. ?Definitely, not at good as they have been in the past. Baby Blues BBQ is a franchise. ?I appears the initially had a pit boss who really knew what he was doing. ?After the place was up to speed, I assume this person(s) left...and it's gone downhill ever since. Could they at least serve good quality meat? ?Is it too much to ask? ?It doesn't matter...I will not be going back.

I really wanted to like this place - it's in my hood and I'm a BBQ fan, but not hardcore like some of the previous reviewers. ?I could give a hoot if it's pit-smoked or commercial smoked . . . if it tastes good, I'm in! They really need to work on the food though. ?And the ambience. ?The place feels thrown-together, half-finished, bad feng shui all over the place, bad lighting . . . it really affects the experience. We avoided the ribs due to the very mixed reviews of them here - got the pulled pork which was TASTELESS, didn't taste like smoke, or BBQ sauce, or anything - they basically didn't season it at all. ?However, the beef brisket was quite good, and somewhat redeemed the blah pork experience. ?The sides were generally good - great mashed sweet potatoes, great collards, and decent corn and okra. ?Decent cornbread, a little too dense for our tastes. ?Oh the other thing - of everything that was served, only the sweet potatoes were hot. ?Everything else was lukewarm, like it had been sitting around a while. Service was OK - a little confused, like it was their first or second night in business. ?Shouldn't they have it together by now?

I grew up in Oklahoma. My family was friends with some of the best BBQ restaurateurs in OKC and Texas. This place was amazing. I haven't ever had a BBQ place bring so many memories of home. I had tears of complete content in my eyes. #1. The sweet tea.....just like grandma's. #2. The mac n cheese....simple perfection. #3. The pulled pork....juicy and tender, melted in my mouth. #4. The pork ribs....my grandma would be proud of how clean the bones were when I finished. #5. Creamed spinach....wowzers #6. Corn bread....only grandpa made better. #7. Key lime pie....the sweetness with a nice finish of tart...(Can I have another please.) These guys know how to do it. I'll be back tomorrow. The decor is funky cute. Mis-matched chairs and table. Funky local art on the walls. Loud music in the background. Did they take a BBQ place from home and just drop it here? Love, love, loved it. My friend said it perfectly. "I don't remember the last time I was this happy." My sentiment exactly. I don't remember I had a meal this awesome in a looooooooong time.

We've been here twice, the first time was shortly after they opened. ? Both times the ribs were dry and overcooked. ?They tasted good, but they were extremely dry, the point of being inedible. ?But, I am getting ahead of myself. My boyfriend and I took my mom here (who has been eager to try this place since we came awhile back) for her birthday. ?We arrived just before 5 pm this past Sunday. ?We walked in, and the bartender looked at us and decided to help the people that came in AFTER us, who apparently came in to get take-out. ?There's no sign that says "wait to be seated", so we weren't sure if we should just try to find our own seats. ?There were a total of 6 people seated at tables eating/ordering, and about 4 people at the bar. ?It appeared that there was only one waitress for the whole place. The bartender finally looks up and asks us how many? ?3. ?Then he basically tells us to sit wherever. ?Thanks, we couldn't have figured that out a couple minutes ago. ?We sit down, and a waitress brings us the menus. ?The bartender comes to take our orders. ?I had the Memphis style ribs, with baked beans and mashed potatoes, the boyfriend ordered the brisket with mashed potatoes, blues corn on the cob, and added a hot link, and mom had the baby back ribs with coleslaw. ?Mom and I had tea and boyfriend had a beer. Food was delivered in a timely fashion, but the waitress neglected to refill our glasses, and didn't leave us with the barbecue sauce for the ribs. ?Mom's ribs and cole slaw were great, she loved them. ?Boyfriends brisket was delish, and the hot link was NOT hot. ?They did give him 2 hot links for $3.50, even though the order said 1. ?My ribs were DRY DRY DRY! ?The mashed potatoes were okay, but they have parmsean cheese, and I swear to GOD, it's the kind out of the green Kraft can! ?The corn had it sprinkled on top too! ?Bleck. ?The cornbread is the weirdest combination of greasy and dry. ?Horrible. ?I remember it was like that the last time we went. ?My baked beans tasted just like chili. ?They were disgusting. ? At some point in the middle of our meal, our waitress left and a new one took over. ?One table of 2 people got up and left, and another table of 6 arrived. ?We were never told "goodbye, and here's my replacement" by the original waitress, no one came to check and see how everything was, no one offered refills or more drinks. ?We were clearly finished eating when the new waitress took my boyfriends beer glass away, but she never offered to clear our plates, or ask if we wanted to take anything home. ?It took about 20 minutes to get our bill, and that was from the bartender, and they STILL never cleaned our table. ?I was livid, I have never received such horrible service, certainly not in a restaurant that was as slow as it was then! Oh, and the grand total for our "authentic" BBQ? ?$76.00, PLUS TIP. ?We only left $10, and in my opinion, that was too much. ?It should have been more like $5. ?Well, we can cross another "authentic" BBQ place off the list.

Somehow I was able to find the tear in the space-time continuum through which you must pass in order to go here when they were open. Hopefully they will be able to adjust the flux capacitor so that one may have barbeque here without coming back to find that everyone else has aged 10 years without you. Everything was very good, and I don't even think that the double decker quantum smoker was working yet while we were there. The one negative was the Beer Selection, I can't remember what they had, I just remember that they had nothing I wanted. I went back a few months later, and had a totally different experience, this time, I really didn't like anything, perhaps it is because I refined my barbeque pallate at Gorrila, or maybe the food actually changed, but I will not be going back.

Brisket is pulled= not my thing and tastes like pulled pork. Pulled pork = great bread, ok slaw, pairing of slaw and pulles pork is a little off esp. W/o vinegar based sauce to coat the NC style pullled pork in. Texas beef rib = best thibg we had, sioft, juicy, amazing. Memphis ribs = ok, nothing to write home about Baby back ribs = dry, unamazing, xhili's was better. So sad. Mac n cheese = amazing Collard greens = not my fav style but it works. Potato salad = basiclly a chunky deli style, refreshing, Cornbread = nothing special, dry Sweey tea = artificial sweetener, or just and odd brew. Decor= i like the archetecture inspired art Crowd and space= comfortable Service= not attentive but good Conclusion: worth it. Just remember it's san francisco service and you are eating bbq in california.

Yummmmmm... I wasn't even in the mood for BBQ, but we decided to try it since we'd walked by a few times saying, "One day." Had the Memphis ribs with the beef brisket (lunch platter) with the collard greens. ?I am not a meat eater much these days, but this reminded me of how delightful red meat can be. ?My food was perfectly seasoned, cooked and served. ?My husband had a sandwich (beer-marinated links of some kind) which he devoured in bliss. ?But I was way into the sauteed okra he had as a side. ?OH MY WORD! SO good! Plus, and this is a big plus to me, they have the most refreshing. not-too-sweet homemade lemonade I've had in any restaurant. ?Plus a great beer menu (pregnant, so couldn't partake!) I'm tempted to go right now just for the lemonade and sides I haven't tried yet (by the way, I did overhear a nearby diner refer to her mashed potatoes as "heavenly.") ?Well, maybe a little more brisket...

Wow, if I were giving a review just of their customer service, I would totally give these folks 5 stars. Six if I could. I came in here for takeout today, and even though the place was empty, someone was waiting right by the door and greeted me the minute I came in. He took my order lickety-split, and was sooo on top of things. I was in and out of there in no more than 10-15 minutes. It was amazing. It was also some of the best takeout packaging I've ever gotten--a nice paper bag with handles (like a gift bag), a generous supply of napkins and wet-naps, plastic utensils, the works. The food was in leakproof packaging. And even though they do have fountain drinks there, they gave me cans of soda in my bag--so much easier to carry away! We got a beef brisket sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, and sides of mashed sweet potatoes and mac and cheese. The sandwiches were hot and came with a yummy slaw on top of the meat. The meat was perfectly cooked, though I thought it could have used a bit more seasoning. The buns were toasty. There was one thing that I both loved and hated. The sandwiches came completely devoid of BBQ sauce, which was good in the sense that they weren't all soaked and soggy when we went to eat them. On the other hand, we were given 4 smallish containers of BBQ sauce, 2 of them very spicy and two of them mild. Even if we had each used both (and I couldn't use more than a little of the spicy one, 'cause I'm a wimp) there really wouldn't have been enough sauce for my taste. I think I probably could have gotten more sauce from them, or switched out the spicy for more mild, buuuut since it was my first time ordering from them, I didn't know. I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes, but my husband said his were great. Meanwhile my mac and cheese was ASTOUNDINGLY good--lots of gorgonzola in the mix. And the portions of the sides were more than generous. I actually ended up mostly sticking to my mac and cheese, saving my sandwich for when I could go home and use our big bottle of BBQ sauce on it, and I was still totally stuffed before I was even done with it.

I ate here with two buddies this past Sunday. As you can tell from my nickname, I LOVE ribs. I love them more than I love many people in my life, sad but true. Anyways, we had the Memphis Ribs and the Baby backs, some pulled pork and some links. Ribs and links were really good, I didn't care much for the pulled pork.For sides we had the creamed spinach, mac & cheese & cole slaw. Creamed spinach was good, a bit watery though, the cole slaw needed a bit more...marinating, is that the right word? Too crunchy. The mac & cheese was the bomb. Nice roomy restaurant, we sat at the "high table" at the front and we had plenty of table space. I notice there are a few bad reviews about the service here. For those who don't know, the SF Chron and http://SFgate.com ran a piece about new BBQ places in the Bay Area and Baby Blues was the main one featured. As a result they got inundated with customers...and they are new, a month old, so they are still getting their groove on. We waited about 35 min for our orders but I'm willing to go back again. This neighborhood can be a bit rough so watch your six.

I'm on a constant lookout for pulled pork and theirs is the best I've had in SF...complimented perfectly by the different types of hot sauce (infused with yellow bell peppers!?!) and coleslaw on the side. My BF got a sausage sandwich, mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The ambiance in Baby Blues is warm and welcoming, and we sat there for over an hour drinking beers and wallowing in deliciousness. Our server (John I think) was friendly and helpful...and a BBQ aficionado, of course.

Baby Blues is starting to hit its stride...the BBQ is getting much more consistent (although I still get stuff coming out over-charred on occasion). The BBQ hot wings were a great addition, and brunch this weekend was good and priced right. Paul, the owner is a great guy and really strives to make his customers happy...I find myself here a lot these days for a quick bite. Don't come here thinking you are going to get some smokey bad ass Texas Pit BBQ or something...leave your BBQ religion at home...

So the day I walked in there, no one was there - it was warm. ?I thought maybe they were prepping so I asked, "hi, are you open?" ? Now I realized that it's passe to call anyone a hipster these days - so I'll just say that the 'folks in ironic clothing" behind the bar snapped, "um...yes?" ?and sighed dramatically. I ordered the pulled pork plate with two sides - mac & cheese and collard greens and a coke. It is not okay to charge $2.00 for a can of coke. One star for the food coming quickly. The pulled pork was good enough. ?As good as any that I've found in SF. ?And there were four sauces that were divergent enough. One star for okay pulled pork. I think I had taken two bites before some guy came over and stood just behind my shoulder. ?He didn't say anything, he just stared. I finally turned to ask him if there was something I could help him with because I couldn't tell if he was about to swipe my bag or try to sell me a pair of old lens-less glasses. "Is everything okay," he asked? ?Oh...he works here. The mac & cheese had cayenne pepper in it. ?All the sauces had a similar cayenne peppery taste in them. ?And my greens...well, I'm southern y'all - my greens need to be cooked in fatback with some salt, pepper and a little vinegar. ?These greens were in...cayenne...tomato sauce??? ? When I say they were 'in', I mean smothered. ?The sauce would have been fine as a side or even with a bit of it splashed on, but these leaves were soaking, marinating, drowning in it. The guy with the poorly fitting pants came back over to ask me how my food was. Maybe this was to cover up the fact that they hadn't been washed very well so there was still some crunchy grit...or maybe the grit was supposed to be their authenticity. The guy who didn't look like he worked there came over again and asked me how my food was. The corn bread was tasty. ?Weird, but tasty. One star for weird, tasty corn bread. Except that I found a hair in my food. ? Minus one star for the hair in my food. Despite the fact that no one...and when I say no one was there, I mean that I was the only patron - and despite that some guy who might or might not have worked there had visited me five times (no exagerating) ?I somehow had to wait for the bill for about ten minutes. I think the sad part is that, I could have gotten a better meal in the south for less than half the price. Back to Memphis Minnie's for me.

I live right near baby blues BBQ and have been here several times as its close by and I love bbq. ?Tonight, however was the worst of several mediocre occasions. ?I keep trying to give Baby Blues another chance, but each time, am disappointed. ?The food is good. Very good, however the service leaves so much to be desired that the overall experience makes it not worth it. ?Tonight, my boyfriend and I had to each go up in alternating turns to get every aspect of service needed. ?First, they didn't refill our water. Then my boyfriend had to go up to request a beer even though they dropped the beer menu 15 minutes earlier. Then we had to ask for silverware. ?I asked for a drink menu and never got one. Had to go up for one myself. ?Then I had to go up and order a drink, of which never came. ?It was one waitress and one dark haired guy who seemed to just stand there. Finally we were done with the meal and spent another 15 minutes staring him down for the check. ?Finally, I went up and physically asked him for it, after which he said "sure" ?and never sent it to us. ?We were literally about to go up again when the blonde finally came over with it. ?I have never had such appalling service. The food is so tasty but the service makes me never want to return.

I'm not completely sold from my two visits, but I think if I realign my vision and desires, I could really love this place. The thing is, they boast Po'boys on the menu. I don't think they got 'em, as I've tried them, and I've been a bit disappointed. Actually they're nothing like po'boys in my opinion; I'm from New Orleans. But this is a BBQ place, as their name suggests and I've heard the pulled pork is pretty darn good. Maybe I need to quit pretending that this place is going to bring me home for an hour or two and just go for beers and sides. The sweet tea was too sweet for me. I wish they had more fried things on the menu... like fries. I've gotten the stewed tomatoes both times I've gone -those have been pretty good and still good 2 days later. I like the atmosphere though, and it might be a good place to grab a brew after work sometime.. I like their soundtrack and space...

Bad food makes me angry, and Baby Blues BBQ made me want to fling my plate against the wall and scream "Noooo!! Yuckies!!!" like a two-year-old. We ordered delivery on Friday night. Granted, I know that delivery food is often sub-par to the dine-in counterpart, so I tried to keep that in mind. The restaurant said that our food would arrive in about 30 minutes. By the time it actually arrived almost 2 hours later, I was a starving, raving food beast. I would have eaten anything you put in front of me. And yet, I couldn't choke down our food. The blackened catfish was inedible - overspiced and so dry that it was chewy. Beef brisket was stringy and flavorless. Even the famed mac and cheese was gross. I only had two or three noodles - the rest was bread crumbs, soaked in a watery cheese sauce. The only saving grace was the side of okra. And when okra is your saving grace, you know you're eating a shitty meal. So. Angry. Never again, Baby Blues.

I LOVED this place, Fcuk the "hipster" crap the FOOD WAS GREAT. the Ribs were perfect the Shrimp I wanted more the Brisket was like butta the Chicken a little on the dry side. the sides were good ..warm but not hot when served at the table. Taking a piss in the men's room was the best part knowing that I could be watched from the street level window that looked right down into the men's room , . but it was CLEAN & well kept for a male hormone raging restaurant. My date & me ordered the most expensive meal & we LOVED it., & both cannot wait to go back there. The whims on Yelp that have given this place 1 o2 stars are obvious losers, as the only tried a "sandwich" ???? give me a BREAK . SUPPORT this GOOD LOCAL place & save your plane ticket to KY...& buy yourself some KY JELLY instead.

Baby Blue's Ribs are definitely something you want to eat. Unless you're a vegetarian. ?Mack and cheese is a side you want to have on the plate. ?The collard greens were good. ?They make their own BBQ sauces, three to choose from, and all are unique. The fish was pretty good. ?If you don't like char from the grill you might not like this so much. Now I could make another song about BB BBQ, but I am too hungry now to even bother. ======================================= Baby Blues, you got what I need but you say they're just a friend And you say they're just a friend, oh Baby Blues You, you got what I need but you say they're just a friend But you say they're just a friend, oh Baby Blues You, you got what I need but you say they're just a friend But you say they're just a friend Dam Baby Blues you are whoring yourself out because you have so many people visiting. ?Dam your BBQ is good. ?And your XXX sauce.... BOOYAH! ?The pulled pork was tender and flavorful, red beans and rice, delicious, mac & cheese a bit on the runny side, and the corn bread was out of this world. ?Service was friendly and prompt. Baby Blues, you got what I need.

I have ?a love hate relationship with this place. First off, the service is shitty here. ?They take FOREVER to service you, even if HALF busy. ?Maybe it's just me. ?Maybe the mexican doesn't get served as quickly. ?Who knows!!!??? ?LOL... hahaha just kidding. But seriously, I live the Burger here! ?I simply adore the BBQ sauce also. ?However, I do have to say, that from the other reviews, I agree, if you have had SOUTHERN FOOD in a SOUTHERN STATE, you will be UTTERLY disappointed. ?BBQ should not take 45 minutes to arrive at your table. ?It should be there in 10, tops. ?I've had delictable Mama's Daughters Diner southern food in good ol Texas and I'll tell you this place is good, but it's no Southern Belle. The sweet tea is HORRIBLE!!! ?Not at all southern. ?But the burger is good. ?The Mac and Cheese is VERY lumpy and not creamy but watery... do better guys...it's not HARD to make Mac and Cheese creamy. The highlights. the burger, and the bbq sauce. ?Other than that... save up to take a trip to the south.

My friend and I shared the pulled pork, brisket, and rib sampler with the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes as sides. The mac&cheese was great! Some of the best I have had in so long! Their sauces were pretty good, and it was fun sampling them all. The service was awesome and the server was relaxed and personable to each of his tables although it was an incredibly busy dinner hour. However, the meat was not that spectacular. I guess I shouldn't be picky about bay area BBQ, but I felt like it could have been better. I felt that the meat in the pork and ribs was little over-cooked, and thus, lacked any meat taste. The brisket, however, did taste pretty good, although the texture was not as juicy as I prefer. I think it was probably attributed to the fact it was dinner hour and they were really busy. ?Although advised to order medium, our fellow diner ordered his burger rare, and it turned out to be mushy and tasteless. If I do return to Baby Blues, I'm definitely getting a medium-cooked burger with mac&cheese! and bottomless kool-aid, may I say more?

Easy people, it's a new place and they are having some hurdles getting open full time. Just give them a call on the old fashioned telly-fone and you will get more details as well as what sounds like a sincere apology for their delays.

Being inhabitants of Bernal Heights, we were very excited to see this place open. Our first experience was actually quite satisfactory, considering we had takeout and didn't have to deal with what we would soon learn to be a disorganized wait staff, a lack of available items on the menu, as well as favoritism from the servers to certain customers. On our second time eating at Baby Blues, the couple in line behind us (a middle aged, seemingly well to do couple) was seated at a nice booth, while we were made to sit at an uncomfortable dark corner of the dining area, on foldable chairs and eating off a foldable table. While the food isn't terrible, it is far from above average. The sides actually outshine the meat selections. The ribs are burnt, the chicken rather dry with too much sauce, but the grilled tiger shrimp is screaming good. It must be said that the mac and cheese is absolutely to die for, it is the perfect balance of cheese and bread crumb crispness. The main reason for the low stars, is after dinner a couple nights ago, the gf become really sick. REALLY sick. So maybe we'll try again in a few months, but until then I doubt we will be returning. Hopefully by then they will have it together a little more.

Ok, so was totally looking forward to checking this place out for days but the long awaited experience was not that great.....too much blue cheese in the mac-and-cheese, not enough butter in the mashed potatoes and of course not enough spice in the okra. ?The food is served by ninety pound hipster female servers that barely look strong enough to hold a plate of ribs, leave alone eat one! ?Baby Back Blues is for people that don't really know or appreciate authentic southern style barbecue or hospitality.

A good BBQ place needs time to break in, like a new pair of shoes. ?Baby Blues BBQ is shiny and new on the one hand, full of excitement and anticipation when you enter, but on the other, it has kinks that need to be worked out still. There's a big common table, a counter, and a bunch of tables. Great for families and larger groups (if you don't mind the wait). The decor was a bit spartan, with a few art pieces over freshly painted walls. The staff was top-notch (very friendly, helpful, and working as fast as they can), though with the big crowd, it was noticeable that they haven't gotten into a rhythm yet. That being said, they are off to an impressive start, and I expect as things settle in, the place will only get better. I had the baby back ribs, beef brisket, and blackened catfish. Sides included okra and mac and cheese. The highlight was the ribs. If you go, just get the ribs. The catfish didn't taste that fresh, and was a bit over-blackened, but again the ribs were great (did I mention the ribs?). The sides, were decent as well. Okra was cooked the right way (non-slimy), a bit on the over-salted-side, but the roasted tomato helped offset that. The mac and cheese wasn't that goopy stuff that some other restaurants have, but it was nicely baked. For dessert, we had the banana pudding. Now, that doesn't sound like the most fascinating of desserts, but it was damn good. Corn bread was superb as well. Good beer and wine selection, as well as beverages such as sweet tea. If you enjoy spicy foods, ask for the XXX BBQ sauce (if it isn't at your table already). It's the bomb. If I were to judge purely on food, decor, and price, I'd give 3 stars, but given that the ribs were great, that they put their heart into things, and that they've just opened, I think they deserve a solid 4 stars. I look forward to coming back, and trying out their other offerings. They certainly have the right idea, and with persistence, I'm hoping that I've witnessed the beginnings of a new San Francisco institution.

Usually, eating "soul food" in San Francisco is like learning culture by riding It's A Small World-- it's got the right idea, but never the right execution. I was pleasantly surprised by Baby Blues. Maybe it was because my expectations were so low, but the food had genuine flavor, good seasoning and a fairly large menu. Mind you, I only had one dish (the catfish plate), but I did enjoy it immensely. They could work on the Peach Cobbler. It was soggy, and too sweet. But other than that, I would go back again.... I'd just order the takeout, though. The bleached blonde waitresses offering me koolaid was really creepy.

I was a little dissapointed about this place, I decided to try it after reading about it on Chronicle. For one, it is pricey for BBQ place, even more expensive than Everret and Jones, but the food is just okay. We went as a big group on a busy Friday night, waited about 30 mins for a table. the hostess seem clueless, but the wait staff are quite on top of things, and the bartender were nice. They do have good beer on tap, I got a bluemoon as usual. Each entre comes with two sides, and they are range from $15 to 20, portion is big, especially if you get the 3 item plate. So 5 of us share 4 plates and it was enough. Their food are generally greasy, I know I know... what do you expect at a BBQ place, but it is more so than any other place I been to. Flavor, now that is problem, it is bland, I mean it is salty enough, but just doesn't have that finger licking spice flavor. Beef rib come in one giant piece, it does have considerable amount of meat on it, it is not bad. Pull pork is just okay, bland. Rib is okay, not bad, but you should just close your door if you can even make that right. Cat fish is small and bland. Now, comes to the sides, the corn bread is average, it is not as terrible as some might say here; collar greens, not cooked enough; mashed potato, good; roasted tomato; good, mac & cheese, average; smoke chicken rice, good. Bottom line, unless I am in the neighborhood and craving BBQ, I won't be back. Oh... parking is hard to find around here, so please take public transit.

I came here with my roommate on our fourth day in SF after moving here. ?We came here based on her friend's recommendation who said they had the best BBQ ribs. ?I'm not a fan of baby back ribs but I am a fan of trying new things so I thought, why not. Of course, when we got here, I didn't try the baby back ribs. ?Instead, I went for their pulled pork, even though I don't eat pork much. ?The pulled pork plate came with two sides and cornbread. ?For my sides, I ordered the Chicken Steamed Rice and Mac-n-Cheese. When my dish came, I dove into the mac. ?I thought I had found the best mac-n-cheese until I came here. ?Although that side is really heavy, it is also heavily delicious. ?It's really cheesy - I think there might be several different types of cheeses in it. ?The pulled pork was not bad but I couldn't get my fork out of my mac so I pretty much got full off of that. ?When I did decide to take a break and try the pulled pork, I first drenched it in their Tabasco Ginger sauce. ?Who ever thought of putting ginger in Tabasco? ?But hey! ?It works! ?The other sauce I really liked was the XXX BBQ sauce which was surprisingly spicy. ?But it's not hot. ?So for you hot chile eaters, this may be just medium or mild for you. ?I was really excited for their cornbread for some reason but when I bit into it, it turned out to not be that exciting. ?So I stuck to my mac. ?:) Service there was great. ?We got seated quickly, we got our food quickly, and our server was really friendly. ?He even was so nice to get me a slice of butter for my cornbread. The prices there are not awful but still kind of high. ?It was $14 for my plate. ?But I got leftovers so I can't complain. ?Much. ?So I gave them a 4 stars, rounded up from 3.5 stars. ?It's just that their Mac-n-Cheese is sooooo delicious.

Visited again Labor Day weekend '09 after repeated raves from my boyfriend. MUCH better! Is it just me, or is the place cooler now? The systems seemed better-refined, and the food was delish. I had the pulled pork. They had many wonderful sauces, and I found that I loved combining the vinegar-based one and the not-hot barbecue sauce. Though I loved that they had two other sauces to play with, also! The shrimp was great, too. Enjoyed the corn as well. Gash, what can I say? If they got a parking lot or a drive-through, I'd be a regular. Props to Paula our fabulous server, the guy working the bevs, and the cook. All provided excellent, prompt service.

I'll be the first to admit Baby Blues doesn't serve up strictly authentic bbq--it's definitely got a California twist to it--but it's damn good. I dined with another southern lady and we were both smitten. (but then we do both have a California twist to us). We split the bbq shrimp, which was great, crispy on the outside and still tender, but the sides really won me over. ?The okra was amazing, roasted and then stewed with tomatoes and bursting with okra flavor (but minimal okra sliminess). ?The creamed spinach, mashed sweet potatoes and blues on the cob were so good that all conversation at the table ceased until they were gone. ? The mac and cheese was good, but I wasn't blown away--it's baked and not gooey enough for me. ? I'd skip dessert next time; the pecan pie and the banana pudding just weren't that impressive. ?But there will definitely be a next time.

I used to come here when I was little...when it was a drug store! Needless to say I was taken back to my childhood coming here for some eats. My how times have changed...I'm not in a drug store anymore Toto... My favorite way to gage if I'll like a BBQ place is by trying a variety of items. I usually go with combo meals and sides. I got my order for takeout and the staff was pretty cool. I ended up trying the baby back ribs, pulled pork and brisket for sides: mac and cheese, collard greens, beans, and cornbread. For dessert key lime pie and banana pudding. The dessert selection was a bit lacking. They were out of two of the desserts I initially wanted to try (the pecan pie and the peach cobbler), so I ended up with my 3rd and 4th choices...the key lime pie, was alright, and the banana pudding was pretty good. People have been pretty into the cornbread, but I wasn't feeling it. I thought it was dry. The sauces were pretty good and I liked that they provided some peppers to accompany the meal. Overall, I found the place to be a little overpriced, but it was a good alternative if you are in that part of the city for some BBQ. The place was pretty cool inside, and they deliver if you are so inclined.

Been here twice now...its not terrible. ? It might be the best BBQ in the city...but since I've recently lived in Texas that really isn't saying much. Get the mac & cheese with whatever you order...it is excellent. ?I'm not a fan of the sauce that comes on everything but they've got several bottles on the table of various flavors so that you can fix what they bring out. ?Definitely order a platter and split it with someone. ?The meals are sized and priced for two. Soda comes in cans, that is a major flaw for a restaurant IMO and totally tacky. ?Waiters can be impossible to get ahold of...both times I've bene here I had to flag someone down to get the check. ?Would probably order delivery instead of going there next time. ?They've got some really uncomfortable bar stool tables that you can get stuck at..depending on how crowded the place is that night. Parking in this area blows...so the place really isn't worth battling that. ?I'm not sure why people rave about this place so much.

Baby Blues BBQ catered our annual company BBQ this year (150 attendees) and knocked it out of the park! Paul and his team were an absolute pleasure to deal with and the food was fresh and delicious. He did an on-site BBQ with chicken, brisket, pulled pork, portabella mushrooms, hot dogs, corn, garden salad, and coleslaw. He also arranged for all the rental equipment including tables, chairs, wine glasses, and linens. All for a super reasonable price. I would definitely recommend using Baby Blues BBQ for your next event!

Being a BBQ connoisseur and enjoying every type of environment from the upscale to the ghetto I think this place is mediocre at best. I've only eaten there once and am willing to think maybe they had a really off night but their beef brisket was absolutely terrible, honestly an embarrassment to be served. It tasted like a pressure cooked shredded chuck steak. The ribs were ok, definitely not fall off the bone and by no stretch of the imagination were they great. Sides were about the same, which was just ok. Prices are a little on the high side but the restaurant atmosphere was cool in that Mission funky kinda way.

There's not a lot of good BBQ in the city, so Baby Blue certainly scratches an itch. It's a fun place to grab a not-too-expensive meal, I really like the pulled pork sandwiches.The service has always been great and the place has a laid back, fun vibe. I don't like the way they do their sides and the key lime pie was not good - but it's a BBQ place and the focus is tender, delicious meat, so I am not going hard on them. I don't love it enough to head across town and find parking, but it's a great neighborhood choice for BBQ.

This place was pretty good. ?I actually like the cornbread better than the brisket, and that pretty much never happens b/c I love meat. ?

My first experience with Baby Blues was via delivery. ?I plan to visit the place soon and try the ribs. It was easy to order via telephone and delivery was quick, and the dude was really friendly. ?Prices were good, you get a hunk of meat and two sides for less than $15. ?I also love that they offer a platter that is composed of only sides. I had the pulled pork platter with collard greens and mac-n-cheese. ?YUM! ?The greens were just salty and acidic enough, I love to eat them with the mac-n-cheese because it cuts the creaminess just a bit. ? Mr. B had the brisket, which he said was fabulous. ?The blues corn does not travel well, but I'd like to give it another shot at the restaurant. ?The mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery and smooth. I was a little disappointed that the platters came sans advertised corn bread, which is why this place has to earn that last star. ?That being said, I'm sure it wouldn't have been forgotten if we dined inside. I'll be back. ?I'm so stoked to have a good BBQ joint that delivers!

Cliff Notes: Marginally Average BBQ...Good Mac and Cheese I want to start of by telling you this place doesn't really have any substantial signage, unless you count the "DRUGS DRUG STORE" and "BBQ" signage. Anyway onto the food. The ribs tasted okay, but didn't taste smokey enough, they weren't juicy just not dry. Pulled pork, I know its pulled pork, but I hate dry pulled pork.I know smothering it with BBQ sauce is natural, but I want to be able to eat it without the sauce sometimes. Hotlink - aint nothing special, an Evergood hotlink is probably better. Creamed Spinach - great, not the pureed kind you might be expecting, but good. Okra- Sauteed not fried, decent. Mac and Cheese. I think I could come here for just that, best mac and cheese i've ever had. Cornbread - one of the better pieces of cornbread I've had. Onto the Service Waitress was friendly, but I found it kind of odd that she had no idea she was out of lemonade, and that the beef brisket wasn't ready yet. Service....was okaaaay I guess.

After driving by this place on the way home from Goood Frickin Chicken about 20 times, we finally remembered we wanted to try it BEFORE having eaten. Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of BBQ, but there are always a few things on a menu I like. So we ordered the one appetizer (Suicide Kings) and the Mason Dixon plate (1/2 rack Memphis Ribs; BBQ chicken breast, 2 sides, cornbread). I'm not sure if they really expect one person to eat that much food. The appetizer was strange. It was corn bread topped with pulled pork, something creamy and served with cole slaw. It tasted good when you ate the components separately, but together it was a mish-mash. It was also a lot of food. I would guess it was a 1200 calorie dish. It also arrived at the same time as the entree, defeating the purpose of ordering an appetizer. The entree however fell short. First, the choices for side dishes (Fixins) are all starches or fats with the exception of the collard greens and the stewed tomatoes. My man hates stewed tomatoes, so we ordered the collard greens and the mashed sweet potato. The collard greens were cooked in a stewed tomato sauce. (Sorry Muffin.) I thought the mashed sweet potatoes tasted like baby food, my boyfriend thought they tasted more like lamb food. The biggest problem however was the meat. I'm a chicken breast connoisseur, and my chicken breast was completely dried out. Boston Market cooks moister, more flavorful chicken. Portion-wise, it was a ginormous chicken breast, but I had to soak it in sauce to give it any flavor. My boyfriends ribs were also problematic. First, Baby Blues has itsy-bitsy tables that are covered in condiments before you sit down, then the food is served on plastic plates, and their utensils are dollar-store quality. As he tried to cut his ribs apart, the plate kept sliding around on the table until I finally held it in place and then his fork bent backward from the pressure of his index finger. Fortunately it was easy to bend back. (Perfect for Uri Geller) They get points for what I assume are recycled chairs, but lose points for the sharp edges underneath that scratched up our fingers. On the other hand, the service was friendly and attentive without interrupting our conversation. We really wanted to like this place, but it fell short in too many ways.

Been wanting to try this place for a while, finally had the chance for lunch yesterday. ?Grabbed a lunch special consisting of pulled pork, a hot link, brisket, and one side for around $12. ?Not bad, comparable to every other BBQ joint in the city. ?Service was excellent, and the waitress even took the time to explain the different sauces and give her opinion of what complements each meat the best. Food was fantastic, the pulled pork was great- especially with the apple cider vinegar. ?Brisket was cooked just right, and was extremely moist. ?Hot link wasn't anything to write home about, but was still quite tasty. ?My dining partner had the baby back ribs, and said they were fantastic. ?She also had the okra for a side and that was absolutely delicious. ?Had the collard greens myself, and they were pretty good, but her okra really stole the show. All in all, would definitely go back and would recommend to anyone seeking quality BBQ. BTW, I would chalk up most of the bad reviews here to a new restaurant getting into the swing of things. edit: Forgot to mention, was not impressed with the cornbread at all- but that's but a minor quibble. ?BB BBQ, how about some biscuits instead?

A pretty nice BBQ joint for the Mission... Finally. But they have a bit of work to do, especially with the ribs. While the ribs were huge, the meat was tough and dry. I need that flesh falling off the bone! I don't think I'll be ordering them again. The real highlight, surprisingly, is the coleslaw. Man, this IS the best coleslaw I have ever piled into my mouth. I'll come back just to eat this. Baby Blues, please work on the ribs! Until then I'll have to make the drive to Famous Daves BBQ in Gilroy, by far the best ribs I've had.

I was at my friend Tony's birthday shindig last ngiht when I realized I HADN'T EATEN ALL DAY. This was after a shot of Wild Turkey 101 and a glass of Stella Artois. I ran down to the Baby Blues BBQ I'd seen walking up, and asked if i could order to go at 10:30pm. They were awesome and said yes! Note: If you come expecting any kind of good BBQ outside of the south (outside of Georgia for me) then you are a bit daft. That being said, it was passable. I had a pulled pork sandwich, which is firmly from my part of the South. The vinegar sauce was really good - the best part of the sandwich. The cole-slaw was good as well - cut with a machine though. The meat - tasted like they'd just thrown a whole pork shoulder in the oven for 5 hours. Sure, it's OK to do that - but no spices? No rub? I know these people are wimps out here but PLEASE put something on the meat before cooking it. I will come back and try their other stuff. To their credit, they convinced me to drink another beer while waiting for my sammy. I'm going to give them the recipe for Brunswick Stew - they promised me to be the only restaurant in SF to carry it if I'd just give them a recipe.

Walking in here, we weren't greeted but walked straight to a table and seated ourselves. From that I was thinking, "ugh,great another place that's rude". But right when we sat down, the owner (not sure about that) but he seemed to be, came and greeted us & handed us menu's. Okay so on to the food: Happy that they offer Lunch Specials Mon-Sun, but they didn't seem the best deal. We ordered: The Lakers Burger: this has bacon, blue cheese and dijon berry in it. My bf loooooved it and the owner said his brother makes the sauce to go with it. I had "The Hound dog": this was really good. I chose greens as my side (like always) i'm a huuuuge fan of greens, if the place serves greens, i'll try them. Plus I make some bomb-ass greens! they're good for you!! anyways, the greens were real good,not thee best i had. but the Cornbread was delicious!! you can taste small pieces of corn in it. The Beef Brisket was semi-good. I didn't finish it. Something about the sauce I didn't like. Everything had some type of spicyness to it. Cornbread had some jalapeno, beans had jalapenos and the greens were spicy. But it was that perfect spicyness, not overwhelming at all. The service was great. The place wasn't empty but wasn't busy. The cooks were real nice and attentive. Also, they gave great tips on how to eat the food and with what sauces. Plus, the food was very fresh. I would come here again. I seen they had Smoked CHicken wings, so I gotta try those. Thanks BB BBQ!

i have walked by this place a lot, looked in the window, looked at the menu, keep thinking i would try it...WHAT WAS I WAITING FOR?? i went there today...it was so good.. the sauces were all excellent and interesting. i ordered a chicken sandwich with one side ...it was a lot of food. the chicken was thick and tasty and grilled perfectly. The sandwich reminded me of the ones in the South using that kind of a roll, then topped with cole slaw, pickle on side of plate. my fixin; was sauteed OKRA...it was soooo good... Iwas stuffed and could not eat any more, although I would have liked to i will not be walking by there much any more. I WILL BE WALKING IN THERE.. good service, etc...

Excellent and authentic BBQ. My bf and I were hoping this was not another fancy version of southern bbq that was overpriced and not that good. We were happy to report that it was legit. I had brisket and he had the pork ribs which were amazing and falling off the bone. I love sides and they did not disappoint. Loved the collard greens, mac and cheese (awesome large noodles and creamy sauce), baked beans, and coleslaw (although I like mine a little more vinegary). Staff was really nice. Would recommend going during the week as weekends are crazy also they have nice long tables if you have a big group. Although pretty sure you can not reserve if you get their early you should be ok. ?Will def be back as it is next to one of my fav bars The Knockout.

can I tell you how freakin hard it is to try and get actual good food, with laid back service? There is a fine line between a$$-kissing and being geniune, and I get the sincere feel that the people here aren't the superior-that-thou hipsters. Plus, the food... wow it is actually good. I wasn't insulted by the posturing of most BBq's where they par-boil the hell out if it, then throw it into a smoker, and then expect you to be grateful to get a plate of medorcre meat. so go... enjoy yourself... and keep your expectations REALISTIC!!! ?don't go expecting no lines, don't go to have an orgasmic mouth experience... go, be chill, be happy...and eat meat

This place is awesome. ?Great southern BBQ, the real deal. ?I've been there 3 times in the last month, that's how good it is. The menu is extensive with a variety of meat choices and side dishes. ?The Memphis ribs were outstanding - smoky, meaty, just the right right amount of sweetness ?The Carolina is good too which is a bit sweeter and less smoky. ?Pull pork & brisket are also out of this world. Side dishes are good here too. ?Corn bread is rustic with pieces of corn embedded. ?I'm not too crazy about the way Collard Greens were prepared. ?It's a bit bitter and sour. ?I love Collard G, but I think this is a bit overcooked for my taste (could just be a southern thing). ?The beans were really tasty and so is the Fresh Banana Pudding, which is incredibly fresh and home made tasting. ?It's highly recommended, so save room for dessert. The place is pretty basic so don't expect anything fancy. ?It's a great place to bring kids as it's very casual. ?The building is interesting as it's in an old drug store. ?Parking is fairly easy on the street (meter parking). Lunch is a couple of bucks cheaper, but you only get one side. ?Sandwiches are also available if you're not a big eater, which is a good way to try out their meat before committing to a large, more expensive entree. Service is really friendly. ?I think it's probably family-run as they really seem to care about their customer. ?They're patient, helpful and cheerful. ?They're the friendliest bunch of servers I've seen in a long time. This is my favorite BBQ in the city, so I will be heading back there soon.

Went back with James G. Mike G. and Mike M. Only two of the tables in the restaurant were occupied so the service was sooo much better this time. Still super friendly, but much much quicker this time. I also went with ribs and pulled pork instead of the brisket (since it's pulled and still covered in sauce as I stated in my previous review). Had a Trumer which came in sweet, tall Trumer glasses. The ribs were pretty awesome and the pulled pork was exactly what I had expected. Cole slaw was a great option, and Mike G's Mac and Cheese was great this time. Seriously, last time it was a watery mess. They've picked up the pieces since my last visit and I would def. recommend people to head there and give it a shot. (Still prefer Memphis Minnie's, but this is a solid choice if you're in the neighborhood - don't think I'd drive too far to visit it though).

Until I have tried every dish, the last star has to wait. ? I've been here twice in the past week and each experience was good. The busy Sat night experience was a good gauge of service. It was prompt and friendly. The first night I had the Pulled Pork and it was delicious. The others had the ribs and the "Three Kings". By nights end we were stuffed and enjoyed a good meal. Tonight I had the Memphis Chicken and my wife had the BBQ Pork Ribs. The rub on the chicken was excellent, the white meat was moist and quite tasty. After I noticed part of the dark meat on the half chicken I got was a bit red, one of the owners came by to share how the rub on the chicken was his idea and how it has been challenging to cook the chicken just right without making it dry. They then took my chicken back and replaced it with a plate of beef BBQ ribs with shrimp on the side. It was an awesome gesture. The ribs were great and the additional sides were a great sampler. My favorite sides are the Okra and the Collard Greens. For the first time I actually liked the coleslaw. The version they had was something I enjoyed eating. My memories of slaw were of the "too much mayo" variety. We also tried the stewed tomatoes (wife's favorite), mac n' cheese, mashed potatoes, and the baked beans. The cornbread was good as well.

Holy piles of meat, Batman! ?Give me a bottle of that ginger tobasco to drink, will you??? I am fond of all types of BBQ, but being that I am from the northeast, I don't really know my ass from my elbow when it comes to the age old battle of the south and which city has the best slabs of slow-cooked meat. ?So when my born-and-raised-in-Kansas-City grillmaster friend disclosed that Baby Blues was the real thing, I was sold. The pulled pork, the ribs, the slaw, the okra, the corn bread-- all are seriously delicious business. ?The home-made sauces that sit tableside are also out of this world-- each just different enough to please whatever your palate wants: ?Spicy? ?Smokey? ?Sweet? ?They have a sauce for that. I have vowed that next time, I will save room for a peach betty, whatever that is.

Not a bad place. ?Menu is pretty vast although, they offer sides separately. ?Whatever. ?So I came here one time with my friend awhile ago to have dinner. ?And since Nate's didn't have Hot Links the time I was feenin' for it, I needed to have my link fix. ?Enter Baby Blues BBQ. So it's not really BBQ sauce they put on it...the link was not marinated, on a ciabatta bread roll & my friend had the rack (he wore a white shirt & we were both surprised after he annihilated the rack...his shirt was spotless). ?The sauces they provide you with are pretty good & different in their own way. It's pretty pricey, but there's usually always live entertainment, and you'll have to yell to say what you're saying to the person that's sitting right across from you. ?Don't come here on your Nate's BBQ budget.

My service was beyond excellent. ?Perhaps they're listening to their feedback in this regard. ?Food itself might be slow to cook -- what do you expect? I had a half-rack of baby-back ribs. ?They were more tender and less dry than Memphis Minnies. ?The sauces aren't as varied as Minnie's. There's no equivalent for that yummy mustard BBQ sauce. ?I also prefer Minnie's collard greens, although they're a bit of an acquired taste. ?But the ribs are better at Baby Blues, and they at least have pulled pork on the menu. ?Yeehaw!

nnnnnnnnnDUDE! I was expecting some crap BBQ like you would find at safeway..pre cooked, burnt, not much flavor, but this place is the exact opposite of that. I got a meal that had brisket (ALOT OF BRISKET) hot link, 2 sides and a soda for like $14 bucks and for the quality and amount fo food, I was expecting to pay at least $20. The sides was quite big, as I got the mashed sweet potatoes and cornbread. I asked for the meal to go, and it came in a tinfoil package which perfectly held everything in it's own compartments...very lucky too since the brisket is very juicy! They also have an assortment of their own sauces which they put into to-go containers, as requested. I am honestly trying to find something I didn't like, but so far, I couldn't. I'm going back soon, so if the place suddenly starts to suck, I will update

This place ain't too bad, been here once on a weekend food run. ?Felt the urge to eat some bbq and this was the closest bby joint by my hood. ?Even though I've only been here once my food experience was a positive one. ?Obviously I'd have to go there more than once and check out the other items on the menu. ? But all in all if you are down by the Mission and Cesar chavez street area and you are feenin for Mexican food, Phat Philly that are close by that area then roll down here for some bbq.

Flash me those baby blues! Bad morning at work a few weeks back- time to walk down Precita for lunch somewhere where I will not be hassled and will also not be within shouting distance of my office. Baby Blues BBQ- had heard of this mythical place from some of the teachers at the school- and decided to treat myself. Definitely a treat- amazing sauteed okra and mac and cheese and I got wonderful BBQ chicken, thinking the whole time about how I needed to bring people back here. The best part was that the portions were huge for me and I got to save the leftovers for lunch the NEXT stressful work day! Very nice staff and I'll definitely go back - if only to try the ribs and the beer selection....and more okra and mac and cheese.

The best part of my meal was the cornbread - that says a lot! I ordered the Razorback Platter for takeaway, and I enjoyed it but definitely not the best bbq to be had in the city. The cornbread was nommy with its moist, almost carrot-cakey consistency. The baby back ribs were good and had a nice smoky crust on them. The pulled pork looked like a pile of grayish mush - not appetizing. The bbq sauce was just ok. The restaurant itself had a great vibe and the service was friendly!

After my 3rd visit to Baby Blues I'm ready to give props now where props is due. ?Cue is hands down my favorite food, and I'm always happy to have a new place in the city serving it up. ? My first visit was a bit shaky, but the last two have been great. ?I prefer the spare ribs to the baby backs. ?So juicy they didn't need sauce. ?The "ropa vieja" style of shredded brisket is great too. ? Sides are solid. ?Mac and cheese is great, collard greens tasty and smoked rice different and kinda cravable. ? Very nice people running the place. ?Minus a star for the mediocre live music playing the other that sang happy birthday no less than 5 times. ?(really......) ?Also, the prices are a tad steep for frequency.

I went there twice. ?the first time, the texas ribs were something out of a cave man feast -- a giant piece of beef with some rib bones that was charcoal black on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside, and so big that I couldn't finish it and had to take it home. ?I went there a second time and the texas ribs were evenly cooked through and kind of boring, nothing like the first time. ?If I could consistently get those cave man ribs, I'd go more often.

I would give this place 3 & 1/2 stars if I could. Definitely some good home cooking. My review is just a smidge biased because I like my ribs slathered with bbq sauce. I know that they have bbq sauces on the side, but I prefer tomato based bbq sauce versus vinegar based. I also came here for a baby shower and a party menu had already been ordered. Pros: -Baby Back Ribs were so tender and juicy. The meat fell off the bone just as it should. -Beef Brisket was so GOOD. -Interesting Mashed Potatoes, a good thing! -Cornbread. -Blue Moon on tap! =) Cons: -Bbq chicken was pretty bland. -Although the Beef Brisket was my favorite meat there, it was just a tad too salty. Hopefully it was just that batch =/ -I expected more from the Pulled Pork. -Parking was exceptionally hard to find. ? I will definitely be going back to try the other meat and side choices Baby Blues BBQ has to offer.

BBQ DELIVERED to your DOOR. There are maybe only a few things more conducive to being a happy, lazy fatty. Had the Memphis Queen (1/2 baby back ribs, 1/2 memphis ribs), both styles were smoky, flavorful, and moist. Also tried a 1/2 pound of the pulled pork (eh, weird flavor?), and 1/2 pound of the brisket (delicious, vinegary taste). The beans and cornbread were great too. The food is pretty darn good, you can pay by credit card on the phone....and you can eat it wearing sweat pants at home!

A late friday meal, so we just got a taste of this place (beef briskets and catfish). ?The service was attentive and friendly. ?I do appreciate a place that looks after your drink levels (definitely a plus). ?They were able to accommodate 6 peeps pretty easily, but by 9pm (closes at 10pm), the place was at the tail end of the night. ?That said, we're going back to try the messier things on the menu. ?And, while they cater and do huge bags of meat, I would recommend trying the sit down before ordering a hefty side of beef or pig. ?Although when you need that for a party, why not right? btw: nice flat screens for the sports peeps, a few regular on-taps. Also, great photo opt in front with neon signs shouting 'DRUGS BBQ"!!! More to come on this review later. Eat here!

So as many other birthed Southern folk, Texas, I had yet to find BBQ worthy in SF since I moved here in 2006. ?I stumbled across this place while waiting to meet someone at the bar El Rio, strategically seated across the street. I was eager to try their brisket or ribs as those are the main things to screw up if you're doing legitimate BBQ to go in my mouth. ?They were out, as they order so much fresh meat per day... ?so I had the BBQ Chicken Sandwich on what seemed like a freshly homemade toasted Kaiser-esque BUN with grilled onions & the best West Coast BBQ sauce that I've ever tasted to date --- the XXX Hot BBQ sauce is of the owner's, Scott, homemade recipes and is tastetastical!! The sauce is thick and made with 4 different peppers: Jabenero, Jalepeno, Pablano, and another unknown chili to make those super nice "on fire" lip tingles. I'm moving to N.Berkeley, but I'll be coming back to SF proper for this place for sure. ?I'm eager to find this places rival ----

Baby Blues BBQ was mediocre. We ordered Memphis and Baby Back Ribs. Both were charred to the extent that each bite tasted of char and not meat. Beneath the layers of char was some tender meat but getting at it meant losing a key component of the ribs - the skin and crust. We ordered Mac n Cheese, Creamed Spinach, and the Cornbread for our sides. All were okay but again, mediocre. On the other hand, the service was spectacular and my friend and I both remarked how genuinely (i.e. not forced) friendly, good-natured and outgoing our hostess was. We enjoyed our evening there and by the time we left the place was packed full of people waiting to find somewhere to sit.

What's a girl gotta do to get some decent BBQ in this city? Baby Blues was just ok. I got a lunch special called "The Razorback", which had 1/2 rack baby back ribs, a pile of pulled pork, cornbread and a choice of a side. The pulled pork was definitely the star of the show in that it was very tender and juicy, but it was bland (close, but no cigar). The ribs were tough, chewy and under seasoned. I'm very particular about my ribs. I like them to fall off the bone. These were far from that. They could also have used some more flavor. The coleslaw I got as my side could have used something... I can't quite put my finger on. Perhaps a little onion, or a dab of horseradish, just something to give it a little oomph. Did I mention the steep prices? So, all in all, Baby Blues missed the mark.

On an eternal quest for bbq in this city the bf and I headed here Monday night. We both got pulled pork plates, he had baked beans and potato salad, I had mac and cheese and collards. Everything was just okay to pretty good, beans and potato salad were pretty bland, I didn't care for the texture of the mac and cheese (it was almost like having a mac and cheese scramble) but I loved the greens, they were done perfectly with bits of bacon and stewed tomato. The meat was good but as someone else said the sauces weren't very barbecue-y. After we got our food we were completely ignored for the rest of the meal. ?I tried flagging anyone down to give us a bill at the end and finally resorted to walking up to the bar where I could see a guy sorting through checks. ?$5 beers make me pretty unhappy too. I guess I expect a little more for my $50.

We arrived with a group of 6 people. I always like a warm greeting at the door, and this place delivered. We decided to go for the "Teaser," which gave us ample opportunity to sample most items on the menu. My personal favorites: cornbread, mac and cheese (the best I've ever had, aside from what my girlfriend makes), brisket, and pulled pork. The best part? Each of the six of us left with a container for lunch the next day. Even better, despite gorging ourselves on smoked meat, none of us felt disgusting afterward. Yes, the neighborhood is sketchy. Yes, the parking is not so great. I really wish people would review a freaking restaurant, rather than writing an essay on every other thing that impacted their evening.

Got take-out tonight. ?Big Blue Platter w/ 3 meats & 2 fixin's - got double pulled pork, beef brisket, creamed spinach & mac 'n cheese. ?My husband and I grew up in the south (he in Little Rock and I in Austin), so we have high expectations for bbq meats. ?The pulled pork was nice and tender but lacking in flavor, definitely needed the sauce. The hot hot sauce was nearing too hot. ?The vinegar sauce was great on the pork and the other bbq sauce they gave us was pretty tasty. ? The beef brisket was interesting. ?Coming from Texas, I'm accustomed to sliced brisket, they had it pulled - strange. ?Flavor was alright but tasted like it hadn't been slow roasted for long enough, my man said "it needed more smoke." ? Regarding the sides...we didn't get our cornbread. ?I was upset to find this out at home, particularly since Yelp reviews spoke highly of it. ?The creamed spinach was horrible; tough, chewy, unseasoned, just not well prepared at all. ?The mac 'n cheese however was delicious. ? In conclusion...they have Shiner Bock on tap - good enough for me to go back.

The pulled pork was more chunked than pulled and had little smoke. Oddly enough it was the brisket that had been pulled and doused a heavy sauce and was delicious. The cornbread was visibly burnt and very dry. Splitting a 3 meat/2 sides plate was plenty for two people. The beer selection is decidedly odd with only Guinness and Anchor Steam to hold down the deep end and then a stack of Shiner Bock, PBR, Trumer Pils and the ilk flailing around in the shallows with narry a grease cutting IPA in the house.

House made hot sauces on every table. ?One with 4 chiles, one Ginger Tobasco (very unique), one mild vinegar 'standard'. i wanna go back!!! ?If I didn't live 60 miles away, and it wasn't closed right now, I'd be there!

This is a tricky review for me. I really really want to love this restaurant. The first time I went it was a busy night and the food was awesome.The ribs were delish the sides are amazing. The mac and cheese...SO good. Collard greens- Yum! I have been 3 times since and I have to say the dinner has never been as good as that first night. But I want it to be SO BADLY! I love BBQ, especially good BBQ. This is OK BBQ, but after meeting the owner I believe he will strive to be the best he can be. Working to never let a dry over cooked piece of meat leave the kitchen. I will keep trying, hoping for perfection.

Living just a few short blocks away we have been going to Baby Blues since just after they opened. ?Usually we go after we've exhausted our burrito/thai/vietnamese rations for the month, and it really is a comfortable place (excluding the too short benches) to hang out, and eat BBQ. ?The staff is always nice, the clientele varied, sometimes there's live honky tonk playing (is that how you spell honky tonk?). ?On average the food is always really good, though sometimes the tendency is to overcook some things (shrimp, chicken breast). ? Up until today I considered Baby Blues a pretty benign, non threat to my decency and pants size, because you had to make the choice to go there, and because I pass it pretty often while I'm jogging, and that puts it all in check because I'm able to feel at that very moment how hard it is to say good bye to juicy, tangy, fatty BBQ. ?But, today for lunch we had the pulled pork (boyfriends) and chicken (mine) sandwiches and collard greens, and they were DELIVERED TO US! ?That's right folks, BBQ delivery, which means that I'll either have to up the jogging (ya, right) or hide all phones in the toilet tank and force myself to eat vegetables and quinoa from our fridge....hard to do when a plate of ribs is just 20 min. (ya, they're fast too) away, and you can eat your messy, smeary, delicious, gluttonous meal in the privacy of your own home.

I didn't realize I arrived at Baby Blues BBQ until my friend walked in the door because of the "DRUGS" sign above the establishment. Looking around, I noticed a couple of divey bars and a flamboyant club across the street. Once I walked in, the 50s inspired decor seemed as funky as its exterior. Once seated, I ordered the beef brisket with mac n cheese and collard greens. My friend ordered the pulled pork with potato salad and baked beans. We were immediately served, not even 5 minutes passed before our plates were placed in front of us. It was a Monday so there weren't many others in the restaurant. I thoroughly enjoyed the baked beans, it was topped with a heap of pulled pork and full of flavor. Their BBQ sauce and beef brisket are quite satisfying, but I was incredibly disappointed with the collard greens and unimpressed by the mac n cheese and potato salad. The collard greens were cooked in some kind of salty tomato stew and was nothing like southern collard greens. Mac n cheese had a great texture but the flavor was lacking. Decent food, but it feels more like someone wanted to make a BBQ place their way instead of how it should really be.

Disclaimer: I'm from the South. This place is just ok. It's not great by any means. However, there are not that many places you can get good BBQ in San Francisco.. GOOD: The mac n cheese ---------------------------- BAD: Sides are often somewhat cold Food is a little too expensive for what you are getting The servers need to shower before coming to work ---------------------------- Lastly... What's up with not offering free refills on soda? I probably wont be back.....

I'm from Texas originally, and this BBQ joint gets five stars!! Their burgers are amazing, as well as the ribs and mac n cheese, and don't forget the banana pudding. They really do the ribs right, so I suggest you order the ribs when you go here. Also, they serve the best sweet BBQ sauce I've had in all of the west, and it comes right, ON THE SIDE, not slathering the meat, so you can dip the way you want. The Brisket isn't Texas style slices, but it's still pretty good on a sammich. I'm a self proclaimed Brisket badass, so I don't expect anyone to make Brisket better than I do. Even Memphis Minne's doesn't get it quite right..... A special thank you goes out to their delivery driver Julian for getting us here at http://Huddler.com all of our food on time and hot!! They DELIVER!!! Holy Moly, I don't think I'll need to go back to Texas for good BBQ! Thanks Baby Blues!

This place is located on Mission St. ?First ?impression --- scary spot , but once you go in you're greeted so nicely by the staff. The place was kid-friendly and it has a homey relaxed feel to it. ?And oh the food...AWESOME BBQ Ribs and Chicken!!!

Have ordered delivery a few times, always was decent never was wonderful. ?The service last time was a little disappointing. ?Ordered food, and not all of it came. ?called and they basically kept telling me I was wrong and it all did... Thought it did not. ? I felt bad asking for a new one as I don't live close and the delivery guy was on bike, but I had them send a new one over anyways. ?When the ?the delivery got there, he told me he was told to tell me that we did get it again (he was nice and when I explained he said - "oh, then their bad") but I really didn't appreciate being treated like either an idiot or somebody trying to scam food from them.

Ordered the Big Blue platter for delivery - choice of 3 meats and 2 sides with corn bread for $25. Asked for chicken, Memphis ribs and brisket; received chicken, Memphis ribs and pulled pork, even though the order taker's slackjawed phone manner caused me to clarify my order twice. All three meats were pretty dry, especially the unordered pork. And the other two could *technically* be described as falling off the bone, but not in a super-tender meat kinda way. More like a fossil bones unearthed near each other by chance type situation. Mashed potatoes and okra were pretty good, and the corn bread was tasty, though the texture reminded me more of pound cake. No choice of sauce, and whatever they gave us was nothing special, and not as good as whatever's in your fridge or anything from North Carolina (not their fault). Delivery was lightning quick! They quoted 45 - 60 minutes, food arrived in less than 20. Nice, but I really wish they had used some of the extra time to do a quality and customer service check on the order before letting near-petrified remains out the door. I'm never in THAT much of a hurry. I had a much better experience when I ate there last year, even though I don't really remember... since I had come from the Dovre Club nearby (not their fault). Meh.

Baby back ribs were great. Chicken smoked rice was tasty. Everything else we tried was meh to nope. The food was really overpriced. The service was WAY too slow. (this pissed me off) eating there ended up being a painfully long drawn out affair and the food was not worth the wait or the price tag. They are trying to charge the prices of "Blue Plate" but fall far short with respect to food flavor, serving sizes, decor, and service. Our server Paul (the owner?) and the ribs were the only thing that saved this place from a 1 star rating. I know they just opened but they need to hire some more staff and trim some of the BS from their prices. I'd recommend George's at 24th if you are after some good BBQ. Try Georges brisket it is the best.

The food here was delicious! The ribs fell off the bone and the pulled pork was one of the best I have tried - juicy and flavorful. The bbq sauce sweet if you like that and the be careful of the hot sauce because it is hot hot hot! The venue itself is nice and bright, and when we went they had a blue grass band playing. The only drawback is place is very busy and though we called to pick up our food, they didn't have it ready. But it's worth the wait.

OK so I'm giving this place an initial four stars after my first visit. I think they have great food, smells incredible, absolutely delicious. I had the Mason Dixon....half rack of ribs and a quarter chicken, with mac n cheese and creamed spinach. ?I have to say the creamed spinach was WAY too salty, and it was more watery than creamy. It did taste good, just too much salt. The meat was excellent. The pork was just starting to fall off the bone and the chicken wasn't dried out like most BBQ places. Good atmosphere, though the tables are a bit small for BBQ eating, especially if you get sides and drinks. Doesn't leave much room. *update* I would have liked to have had some true BBQ grill smokey-ness and char lines on the meat. Just doesn't seem quite like BBQ without that....you know? Definitely have go go back here more often

I saw a review on this new BBQ in the 2/12/2009 S.F. Chronicle/sfgate. It was a good review and well worth checking out. So I did yesterday. I couldn't find the place, at first, because the outside sign wasn't up yet. It's located where an old corner Rexall Drug Store used to be. Spacious and airy inside. The manager was extremely nice and friendly. Great lunch specials. Some of the prices were medium to high. I had the Razorback Platter (Memphis-style ?pork ribs combo with beef brisket. The beef brisket was pulled meat, like done with pork, rather than sliced. Both were tasty. ?I do wish the specials had 2 Fixins (sides) instead of one. Good selection of Fixins though. The potato salad I had was okay. I wish I would have tried one of the others. I love the cornbread. It was different, like it was baked in a grill pan. And moist with kernels of corn. I went for the dessert too. Only 3 of the 5 were available. The pecan pie I had was fine. I wish they had the Peach Betty. Besides not all desserts being available, some meal items were also not available. They are new, only opened for a month, and hope they iron out the kinks. They do have a full service bar with LCD TV too. Am sure it's popular with the El Rio and Roccapulco crowds from across the street. I would eat at Baby Blues again. But I do have a couple of other of my favorite S.F. BBQ's that I rate better. But Baby Blues was much needed in the Mission/Bernal neighborhoods where BBQ places are very, very few. It's in my neighborhood and convenient. During weekdays, not a prob to find metered parking along Mission Street.

i was really excited about this place. ?Especially when I saw the menu. ?I ?moved out to SF from Tennesse about 2 years ago and the SF version southern food, well, ?just isn't southern. ?Still great but just not the same. ?Missing all that fatty tastey goodness! Went for an early dinner (5ish) and the place wasn't crowded at all. ?Iit took quite some time for someone to wait on us until finally this guy took our order. ?They were already out of memphis style BBQ ribs and it wasn't even ?dinner service yet! ?Um what? not yet dinner service and your out of one of your main entrees? ?So I tried the babyback ribs instead with a side of coleslaw. ?Coleslaw was great but the ribs were kinda dry. ?Still good though My dinner companion had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. ?The mac n cheese was bland and colder than ?room temp. ? From previous experiences I have had at this place I just stick to the meat and coleslaw. ?A list of sides that I have experienced: Mashed potatoes - served to me cold and had alot of evaporated milk (could actually taste it) and doused in pepper to cover the milk taste. Collard greens - ?served cold not to mention......of all my years growing up into adulthood in the south i have NEVER EVER had collards with tomato juice. ?Ever. ?wtf? ?That goes into my wtf folder. Mac n cheese - served cold, no taste....at least they could have served it warm! Cornbread - moist, kinda sweet, dense, with corn kernels. ?Good! Coleslaw - they ?got this one right :-) it's fantastic! not to creamy, just the right amount of pepper, just yummy! Regular BBQ Sauce and the XXX Sauce - both very tastey. ? The biggest disappointment was ?that our server bailed ?in the middle of our dinner service and didn't tell anyone...including his fellow coworkers. ? We were left wondering if we would ever get our drinks refilled and the check. I hope all this is because the place is new and still working out the kinks! ?I'm going to give it another shot because I want this place to succeed!

Deeeelish! I had the pulled pork sandwich (terrific) with a side of beans (unspectacular) and my companion had the brisket (wish I'd ordered it, it was great) and cornbread. The lunch portions were more than generous. We came on the late-ish side (after 1) during the week for lunch and had no trouble getting a table, even though it was busy. Service was friendly. Did I mention we drank the Kool-aid? How can you not love a place that serves Kool-aid? Can't wait to go back and try the Suicide King!

California BBQ restaurants are like sirens that lure me in with their call as I drift disparagingly from one place to another. ?"You've never had OUR barbecue before. ?We're authentic", they muse as I foolishly order a sampling from their menu. ?Almost every time I'm left stranded on the shores of disappointment. I tried the brisket, pulled pork, Memphis-style ribs and chicken. ?No smoke flavor in any of them. ?Brisket was "pulled" or shredded like the pork, the ribs were bland and not very tender. ?The quarter section of the chicken was cooked just right but the breast meat was dry and crumbly. ?Overall, very bland meat, but that's because it was not barbecued, i.e. slowly cooked by heat and smoke. ?The sauces weren't bad and they are in squeeze bottles on every table. Potato salad tasted like boiled potatoes. ?The baked beans were creative with not just pinto beans but black and kidney as well. ?Mac n cheese was good but my friends make better. ?Cornbread was not that appealing and overly oiled. The one redeeming quality of this place is the banana pudding. ?It definitely tasted homemade and it was an ample portion. I'm sure the owners of this place a trying very hard to run a successful business but their competition has them beat. ?If you like this place make sure you check out Big Nate's, Memphis Minnie's, or Ironside to make comparisons on the quality of the meat. ?Side dishes are irrelevant if the meat isn't good. ?And if you really like Baby Blues after trying other places then consider yourself happy, for ignorance is bliss.

I was really excited to try this place as my rents currently reside in the south and I needed to find a good place to bring my dad when he comes to town. ? Went with a group of friends after happy hour at El Rio and they sat us at the bar, which is great by the way. ?Wood and stone mix that was super stylish and cozy. ?The bartender was pretty hot french, surfer looking guy. ?Great beer. ?It was Friday and busy so the clearing of plates was a little slow but the food and service made up for it. ? ?The owner came to greet and serve us...double plus. -Mags and I shared the Texas style baby back ribs: I felt they were a little fatty for what I was used to but Maggie was in pure heaven...see the photo -mashed sweet potatoes - these were perfect in all ways but slightly cold:( - mac n' cheese - great!...cheesey, tasty but a little bland - corn bread - Yuuummm!! ?this was awesome and will make me return -Chris had the baby back ribs Memphis and Shannon had the pulled pork and both were in my opinion better than the Texas Style Baby back ribs we ordered If I can say I will bring my dad here when he comes to town than I can say that I am a fan.

Really great BBQ, tasty beers, amazing effen sides, all in a fun atmosphere. We will be back. Plus: all the BBQ we had was perfectly done: tangy, smoky, fall of the bone goodness. The memphis ribs we're incredibly moist, and a great vehicle for the different sauces. We had five different sides, and they were all perfect. The best damn okra I've ever had. And the collard greens were prepared "stewed" so they come in a bit of broth. Super tasty and not at all heavy. Also, we got there a little before 730p on a Saturday night and got seated immediately. 20 minutes later and the place was packed, so recommend getting there a little earlier on busy nights. Finally, prices totally reasonable. With beers, we got out of there for under $25 each and were totally filled up. Minus: The dinner serving of the pulled pork was really skimpy. Not right. Also, they ran out of baby back ribs by the time we were there (which was early dinner). Kind of a bummer, but everything else was so good it didn't really matter.

I've eaten here a lot, as it's about 4 blocks from where I live. ?So, my three stars cover several 4, 3 and 2 star experiences. ?Oh, also, I'm really lazy, and this also covers several delivery experiences I've had with them. The pros: ?good beer selection and they are really good for BBQ pork and ribs. ?Also, mac and cheese is really really good. ?They also do a nice banana pudding, and their smoked rice is tasty as well. The cons: service all around has just been below par pretty consistently. ?Also, I got a BBQ chicken sandwich there before which was partially raw ... twice. ?When they cook their chicken properly, it's quite good, but I just don't want to risk a trip to the ER to enjoy my BBQ. They used to be my first choice to call when I was too lazy to get my own food.

I really enjoyed my meal here and look forward to going back. It was just solid BBQ. I like the interior. It's like hole-in-the-wall chic. Does that make sense? It's nice inside, but not more than you'd expect for a BBQ joint. I liked that about it. The service was good for us. My only complaint is a hole in the floor that was under my table. My bf's chair leg kept slipping into the 2vinch deep gorge, which was more jarring than it sounds. Either they can fill in the hole (good business) or never seat us at that table again. Seriously it's a hazard, but the foods great ?:)

On our quest for good BBQ in the city the best we found so far - ?Baby Blues BBQ. Service was great, friendly waiter, checked up on us and served us promptly. Place was clean and had a nice casual atmosphere. We first ordered : The baby blue - three meat with two sides. baby back ribs - seasoned and light sauce - tender and flavorful pulled pork - flavorful but could be a bit more tender - needs sauce chicken - tender flavorful, charred skin which is nice and crispy! mac and cheese - only part I didn't like - 90 percent cheese, 10 mac and needed salt coleslaw - good, light sauce, can really taste the cabbage then we ordered: Memphis Queen : 1/2 baby back ribs - see above YUMMY 1/2 Memphis rib - thicker, more tender, ?and smokier than the baby backs. In short, RIB HEAVEN. Didn't even need sauce Sweet potato - brown sugar, mashed and yummy. Almost could be dessert Creamed Spinach - good Corn - corn was really good, comes with blue cheese on it though doesn't need the cheese.

I had a great experience at Baby Blues. ?The food was great, the only thing that was a bit off was the beef brisket - It was overly moist and sort of tasteless, more like pot roast than brisket. ?Other than that, everything else (the chicken, the beef ribs, the fixins) were delicious. ?I highly recommend the mac n cheese, and the cornbread was really good. ? But more than the food, the service was fantastic. ?I had reserved for a party of 25, as we were celebrating a birthday. I was a bit nervous about that, since the place isn't the biggest, but I didn't need to be. My boyfriend and I were the first to arrive, 10 minutes early, and they seated us right away. ?No hassling about where the rest of our party was, or when we could expect them to arrive.

No one in our party had been to this restaurant before, but all of them told me that I had made a good pick. ?I would come back!

This is a perfect neighborhood spot! The staff here is so on point that it wouldn't matter if they switched to a soup kitchen...people go where the service is great! Paul's staff knows how to treat people and that is more than half of why I continue to eat there and recommend to my friends. Now for the BBQ...awesome..pulled pork sandwich tops my list however the catfish, Memphis ribs and brisket are all killer, and that's just the meat. Let me get this out of the way about the mac n cheese everyone loves....it's not possible to make quality mac n cheese in a place where people are waiting to eat..it takes time to bake PERIOD! and until I see how it's made I don't have any desire. However the rest of the sides GO. Collard greens, chicken rice, baked beans are official. I go here even when I don't really want BBQ because it feels like I am wanted there besides when the check comes. Doesn't hurt that Paul has Philly gear hanging:)

I am more into fine dining but I was pleasantly surprised by baby blues. Location: between mission and bernal heights... The crowd feels very local. Parking: street parking was easy. Staff: very friendly and helpful. I was debating between beef and pork so they gAve me two substantial samples to decide! Food: not bad at all. I had the Cherokee spike composed of home made sausage (a bit salty but good) and tasty beef brisket. The sauted okra was good. The corn bread was a delicious ...dessert lol ! Fluffy and sweet. My dish was quite filling and I couln't finish it. I think that I was stuffed by all the yummy fresh lemonade ( free refills). I took one star off because I think it is a bit pricey for the type of food and location. I would almost pay the same price for fine dining bistro downtown. Eating out in SF is becoming expensive!

A friend suggested we come here for lunch and indeed I will be returning. Started out with some meatballs for appetizers, and woah were them balls good! Definitely peaked my interest to order a burger next time around. The lingonberry sauce, was a perfect compliment to them. For my meal I ordered the beef brisket sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. The meat was shredded, placed on ciabatta bun, topped with coleslaw. I preceded to add a little spicy olive oil, and the garlic-ky bbq sauce. Mmm, mmm, so good. Had to cut it in half to prevent it from getting everywhere, but I finished that bad boy off. As for that mac and cheese, I'm a tough critic and I'll have to admit I didn't leave any behind. Although I ordered the beef brisket. my friends enjoyed a shrimp po'boy, and a pulled pork sandwich. Needless to say we left stuffed, happy, and fans of this old-school drug store turned restaurant. Definitely need to try their blackened catfish po'boy, amongst others. They've got plenty of favorites on tap (anchor steam) and some delicious desserts on the menu such as apple pie, peach cobbler, and banana pudding. Hey and if you like this place you can even grab a t-shirt to go (;

The only bad thing (right now-a week after they opened) is that they have a ton of junk on tables and chairs sitting in front of the window in site of diners: ?It looks so ugly. Employee crap, jackets, bike helmuts, just an unsightly pile of crap that should be moved NOW.

Really good Bar-Bee-Q !! Memphis style ribs and Texas ribs are great. ?Brisket is decent. ?The barbecue shrimp are awesome. Okra well cooked and not slimy at all. ?The Greens are a bit more tomatoey than I like but still very good. ?Corn bread is nice .. would be better with some jalapenos in it. When we were there, they were still working on the place ... so the ambiance could be better. ?But the service is good. ?Friendly people and good food

A completely nondescript entrance - outside of the neon BBQ sign above the double glass doors, who would have thought? ?but once you enter, the smell of bbq wafts wonderfully toward you. ?We sat by the kitchen and my only complaint is that there must have been a back door open, because I was freezing. ?But back to the food. ?AMAZING. ?the baby back ribs were so tender, they fell off the bone. ?the taste of the dry rub permeated the meat. ?SO good. ?We had a full rack of baby back ribs and a pulled pork platter to share. ?The fixins' we chose were cornbread, mac n cheese and baked beans. ?All home made and all so tasty. ?We finished our meal, again, homemade, peach cobbler. ?the sweet tea (southern style) was not as sweet as they warn...delish! ? But even better than the food??? ?the service - absolutely thoughtful and genuine. ?Can't get better than that! ?Great food and GREAT service!

OK so, I'm a southern boy from Mississippi and I rarely will even try BBQ in SF because it's never right. This is an exception! I went against the grain and tried the Catfish Poboy and couldn't have asked for a better sandwich. The catfish was blackened to perfection with a lovely cole slaw dressing. The brisket and pulled pork were also firing on all cylinders.

Delicious local bbq place if you live in the mission or bernal (or anywhere in the city for that matter!) The owner, Paul was super friendly and welcoming and the waitstaff was great. I had a 1/2 rack of ribs with blues on the cob and mac and cheese on the side. The portions were super generous that I had enough leftover for another meal. The sides i tasted were delicious - the two I ordered plus tasted my friends' mashed potatoes and beans. Although I'm not a huge meat eater, I thought the ribs were delicious and I loved the triple X hot sauce. Not sure what all the negative reviews commenting on the wait are for - our food came out in a normal amount of time and was well worth it! Will definitely be coming back here whenever I'm craving a huge delicious plate of meat =)

The place had some real potential, but they have some real issues to work out and they are a little expensive for what you get. First the pluses 1) Cool funky neighbourhood 2) Converted drugstore (even kept the sign) 3) Sides were pretty good (okra was a bit salty but yummy. Chicken smoked rice was good and you got a full cob of corn, not a half). Now the minuses 1) Place was pretty expensive for what you got. The Beef Rib with 2 sides is 22 bucks and that's for one rib! It's a big rib, but still just one. 2) Brisket was shredded, smothered in sauce and looked like pulled pork (brisket should be solid and done in a dry rub) 3) As there was no cornbread, we were told we were going to be given a free dessert. After ordering said dessert and getting the check, I noticed it was added to the check. They did take it off after I mentioned it. The problem is they are trying to skirt the fine line between hole in the wall and destination diner. You are better off going to a true hole in the wall BBQ place like The Rib Shack in San Bruno.

I've been to this place three times already and have never been disappointed. Had the Texas Style beef rib platter twice. The size of this rib is unbelievable--it's seriously like the rib the waitress gives Fred Flintstone in the show's opening sequence. The sides are great, especially the okra. Service has always been good. The wait staff is courteous and quick. Not to mention a few beautiful female servers. During my last visit, there was a tall brunette who was just amazing. Expect to wait for a table during the evening. Hey, it's a popular joint--what do you expect?

This place was great. I ordered a full slab of baby back ribs ($20) a la carte and they were phenomenal. They were cooked and smoked in a thick dry rub seasoning and bbq sauce was provided at the table in squirt bottles, after a hefty dousing of spicy bbq sauce and ginger and garlic tabasco sauce it was on! If you're into very saucy ribs this might not be for you, but even in a dry rub the ribs were very moist and fall off the bone. Definitely recommended. I ordered a side corn bread, but I wasn't a huge fan of it, it was a little moist and lacking in flavor. Also, the sweet tea i ordered was way too sweet, a little heavy handed with the sugar, it resembled corn syrup more than iced tea. But, all in all a rib joint should be rated on its ribs.. and if that's the case this place is definitely a winner.

Ok, I'll admit I've never had their BBQ but I'm a huge fan of their mac n cheese. I usually get it to go and it's only $3 for a sizable portion (it's seriously a meal by itself). Oh and don't forget to ask for some BBQ sauce to eat with the Mac, yummmm! The service could be a little better. One time this waitress was making out with her bf while my mac and cheese sat there getting cold, tisk tisk.

I just had my birthday party here last Saturday night (10/10/09), and i must say...I come here all the time, and this time the food was just ggggggrrrrrreeeeeaaaaaatttttt!!!!! Paul and Sharon (owners) are really great, they made my birthday dinner so fantastic. I kept in contact with Paul, and just told him that I wanted to order 3 Extravaganza Feed Bags..and he made it happen. There was about 60 people at the dinner, and he made the space for us..and the food just kept on coming out.. The Memphis ribs, baby back ribs, the chicken, brisket, and pulled pork was just perfect bbq! I had a chance to meet with Sharon ?before dinner while she was still preparing all of the food and the food was great! All of the sides with the dinner were just so mnouth-watering..collard greens, corn on the cob, okra, baked beans, mac n cheese, and the sweet mashed potato's..all i can is Mmmmmm... This place is great! it's not the typical kind of restaurant..this place is very unique and has a very "home-comfy" type of feel. The servers are freindly and just so on top of everything! Quinn and Paul's daughter was so helpful! But their lunch special are a great deal as well..the food is so filling..make sure you go here with a slight "hunger" appetite! It's well worth the $! As for the parking, if you go during lunch hours, it may be easier to find street parking, otherwise, you can be driving around for a good 30 mins trying to look for a spot..but keep in mind, you can always park at the Blockbuster parking lot just north of the restaurant..for a low cost fee of course..but like i said, it's so worth it!

I had been here twice before and found things to be okay but this week's "dinner" will be the last visit. - Cold chicken (yes, folks it's cooked well in advance of dinnertime. The waiter revealed after I questioned when it was cooked) - 85 degrees in the restaurant and no ventilation - No manager working that night (who is running this place?) - No offer to compensate for the cold and dry chicken - Sent email via web site before posting here and no response. Good luck Baby Blues.

BB is almost like our living room, not only because of its proximity to our apt but also because we have been eating there often. ? What I like: Baby back ribs, the ginger rib sauce, and for sides: creamed spinach, okra, and mac n' cheese. ?The atmosphere is family-oriented in the early evening and changes to a friendly local bar into the night. ?Also, the owner is often around and very welcoming. ? What could improve: One time (out of 15?) our take-out order was botched and it took them a while to fix it, but it was the week of the World Series and BB was full of game watchers, so I forgave them. ?Another time we ordered a larger-boned rib they had on special (per the owner's suggestion) and it was incredibly fatty, so now we stick to our favorites.

First, I didn't eat the desserts (others in my party did the banana pudding but didn't finish it which says it all), nor did I have any of the homemade iced tea or lemonade (Diet Coke is what I drink with bbq). I had the Memphis Queen, baked beans and creamed spinach. ?The ribs were good--but no better than other places. ?The baked beans didn't appear or taste "baked"--just cooked on the stove and I had to add some of the XX bbq sauce on the table to dish it up (and I normally don't like hot spice). ?Skip the creamed spinach. ?However, I did taste my friend's okra and that was EXCELLENT (and you know how hard it is to cook good okra). ?All in all, it was a good experience, wait staff was good without being overly sweet or solicitous, food came pretty quickly (it was lunch and we got there early). ?I don't know if I'd make the trek again if someone didn't drive me though. ?I do love the neighborhood.

One of the worst meals I've had in SF in years. The heavily inked wait staff were friendly but not well organized; no clearly delineated responsibility for our table, for starters. Baby back ribs were warm rather than hot, bone-dry, and unsauced (with sauces on the table for ex post facto application). ?BBQ chicken breast was overdone. ?Sides of slaw and so-called caesar salad were ordinary at best. Cornbread was slightly undercooked. Menus and floors were not clean. It's in my neighborhood, but with better Mexican/Salvadorian/Peruvian/Chinese/Vietnamese choices within a couple blocks, I'll never return.

You know I want to love this place and I'll go back again because I like the ambiance there's plenty of seating and a good bar but the food is just okay. ?It's average. which I didn't really expect. ?The first time I had the pork pulled sandwich and if you like a lot of pork then this is a 4+ star sandwich but I thought it lacked flavor. ?The next time I ordered the beef ribs, first mistake, it's the beef RIB (singular). ?One Flintstone sized somewhat meaty rib for $23.00 plus 2 sides. ?Really, $23 for one rib! ?I love beef ribs and this one while tasty was entirely unmanageable. ?I won't order it again. ?I've also had the mac n' cheese, Cesar salad, and corn bread sides - all okay. ?The portions are large, surprising in any SF restaurant so that's nice. ?All in all, a good place when I want a beer and a bite in the Mission but not on my list for favs.

Good bbq in SF is hard to find and these guys know how to do it. My favorites are the Memphis ribs, pulled pork, okra and greens. There is also free range chicken on the menu. They have a decent beer selection as well. Can be a good place to watch a weekday game at the bar. The El Rio is across the street for additional good times.

Ok I read a write up on Daily candy about this place so i drove over to check it out. ?I got there about 3ish ,but they were still setting up for business at 5. First of, the guys who own and run the place are F-ing great. They prepare some ribs and shrimp for me before they were ready to open. While I was waiting, they offered me a beer and great convo about the place and their backgrounds. I was very impressed with the guys and what they want to do with the business. So when I got my food home, OMG!! The ribs were great, and the rice was awesome as well. Alot of the food on the menu was not ready yet , b/c of my early arrival, but I'm going back next weekend and I plan on trying everything I can. Please If you want good BBQ in San Francisco, GO TO BABY BLUES BBQ! ?You will not be sorry.

I'm not from the south, but I lived in North Carolina for a few years in which time I became a huge fan of Carolina BBQ and all the trimmings... Baby Blues doesn't really have Carolina Q, and you can tell they are still getting up on their feet over there, but this is a quick summary of my first impressions: Food = 3 stars. The pulled pork was super tender and juicy and a generous portion, but no real seasoning that I could taste, just straight up pork. There was a good sauce on the table, but I'm still in search of the vinegar-based sauce; I think it would be a great addition to this dish. The slaw was just right, not too mayo-y. They were out of mashed sweet potato, so i tried the mac and cheese- no slouch! Frankly, I don't expect gourmet mac and cheese from a BBQ joint (go to Blue Plate for that), this was just fine. The cornbread needs work - I recommend go simple and traditional, stick to salty and light (this slice was neither). My beau's side of mashed potatoes was quite good, and the okra was fabulous. I mean it - really, really good okra. Finished with banana pudding - really mostly whipped creamy, very few bananas. I'd beef up the banana next time around. and the nilla wafers. Atmosphere = 3 stars. Good music, good lighting. I like the open kitchen/grill area and the large wooden tables (are any family-style seating?) I think Baby Blues could probably go even more simple with the presentation - I don't need a candle on the table of my BBQ joint, and it's not that dark in there anyway. I do, however, need room on the small tables for all that food! Service = 4 stars. Baby Blues is still trying to figure out how to balance in-house orders with large delivery and take out orders, so we experienced a long (long) delay getting our food, similar to what some others have written about. But you know what? They recognized the problem, acknowledged it honestly, brought us our sides ahead of time upon request, and also gave us complimentary drinks and a dessert to thank us for our patience. More than one waitress came to apologize and see that we had what we needed. Very cool. We will definitely be back to check it out again in a few weeks after things have settled down and the service and kitchen get some more practice on their routine.

MMMMmmmmm HHmmmm! I will say that I have only tried the pulled pork as the main dish, but to be fair I think this is one of those places where I will never be able to convince myself to try anything else. I like to mix the vinegar with both the XXX and the regular BBQ sauce and get messy! As far as sides go... the slaw is the bomb, as are the baked beans (done with a three bean medley), okra, and collard greens. Mac n cheese and corn bread are pretty good although I've for sure had better. This past trip we got to try some desserts too. Although the peach betty, chocolate kahlua cake, and banana pudding were all damn tasty, it was the pudding that brought tears to my eyes. Add to all this tasty food attentive service and Guinness on tap and you can call me a convert!

The ribs, pulled pork, brisket, chicken, sides - everything was very good or excellent. Service was with a smile too Look folks, good BBQ does not require sauce and I did not use a drop.

You have a choice, listen to all the "haters" who have given Baby Blues anything under 3 stars or you can go and review this place yourself. I have been a devoted customer since they opened, and I have to admit, I am under some kinda hocus pocus; Baby Blues BBQ on the corner of Mission and Precita Street has me under a spell... bbq spell that is. Since moving to Bernal Heights, I wanted to see what the neighborhood had to offer as to local feed and a great laid back, chill vibe, with nice and attentive people to feed me, Baby Blues BBQ is this place. I thought to myself, I'd go in, check out the menu with no expectations or decisive decisions and go from there. I sat down at one of the bar stools at the counter. Immediately I was greeted like I was already a regular. What to order from such a vast selection of delicious goodness off the menu, I couldn't decide, so I asked for some advice (always ask the staff at a restaurant what they would suggest off the menu; I heard this tactic on Rachel Ray's show "$40-a-Day"). That's when I met Danny and Paul, owners of BBBBQ. Danny, who owns their sister restaurant in Los Angeles, suggested a few choices from the menu. Nothing really caught my ears, so I cut to the chase, "Do you have anything that is juicy, tangy, mouthwatering that is totally fatty and meaty at the same time?" That's when Danny pointed out the "Texas-style BEEF RIB". I was kinda reluctant because of the price of $21.95, but with two side dishes and corn bread, I thought I'd try it. OMFG, this brontosaurus sized beef rib was AMAAAZING!!! And, in my experience, when you can cut a piece of meat with a fork without a knife, that's when you have to ask yourself, "why haven't I run into this place before? TRUST me, you will not be disappointed. Thanks to Baby Blues BBQ for feeding me the very best in well smoked, grilled to perfection choice cuts of meats, tasty side dishes and most importantly, for one of the nicest group of restaurant employees I've met in a longtime. Read all the reviews you want, the good and the bad, but know this, if you want great BBQ at reasonable prices and want an attentive staff that goes out of their way to satisfy every customer, Baby Blues BBQ on Mission Street is the place to find it.

I made the mistake of buying two much. I was only able to eat 1/2 of what i ordered. I had 1/2 bbq, that was great. Not a fan of the collard greens, Im used to more vinegar with mine. Mac and cheese was ok. Not bad, but not great. ?I definately will be back for lunch.

Went here last night for the first time and had the baby back ribs platter, with sides of okra and creamed spinach (and a corn muffin). The ribs were amazing. Smoky and falling off the bone, crisp and juicy. There are three sauces to choose from: mild, hot, and a tabasco-ginger sauce. All of the sauces were great. The sides I chose were good, but I should have gotten the macaroni and cheese (really!) which my friend let me taste. The only disappointment was the cornbread, which was not sweet enough and a little stale-tasting. They also have a great beer selection, including my current fave Fat Tire, and Guinness on tap.

We ordered a mix of pretty much everything. The ribs were a little dry and tough. The pulled pork and brisket were good and amazing when doused with the "XXX" sauce! Mac n' Cheese, rich and delicious. Baked beans, good. Mashed potatoes, nothing to brag about. Cornbread, thick and hearty. Service, attentive and attractive. As picky as I'd like to be about my BBQ, I'm not sure any restaurant can capture that backyard, smoky, grilled taste. Nevertheless, Baby Blues is a good BBQ joint. I will be back.

Yes, I'm from the south. And yes, this BBQ is the real thing. I love this place- we've been there 4 times in the last 2 weeks.... Usually BBQ that you find on the west coast is honey/molasses based- which creates a sugary experience whether it's ribs or chicken. BB's has a nice vinegar based sauce (actually 3 types-) that complements the meats perfectly. And the sides... cornbread is good. Potato salad is better. Creamed spinach is delicious. The only side I wasn't crazy about was the collared greens. And on top of all that, this is a family run place with a good crew and a good guy running the joint. Check it out.

A friend suggested this place because he new the owner. ?I thought this was just gonna be another ordinary BBQ place. ?When we first got there you could smell the BBQ cookin! One look at the menu and it was pretty difficult to choose (so many choices). ?It was a good thing we had someone there that had been there before. The first surprise that I had was they had Kool Aid on the menu. ?This is the first and only place that I know that sells kool aid. I shared the plate that came with 4 different types of meats. ?We had the Texas Rib, pulled pork, Hot links and beef brisket. ?We also had Pork and beans, mac & cheese (a must have) and sweet potato mash. ?there was also 3 different types of BBQ sauce and a vinegar sauce as well. Lastly, we had saved some room for a little dessert. ?We had the banana pudding. ?This totally topped the meal off. ?I could have ate the whole dessert myself. ?

Went here the other night, and this place is just ok. The sauces were "ho-hum", a little too watered down for my taste. The collard greens were soggy, and didn't look fresh at all. I mean is it that hard to screw up vegetables?? Also, Mac & Cheese.... C'mon, were talking about some noodles in cheese sauce! This is not rocket science! Sure you have to add your own flavors to it to make it your own, but lets just start with the basics..... NOT over boiling the noodles, and then letting them sit inside of their now curdling cheese sauce concoction. Service was pretty slow even though there were like 10 people in the joint. I guess if you don't actually know someone there, you automatically get shuffled into some service black hole. If your going to charge SF prices, shouldn't you at least get SF service quality?? The baby back ribs I had were cooked very good, at least they got this right. And my girlfriends chicken was very tasteful. This is why they are getting 2 stars. If they improve their side dishes (Don't get me started on the cornbread. Can you say "cornbread with a gallon of your finest brew, please!), and their service, this would be a very good place to go. Also, please take another look at the recipes for your BBQ sauces, decrease the water content by about 1/2 would be a good start. Stand by for my comments about my next visit!

The BBQ here definitely has real Southern flare to it. I like when the restaurant owner or the staff put some thoughts to their food. The food has its soul and it shows from the taste. The ribs are delicious and with all those rich&spicy house made sauces --i don't care if that means 1 hour of cardio, count me in any day. so 4 stars for the food..but Baby Blues got an extra star cas of the variety selections..sides etc. and the helpful staff. Our server is very knowledgeable. He told us to give couple drops of their cider/vinegar on beef brisket, pulled pork or corn bread..and i love it!! the combination of all flavors work wonderfully! The price is somewhat steep but the quality of the food is well worth it. Go for their lunch plate specials which r more affordable when u r on the tight budget.

Today I received a second order (delivered) from Baby Blues. I was very happy and overjoyed with the bbq shrimp and ribs. I ordered mac-n-cheese and rice as the sides - the rice was good but the mac-n-cheese, well..it was ok. I was impressed by the delivery driver: Julian. He was friendly and even called to verify the address. I am looking forward to ordering again. I am glad that they have delivery.

Yum, Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum yum. ? I love the meat. ?I love the sauces. ?I love the long wooden table. ?I have been there for a large birthday party, and several times with just the family; and, had great meals every time. ?Also, it is a great place to take a toddler / preschooler because of the noise and activity levels. ? The only thing that would make this place better is offering Whiskey!

4.5 stars! I've been to this restaurant place twice and I'd totally go back again. The first time I came here was because my bf and me wanted to get some yummy bbq so we yelped it and found that baby blues had pretty good reviews. This was back in February. We ordered the ribs and chicken with creamed spinach, cole slaw and corn bread to go. The chicken was ok. A little dry without the sauce. The ribs and creamed spinach on the other hand was YUMMY. The warm cornbread was also good. It had actually corn pieces in it! We like this place so much we decided to come here again for my bf b-day party in July. We had a party of 23 people and we were able to fit at one of the hightop tables in the back. It was a little squished but alright. I think 20 people would have fit comfortably. So anyways, apparently if you have a big group you kind of have to order the group orders or it will take forever for them to cook 20 individual orders. We ended up ordering "the Extravaganza" (3 full rack Memphis, 3 full rack baby backs, 2 full birds, 2lbs pulled pork, 2lbs brisket, 5 sides (2lbs each), 20 cornbreads). 3 people in our group order their own dishes because they wanted to try something else. For the sides we got: 1. cole slaw - good I hear. I'm not a cole slaw person so I didn't try it 2. mashed sweet potatoes - yummy. I like sweet potatoes. =) Not super special but good. 3. creamed spinach - yummy. I had to get this one again. 4. mac n cheese - really yummy from what I heard from people who actually got to eat it. This was first to run out. 5. chicken smoked rice - nothing special. I wouldn't get it again. We totally ran out of yummy sides! However, overall the food was just enough to feed our group comfortably. The service was 5 stars! The waiters and owner periodically checked up on us to make sure everything was ok. =) Oh, I did dock half a star because the meat was inconsistently cook. Some said ribs were dry, but some not. Some say chicken a little dry other said moist. Kind of depended on where you sat since they split the meat into 3 food platters. The owner is really nice and understanding. We had a cake and they refrigerated it for us as well as provide candles. =) Also, in the beginning some ordered soda cause they thought there wasn't alcohol but wanted to cancelled to order alcohol instead and they were really nice about it too. Esp. they already brought out the drinks. ? Note: We made reservations (contrary to the info listed above).

This place is one of my favorites. ?Hands down. From the long tall tables to gather with friends to ordering online and chowing down in front of the TV in PJs--you can't go wrong. Chicken=Awesome. ?Shrimp=Awesome. ?Burger=Awesome. ? TX Beef Ribs aka. Caveman Stick=AWESOME. ? Throw in Blue Moon on tap and some spicy sauce, and I'm in heaven.

the first time i went here i was not much of a fan.....but, because of friends i have been back several times and it has really grown on me. ?The must haves are the prawns, the ribs and there is this huge brontasaurus rib...I don't know what it's called but it's amazing! ?We went there last night and had such a great time. ?I even brought my 6 month old and they were super accomodating...she had a great time too, but then again...she likes to party.

Love Baby Blues and come here often, everything is really good. I love the suicide kings. Its tough to find good of meat in San Francisco, where everyhting usually has to be politically correct but its nice to have a good bbq. That being said, I would never take a vegetarian here, even though they have a ton of veggie sides to accomodate. The owner has always always been really friendly and the staff seems on top of it. They just put in a kids area which i think it a really nice touch for all the familes in the city

I usually write reviews solely based on the quality of food. There are just too many factors that can go into determining service and other things. At the end of the day, it's about the food. I'm a Texas transplant so I like to think I'm good judgement of BBQ and I think Baby Blue's is close but just doesn't quite knock it out of the park. Let's talk about what they do right. The ribs are awesome. Good flavoring but you definitely need to sauce it. The hot link is legit as is the chicken (It's really hard to mess up chicken on the bone) The pulled pork only ok. Needs some more flavoring. ? Brisket should always be sliced, so you can see the smoke rings but this is more jumbled. The cornbread is more of a corn pudding and there's a funky flavor to it that I can't quite point out. I like my corn break light, fluffy and a bit sweet (while adding butter and honey). Now Sauces... tied for the most important part of BBQ. I really like the molasses sweet sauce. this goes great with just about everything. The other sauces, however, seems to not go with much. I must point out that two of them have Tobasco and I'm not a fan of Tabasco flavor in BBQ. For sides, the potato salad is legit, the corn on the cob is awesome. The okra is surprisingly yummy but I didn't care of the mac and cheese. SUPER heavy and a bit of blue cheese. The deserts looked awesome but I was full. Hope this helps!

After many recommendations and a miserable zip code vs. bank records failure last Sunday, I finally got to give Baby Blues a go while drinking at home on Valentine's day. I grubhubbed my order and waited patiently for the 8:50 delivery time. A few minutes later an emailed informed me of my new delivery time of 8:22... excellent. I lost track of most time until 8:19 when I was sent psychic bbq messages to prepare my money and an appropriate tip if he or she anointed to the great task of delivering my hot bbq dinner on Valentine's day was to come right... the buzzer rings. Great golly be scotts, wilikers! I hobble down a flight of stairs while he pants his way up one where we meet for a quick exchange of food and useless paper representing the promise of a tomorrow. I return to my empty round table and head straight for the ribs. Disappointed at first by the notion of only three ribs constituting a third of a rack I rescinded my previous thoughts about halfway through the second that was already filling my moderate meat quota of the day. Licking my fingers off of my left hand first seemed a smart-witted way of reaching quicker toward the three remaining presents that awaited me, all wrapped in a clear plastic tupperware that both shared surprises, yet gave no indication of what final enjoyment could be made of them. The mashed potatoes first... no gravy... perhaps they would have given me some if I had included it in special instructions but silly me for assuming such. Mac n' cheese is up, opened and forked. It's separated a little, testament to it's main ingredient, CHEESE! I've had better but I wouldn't have had enough space in my mouth to complain to imaginary friends that may have been sitting around me. The final tub brings me back into meat heaven with a heaping stack of pulled pork that makes me contemplate the purpose in those many years of my life that I shunned pork in some of it's most delicious forms. I may have been set back a little in my side choices but what they do right they do damn right. As I top it off with bites off my cornbread I realize that they saved the best for a surprising end as this moist corny goodness bursts with the buttery flavor that strangely makes me think of a french recipe that they're somehow passing off ?as a sauce despite the ingredients include butter and water, that is steamed away.

Eight of us went to eat here a couple of nights ago and to our suprise, we were seated after only a short wait. ?We ordered the Teaser Plate which was, as it says on the menu, enough for 8 people. ? The restaurant was packed so it took a little time before we got our food but the owner came by our table and offered us a free round of drinks for the extra wait. ? All of us enjoyed the food very much. ?The only gripe I have is that the four side dishes that came with the Teaser Plate were small (same size as the individual portions) and not enough to share by everyone in our group. ? I'm definitely going back for more!

There are not enough good BBQ restaurants in SF. I work in the Ingleside District, and it was nice to see Baby Blues open up. This place is KILLER! I met the owner who is the nicest guy around. He treats his staff really well. I really wasn't sure what to order, so i asked him what he recommended. He himself was on lunch break, but he graciously stopped eating, and with a smile on his face said, "I got just the thing for you". 5 minutes later he brought out a platter full of 5 different meats, several side dishes. The meat and ribs were amazing!!! My favorite side dishes were the mac and cheese (it has melted blue cheese in it) and the shrimp! It was amazing. After we chomped everything down, he brought us a dessert sampler. The key lime was amazing, as was the peach cobbler. My fav however was the banana pudding. it was to die for. Its a good atmosphere, great employees, great owner. I read a few other reviews, and how they said that the food took long, the orders were messed up... Guys! give them time, The restaurant just opened, and I'm sure they are going to have kinks, but boy the food makes up for it. Once they get up and running, i can see Baby Blues taking off!

Ok, let's get right into it. The good, the bad and the ugly. The good: ?I had the BBQ Chicken sandwich and it was just great. ?I loved the slaw on it. It wasn't a gross mayo puddle and it wasn't just chopped cabbage - it was just right. ?The bread, um - yum. ?The chicken was perfectly done with just the right amount of spice and zing. ?I wanted to try the table top sauces but I didn't need them. ?I also ordered a side of baked beans (there is no one on the planet that has had more than me). ?They were so good! ?Three different kinds of beans and so flavorful! The bad: ?Service. ?They are trying but not organized at all. ?So friendly and working hard but they really need to just get things in order. ?All of the supplies they need to operate efficiently are just scattered everywhere and they are just running into each other. ?I felt bad because it's such an easy fix. The ugly: ?My face when I realized I finished my whole plate clean. To sum the place up - go if you are not in a hurry and want to enjoy good food in Bernal!

3.5 stars (rounded up because I am at least happy to see a BBQ joint in my hood). This place is decent - not great - but decent. Atmosphere: Feels mostly like a BBQ joint should (no frills), but hedges it's bets with a flat screen TV that screams "Sports Bar", and the "Drugs" signs out front feel like a concession to all the Mission hipsters (despite having nothing to do with Baby Blues). ?Played blues on the stereo, which was fitting - I would love to see them book some live blues on nights or weekends. Food: ?Let it be known that I can smoke a mean rack of ribs. ?Naturally, I had the baby back ribs here with beans and slaw. ?The ribs were tender, but not as juicy or smokey as they should ideally be. ?There was no sign of the meat being pink (which occurs as the meat absorbs smoke during the que'ing process). ?Also the sauce on the outside was chared. ?This leads me to wonder if they just boiled or cooked the ribs in an oven (opposed to actually smoking them) and then slapped some sauce on it and warmed them up on a grill. ?The beans and slaw were unique and pretty tastey. ?Props for offering sweet tea and kool aid on the menu. Overall not a bad place to get your BBQ fix. ?I will go back.

After two visits to Baby Blue, it's time to write a review. Usually I prefer to visit a place several times to draw conclusions, but hey here I am at the laptop with nothin to do... Our first visit had mixed results. ?Our party gave high praise to the 'fixins', which is what they call their $3.75 ea. sides, while the guys working the grill were obviously novices having burned two of four plates of ribs. Two weeks later we found ?what was probably their franchise broiler cook schooling the fellas on the grill. Both Memphis style pork ribs and baby backs came to us perfecto. They provide two types of bbq sauce at the table in squeeze bottles, regular and XXX. We all gave them good marks. Not being from the south or anything close to being a bbq officionado, just a boy with an appetite, I was well pleased with the ribs. Our second visit found changes in the fixins, some good some bad. The potato salad which I absolutely adored, had gone south. My first bite was raw onion, bitter, sharp, unpleasant. Lots of skins in there ?as well from the red potatoes. I remembered the sweetness of the first visit. The onion definitely overpowered the flavor profile. The cornbread was different this time too. It was not as dense as our first visit, which I happened to like. The mac 'n cheese was different, this time very wet, the flavor needed some punch. Our first visit it really popped with a nice crust on the top which was missing. Purist will not like the collard greens in a tomato sauce, but I loved it! Great flavor. Sweet Potato salad was excellent as well. I didn't reorder baked beans this time, however on the first visit I thought they didn't resemble anything like baked beans I had ever come across, which in and of its self is okay, however flavor was lacking in my opinion. Don't miss desserts! Especially if you love banana pudding like I do! I savored every bite! The pecan pie was very tasty as well. I was very happy to see Trumer ale on tap, which they serve in these cool, slender glasses, as well as Guiness. Guiness and BBQ...I like it! Overall our party was very satisfied with our meals. The kitchen will work out the kinks I do believe and this place will continue to improve. Just please rinse those onions fellas before you put them in the potato salad! I would be remise if I didn't mention the very good servers we have had. Very friendly and accomodating...all family members of the owner. We will definitely be going back when it's time for bbq.

I can rest easier now that SF finally has a place to get my bbq fix. Anyone who is addicted to bbq will have their own particular needs, but as a fan of the Pig and Carolina style sauce Baby Blues is Nirvana. That's not to say they don't do an amazing job with the other meats and seafood - the shrimp were a delicious surprise: Jumbo shrimp, super smokey yet still moist; Brisket is more like shredded beef, still deelish but don't expect sliced slabs. I preferred the Baby back ribs over the Memphis the night we were there, they just seemed meatier and moister. The selections of sides are bountiful - ?there are enough choices that you're sure you to find just the prefect combo to go with your meats. Collards are a little tough, I prefer 'em soft but the spinach was perfect, don't let the term 'creamed' put you off. Mac n' cheese is a nice counterpoint to the bbq sauces. Cornbread was different than any I've had, not my favorite but so what? the rest of the meal was divine. Pie? another addiction and none here to disappoint. Pecan Pie was truly homemade perfect and Key Lime even better than mine. Only thing they could reconsider - ?adding whipped cream to the menu. Really, Pecan Pie without whip? OK to sum up: 2 people split a Blue Devil - 4 meats/3 sides We chose Memphis & Baby Back Ribs, Brisket and Shrimp, collards, creamed spinach & mac n' cheese. This was enough to be stuffed and still have leftovers to soften the pangs of withdrawal. With 2 pies and 2 drinks the bill came in under $50. Hot Damn!

By far the BEST BBQ place in SF. No doubt. The meat was tender, almost falling off the bone & tasty. Sides- I had mac n cheese it was the BOMB. just enough cheese not too sweet and the serving size was plenty. I also had sweet potato mash...really fantastic. Not as sweet as other places but seasoned just enough. To drink I had a slammmin half lemonade/iced tea and it was also just delightful!!! Our service was on point, everyone was smiling. So if you like BBQ that is not over the top sweet and smothered in sauces, this is the place to go. If you mix the XXX spicy sauce and the plain BBQ sauce it's really good too!

Really bums me out to write a bad review for a place that does seem to make a LOT of folks happy. But ... duty calls. Be forewarned - I'd suggest NOT phoning in an order ahead of either picking up or eating there. The staff is just not capable of doing much more than delivering food to tables, I guess. Phoned in the order for pick-up, stating (more than 3 times) that I needed enough food for 3 people. The guy on the phone just couldn't grasp the concept and was only looking for me to ask for specific menu items. I told him (again) that I was driving and didn't have a menu ... blah, blah, blah. Anyway, you've all been there. Long story short - ended up with the "Big Blue" - three very small dry pork ribs; one link and a plastic cup of shredded beef; sides included plastic cups of cole slaw, sweet potatoes and beans. Grand total $32 ... enough food for one moderately hungry person, but really poor quality BBQ. Won't be back.

A group of 5 of us ate at Baby blues sat. night..to celebrate a b-day.. First of all ..the table and wobbly stools were uncomfortable! ?The disco music was blasting from ceiling speakers and it was hard to talk or hear one another ..So we were least looking forward to a great meal.. I had the baby back ribs which were tasty..then it went down hill.. others in group ordered the BB chicken dry & salty...My wife had the memphis ribs..fatty & greasy!!..All the side dishes are AWFUL! the cole slaw and baked beans taste like cheap cafeteria food... watery and bland..The corn bread is soggy and salty..If you must eat here ..suggest taking your own side dishes with you or just do take-out with the baby back ribs only..AND you ?might want to wear ear plugs if the music is blasting..

So to be fair...I have a hard time giving higher than 3 stars when I feel completely disgusting after a meal - even if I enjoyed every moment of it. The service was great, and I'm sure the food was good as well. "Sure" because when I'm overloading on stuff like this, I'm just not very sure. Everyone I know had already been to Baby Blues so I decided to finally check it out. I shared the pulled pork sandwich and the bbq chicken sandwich along with the "blues on the cob" and the mac n cheese. The sandwiches were fine, but they were saved by the "ginger tabasco" sauce. I poured as much of it as possible on both sandwiches and wanted to sneak the sauce home with me as well. The corn on the cob was delicious with cheese sprinkled on top and a squirt of lime. The mac n cheese was too cheesy - not in a good way but in a stale way. I don't feel like I need to go back; however, if I did, I would have half of what I decided to order on this visit. Order easy!

All right, I've finally had to write a review of this place after being there several times. ?The meat here is good, some of it really good -- the Memphis and baby backs are totally solid, and their sauces (the ribs come unsauced, as is God's will) are varied and delicious. ?The interior is laid back and cool, there's a TV with sport on behind the bar, and parking on the street is easy as pie. ?(More on pie below) Here's the reason this place doesn't get 4 or even 5 stars from me. ?When I want Southern food, what I want is Southern food. ?I am from the South, and I know how to make and eat Southern food. ?And at most junctures, this place seems to make the wrong decision, deciding instead of hallowed tradition to take some sort of imagined nouvelle take on whatever they are serving. ?The sweet tea is made with brown sugar. ?BROWN SUGAR? ?WHAT? ?It's terrible. ?The poboys are dressed with cole slaw. ?Their okra is stewed (which is, to be fair, delicious), but whatever happened to a little cornmeal and cayenne and a deep fryer? ?Their banana pudding is mostly a thick whipped mess that tastes a little like banana. ?Their pecan pie is a pecan square that lacks the 1/2-inch cornsyrupy middle layer required by law every place south of the M-D. God knows I love creativity in cuisine, but this is not the cuisine for it. ? I'm sticking with 3 stars until they scale back their adaptations a little.

So anyone who is dissing this place before it has even fully opened is just mean-spirited. ?They will be open soon for regular business soon, and then you can judge them on what they have or how fast they serve you or how yummy the food is. I give five stars because I was at an early soon-to-be-open event and what I tasted was great. ?Soft moist corn bread, fresh and diverse baked beans, great mashed potatoes (both kinds), terrific ribs and shrimp and super eager to please and friendly service. So, ignore the negativity and be prepared for great BBQ in Bernal Heights when these guys finally get going.

I REALLY wanted to love this place. Its so close to my house and, growing up near one of the barbecue capitals of America, I am a huge fan of the stuff. However, I was sorely disappointed. I won't rate them on the service/atmosphere - which were not good - because they just opened. Those things will work themselves out, I'm sure. I will, however, rate them on the food - which was also not good. I ordered the combination plate - 3 meats, 2 sides and cornbread. I tried to order a sweetened tea and was told they didn't have tea yet ( no tea? I'm pretty sure that's just tea bags, sugar and water requiring no high tech piece of equipment), so water it was. Now, there are lots of different styles of barbecue - Texas, Kentucky, Memphis, The Carolinas etc. The one thing they all have in common is that rich, smokey, slow-cooked flavor. That flavor was nowhere to be found in the three meats I sampled. The best of the three where the baby back ribs, which were tender but mostly flavorless. My guess is they were mostly boiled and then seared (possibly lightly smoked) but had no barbecue flavor. The pulled pork was completely tasteless (where is that beautiful, almost burnt, caramelized skin you should see on any well barbecued meat?)and the brisket (which was pulled) tasted like it had been sitting in water to keep it moist. It was by far the worst of the three. Every good BBQ cook knows that if you have to slather it in sauce to be edible, you've got problems. The sides went from nondescript and undercooked (collard greens) to strange (black, pinto and kidney?) and tasteless (Baked beans). The corn bread was like no other I've ever tasted (either made with white or yellow cornmeal) and not in a good way. Having said all that, I might actually have given the place another shot...if it wasn't so crazy expensive. The exact same amount of food (and better quality, I might add) can be had at any number of barbecue restaurants in the city for around $16.95. The total for the "Big Blue" was $25.95. If you are going to charge those prices - you should be able to back it up with quality. I hate giving a bad review - I mean, look at how few I've given - but this place needs to step it up. Until then - I have to say avoid it.

If the food wasn't so good I probably wouldn't come back because the service is just ... what's a good word for horrible? Actually, it was much better the first time I ate here when there were a few White men working rather than whoever was working earlier. (No comment)

Baby Blues BBQ is now open as of 12/26/08. Too bad it doesn't really matter. I came here as soon as they opened so that I could try, yet again, to have great BBQ in the bay area. Yet again, I have failed. I don't know why it's impossible to cook and serve great smoked 'cue in this part of the country...but apparently it is. The food was...average/not-so-great. The pulled pork was a lame attempt at north carolina-style 'cue that came out sweet, yet bland. The vinegar-type sauce they provided fell short of rescuing it. The brisket was...NOT EVEN BRISKET. It was like "pulled beef" or something. They advertised texas brisket and it's not even sliced, true-blue brisket in any sense. It was actually kinda tasty, but who cares...it's not brisket! The XXX hot sauce was not mind-blowing hot, nor was it anything more than a limited imitation of Texas Peet's hot sauce. Lastly, we had the baby back ribs. These were actually good. The only redeeming part of the meal. Go for these ribs, and don't bother with anything else. The ribs were actually great. Pricey for the Mission, but great. Now...the service. I don't usually write about the service at any place where a meal is less than $20. I don't really care in these situations. But Baby Blues made me care. So here I am writing about it. We waited 10 minutes to get anybodys attention. We couldn't sit because they hadn't bussed the tables that were empty. Once we sat, we didn't get a menu for another 10 minutes, and couldn't order for an additional 20 minutes. That's 40 minutes BEFORE ordering. The food came 30 minutes after that. It's BBQ! It should have been smoked hours ago...an order of BBQ does not require more than 5 minutes to put on the plate and possibly heat a little bit. This was ridiculous. So....70 minutes in, the food arrived. We ate, and then it took them another 30 minutes post-meal to bring us our bill. This is just unacceptable, particularly on a Saturday night. I am the most lenient person when it comes to service, but this was outta line. Now, I know, they just opened. Our server said as much several times (nice guy too). But still, the pure time and negligence was so bad, they shouldn't have opened under those conditions. Lastly, the decor here was not thought-out at all. The interior looks like it supposed to be a bit up-scale, much more than your typical BBQ joint. Clean lines and walls, limited decoration. But...it was just bad. The colors were a mute grey-blue, very bleak. The lighting was white fluorescent. All bad...a BBQ place should be down-home and inviting, with warm feelings and colors, like wood and cowhide and lanterns or something. Or maybe a checkered tablecloth. Whatever. As a down-home place, it failed. As an up-scale place, they would have to hire an interior decorator. The wall-sized windows also don't work...you only want windows like that if you have something to look at. All you see here is a Kragen Auto Parts and the ghettoness of the Mission/Bernal heights stretch. Not an inviting vista. So to sum it up, average food (except the ribs), unacceptable service, and terrible ?atmosphere/decor. Not worth it. Again, a bay area BBQ failure.

I went to have lunch here yesterday with a friend and had wonderful service. ?They restaurant was almost at capacity, however the service was attentive and quick. ?I think they worked out and are still improving the restaurant-start-up kinks that most restaurants experience. ? We had the ribs and brisket with a side order of collard greens and mac&cheese. ?All was excellent.... ?I would definitely return.

I was a little nervous after reading the lukewarm reviews...but I tried Baby Blues for lunch today anyway. My collard greens were steaming hot and flavorful. I loved the bite of potato salad I stole from my friend...not too mayonaise-y and with a bite of mustard. And my pulled pork was awesome. Wait staff was friendly and service was just right. I don't crave BBQ ?on a regular basis...I'm not from the South...but I thought Baby Blues was awfully tasty and I left with some for later.

I was hesitant to try BBQ in SF because I regularly eat it when I visit my brother in Kansas City. It was a great tasting meal, but the sauces still don't compare to KC. I got the pulled pork plate with Okra, and Blues on the Cob. The corn was delicious with the cheese powder, but I have had it served this way at a few other restaurants around town. The pork was perfectly tender and wonderful. The highlight was, surprisingly, the okra. It was cooked to perfection, with stewed tomatoes, and a touch of garlic. My date was scared of okra, but I talked him into trying it, and he ended up eating most of it. The corn bread was crumbly with bits of corn, different than many other places, but tasted more natural. No sweet butter or honey to go with it if that's your thing. We tried all the sauces. The tangy tabasco was my favorite. The sauce that was supposed to be very hot, wasn't to my palate, and it tasted a little bland. Then there was a sauce that was a little sweeter, also a little bland. I mixed the tabasco and the hot sauce, and that was my favorite combo for the pork. When my brother comes to visit me from KC, I won't take him here.

Me and my buddy were in the mission ready to check out some hoops, it is march madness you know and we were both hungry, so it was between bbq or phat philly. He said he wasn't too impressed with phat philly so we decided to walk a bit further and it was worth it big time. I had the hound dog which is a lunch special. It had beef brisket which was perfectly cooked and a third rack memphis ribs which was fall off the bone so good, you get to pick a side and I chose sweet potato mash which went perfect with the meat. They also bring corn bread not my fav but okay to sop up some meat juices. ?They have a nice selection of beers on tap $5 each, I think it should be $4 each but anyway I found a great bbq spot.

It's not BBQ! I am from the South and was looking forward to some place in my part of town finally doing proper BBQ. I was also happy to see they deliver. We went on a Friday night and were told the wait would be an hour. I thought that was quite strange - as I have been in literally hundreds of BBQ joints all over the country and never had to wait. Stand in line, maybe, but not actually wait. I mean, the meat is already cooked, right? It's not as if the waitperson has to send an order to the kitchen to cook. The only BBQ places I've been to that had wait people maybe had them to refill your iced tea or - on rare occasions - to take your order and bring it to the table. But the whole point of BBQ is that it starts smoking early in the morning and is all ready when the place opens - so waiting an hour was quite confusing. Oh well, we had movie tickets, so we left and thought we would try it again soon. So Sunday we were having friends over and we thought we would try the delivery. The food arrived and they had forgotten a few items. No biggie - new places always have kinks to work out. We called them and the super nice staff was very apologetic and promptly re-delivered the missing items. We had ordered the Baby Backs, brisket, and pulled pork with sides of beans, cole slaw, and mac and cheese. I was a bit leery because the meat didn't *smell* like BBQ. There was no spicy and smoky aroma. Yet I held out hope - thinking all that really mattered was the taste. This is where the trouble is - there is no taste. The meat is obviously cooked in an oven - not smoked. Thus it is NOT BBQ under any reasonable definition. What a bummer. I thought with their "down-home" branding and image they would at least raise to the lowest common BBQ denominator of selling smoked meat. I know we're in San Francisco and most people here have never had real BBQ - but still! Yes, I was previously suspicious when I've passed by and saw no woodpile, no smokers, no smoke - nothing to indicate it was a BBQ joint - but I assumed they must smoke off-site somewhere and bring the meat in. WRONG. They cook it in ovens and finish the ribs on a gas grill. Since it's not BBQ, not in cooking method or flavor - it's a bit pointless to review the meat. I will say the brisket by-the-pound was shredded - which as a BBQ aficionado - I've never had except in a sandwich. The pulled pork was lean and really flavorless. I mean, you do need some fat and you need it to be partly rendered out by slow smoking. That is just what BBQ is by definition. The ribs were OK - but I can make better oven-cooked ribs at home, if that's what I'm looking for. The sides were very lackluster - the beans were a bland mixture of black beans, pinto beans, and a few others without the smoky-sweet-spicy taste of traditional BBQ beans. The mac and cheese just tasted of torn noodles and fat - not much cheese flavor and the advertised blue cheese was nowhere to be seen (or tasted.) The slaw was edible. The BBQ sauce was quite sweet and just lacked any soul or personality (which, I guess, is a perfect match to the meat.) They have a very hip space, a really nice staff, and very reasonable prices for The City - but I just can't overlook the glaring fact that they're not selling BBQ. Thus the single star. One would think they might have visited Memphis, or Texas, or North Carolina to get a basic idea of what BBQ is before opening the place. Or at least stop in Lilly's on Divisadero (in my opinion still the best BBQ in San Francisco - though not top-notch.) Even Memphis Minnie's, which is sort of nuevo, lame, overpriced BBQ is much, much, much better. Unless they start smoking meat, I give them 6 months. Maybe I'm wrong and the hipster vibe, location, and basic lack of BBQ knowledge in San Francisco will somehow pull them through - but I doubt it.

!!!!!!! Yes yes yes yes yes! This place keeps getting better and better. I was here with my friends post B2B. ? Friend #1 ordered the beef brisket with a side of mac and cheese and potato salad. Friend #2 ordered some variet of rib with a side of pork and beans and okra. I ordered the Sidecar and a side order of the smoked hot link. My sides were the mashed potatoes, the mac and cheese, the pork and beans, and the chicken smoked rice. The mashed potatoes were delicious but could have used a sauce or gravy on top. The mac and cheese = always delicious! The pork and beans were pretty much the baked beans with a GENEROUS heaping pile of pulled pork on top. ?This was soooo good! The chicken smoked rice was damn tasty, especially when forked up with the pork and beans. However, dammit, the smoked hot link was my favorite. ?It was sweet and spicy! ?I loved it. We were waiting maybe 4-5 minutes, and the head chef guy sent over a plate of the grilled shrimp with some hot sauce and the catfish sauce and some limes. THE SHRIMP IS SO GOOD! It was juicy and tasted delicious. ?I am definitely going to order the half catfish and shrimp platter next time I come here. The head chef sent out the food because he said we would have to wait a little bit longer for our food, but then it came out directly after the shrimp! And as usual, the staff here rocks. ?Our waitress lady was very friendly and attentive. ?Whoever hired these people did a fabulous job. I shall return!

My flatmate's boyfriend came over on a friday night with a delivery menu for Baby Blues BBQ. I'm not much of a bbq fan so I let my Southern flatmate decide what we were ordering. She ordered the Blue Devil (four meats and three sides) and some cornbread. The delivery arrived at the expected time. Food was hot and smelling good.

Disclaimer: I'm Southern and so is my family for many, many generations. In fact, we're pretty country. Most of them don't even have a computer to read this review. Moving on. So, six years ago when I moved here, it didn't take long to figure out that Southern food in restaurants here is NEVER going to be like back home. You have to go in and just experience whatever they're offering, and you enjoy it or you don't. The only place I get seriously legit Southern food in the Bay Area is at mine or my Southern diaspora friend's places. They have four sauces. One tasted like it had cardamom in it, and I actually thought it was pretty good. Sweeter than I usually like, but really good. There's a Tabasco Ginger sauce, pickled hot peppers in vinegar (which I love), and a few others. ?Good rub on the baby back ribs, Memphis ribs were good, as were the beef ribs. Lots of pepper in the rub and the sauces were nice and tangy, not bland like the other spots I've been here. Salt, people. Salt. This isn't Memphis, people. This is San Francisco. In the Bay, for my money, this is a good place. Service was fine. I don't know what all these whiny prima donnas are complaining about. My bet is that they're the same people on here who go to a diner and complain about how its greasy. IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SOUTHERN BBQ: A wait isn't a huge deal. The point is to socialize and hang out with your close family and friends and shoot the b.s., food isn't the only thing. Go with more interesting people next time. Minus one star cause I really just didn't dig the collards (tomatoes, etc?) or cornbread. Potato salad could've used more salt, but I bet that was just whoever happened to be the prep cook that day. No big deal. I survived just fine. I could see people docking more stars for collards and cornbread fails, but I thought this place was pretty tasty. Not completely traditional, tasty. ?They deserve more business, and those who go in positive, won't be disappointed. Basically: It seemed like a place where the chefs may or may not have had traditional BBQ, but maybe they have and this is their take on it. It's still scrumptious BBQ. Quit 'cher whinin', ya babies. If you're so picky, why did you go to a rib place that has grilled corn with cotija and lime on the menu? Four stars for the meats and mac and cheese. Didn't try the cole slaw. Dang.

Baby Blues is tasty, but as the other reviewers ?note, this is not true BBQ. ?There is no smoker -- ergo, it's not BBQ. ?I've been to the SF location twice, and also went to the West Hollywood restaurant a few months back. ?I've had the brisket, the pulled pork, the Memphis-style ribs and most of the side dishes (the mac n cheese, fried okra and creamed spinach are all solid). ?The brisket and pulled pork are braised in Guinness, so it's tender, moist and has some depth -- but it has none of the smoky flavor that you would expect from BBQ. ?I'm not sure how they do their ribs, but I imagine it's some sort of grill/oven combination. ?Again, not BBQ. ?It's not worth a special trip, but if you happen to be in Bernal Heights and want some grub in a mellow environment with decent service, Baby Blues will serve you well.

Their meat is nothing to write home about, I'm afraid... tends to be a little dry and over-cooked... but, and this is their redeeming quality, their sides? ?A-Mazing. ?The collareds and the creamed spinach are my two favorites, and their cornbread is moist and delicious. ?

Confession: I haven't actually eaten here (yet). But I will, believe me. Meanwhile, we had lunch at work catered by this place, and it was fantastic. So I can say at least that the food is great, very flavorful BBQ, and the mac-n-cheese is maybe the best ever. I will be heading to this place soon, to be followed by a visit to the Attic for happy hour. If the in-person experience is as good as the catered food, I will be upping my rating to 5 stars.

DAMN - that's good eatin. Even at the pre-opening, with only a limited menu, this place is kickin. The ribs were cooked to perfection and scrumptiously seasoned. A plate of 4 different sides - all of which were licked clean. I couldn't get enough of the extra corny cornbread and the dessert sampler was divine. Typically, I find California BBQ joints to be mediocre at best and often just terrible. Either everything is way too salty or sauced to death or both, improperly cooked and uninteresting. This place honestly has it going on. I can't wait to go back.

This is a review written by someone who has been in the restaurant business for over 30 years, so please, bear with me here. Opening a new business is incredibly difficult, especially a restaurant. I know, I've helped open more than 8, including the Slanted Door, twice (Brannan and Ferry Building). It used to be that when a restaurant opened, they would have MONTHS before word got around about the new kid on the block, literally months. They'd have time to work out the kinks; service, ordering systems, how much food to order, etc... By the time word began to spread, they'd have had time to get their sh*t together and would be ready for their "hope full" success. Those days are long gone, thanks to the web, food blogs, yelp, eater-sf and the like. Folks are at your door minutes after you open, not months. The grace period to work out your kinks is GONE. And the whiny children and their whiny reviews on Yelp are all the proof you need that it's true. An additional problem with all these supposed-pundits and their ilk, is that now the mainstream press; Chronicle, SF Gate, Guardian, etc, now feel pressured to review new openings much sooner than the previous 3 month wait they used to observe. The upshot? Great new places that earn well deserved praise for their food can get crushed by the instant popularity and experience their growing pains in the space of days rather than months. My advice, ignore the spoiled children who didn't get their food immediately. Yes, the ones not mature enough to look around and see that the place was overwhelmed and that maybe they should give the place a break and come back some other time? I'd bet anything that they're never opened anything more than a menu, let alone a real business. I'd love to know what they have contributed to their neighborhoods, besides childish bile... P.S. The food is rockin! Welcome to the hood gang.

The search for good BBQ in the Bay Area continues. ?I've been craving ribs and hit this place up with a few friends recently. ?We all agreed to order something different so we could share. ? I got the ribs, which were ok, overall. ?They appear to be made with a dry rub and I'm a sauce girl. ?The sauce options were good--sweet and tangy to hot. My friend ordered the Texas rib, which was cooked perfectly and was absolutely delicious. The memphis style ribs were just ok, as we found them to be a bit tough. I am always excited for the sides in a BBQ joint. ?Too bad this place really let me down. ?The mac and cheese was mushy, as the pasta was waaaayyy overcooked. ?It was also quite bland. The blues on the cob was 'blah' and I'm not sure the cob was cooked enough, as it was very hard to bite into. ?But, the creamed spinach was absolutely delicious. Good beer selection and cool ambiance. ?Service was friendly and attentive, overall.

I learned of this restaurant from the Examiner newspaper and let me tell you, the Examiner hit the nail on the head! This restaurant is delicious and a MUST re-visit. We went in on a busy Friday night. I ordered pulled pork with mashed sweet potatoes and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was TO DIE FOR! Absolutely delicious! The sweet potato mash was tasty but i guess im just not really a fan of sweet potato mash. The pulled pork was amazing and juicy without any added BBQ sauce. My bf got the brisket which was surprising but good nevertheless. We were expecting sliced beef and got what looked like pulled pork, just beef. The restaurant brags about their XXL sauce which i found to be awful tasting. The regular BBQ sauce is much better. Also, the service was less than perfect! We were fine with a wait because we showed up at prime dinner time on a Friday night, however im not that cool with being quoted a time, and exceeding that time by a long shot. She told us 20 mins and said we can wander around the neighborhood and have her call us when our table is ready. Since it was only 20 mins, we decided to wait in the restraurant. Fast forward 45 minutes and we had barely gotten seated. Don't feel bad for us though; a large party of 9 was quoted 45 mins and ended up waiting over 2 hours! Also, our server was inpolite and never came to our table. The food was great. Unfortunately the service made me not want to visit tis restaurant again. Luckily for us though, they deliver!

imagine my excitement to hear Baby Blues was opening here in SF. ?I took clients to the Venice location and fell madly in love. ?Everything is great, the baby backs, the brisket, the crack & cheese! ?Having lived in Memphis for a year, I know good BBQ and there ain't none in SF until now. ?They even had a blue grass band playing there on sunday. ?The owner is hands on and the service is spot on. ?They had some big orders ahead of us for Super Bowl and came over several times to let us know it was coming. ?How often does a new restaurant get the staff thing right? ?Baby Blues - I've only got eyes for you!

Let me start by saying I really want this place to succeed and will try them a few more times before giving up but my first experience last night left a lot to be desired. ? I waited a few weeks after opening to try this neighborhood restaurant for a couple reasons. ?One is I like to give a new place some time to work out the opening bugs. ?The other is signage - or lack thereof. ?The restaurant has no exterior signage with the name of the place so I had no idea how to call in a take out order. ?My friend Kurt and his boyfriends wound up going this past Tuesday and he brought me a menu yesterday so I knew I would call in an order on my way home. My concern continued when I called in a pretty simple order (one whole chicken and three sides) and was told it would be 20 minutes. ?OK - I can handle that even though I'd be passing by on my way from 24th St BART to home in about 10 minutes. ?So I get there and no one greets me. ?There is no signage regarding take out. ?I get the attention of the bartender and say I'm early for a take out order and she goes to check but doesn't come back and tell me anything. ?The place is LOUD. ?Hard surfaces everywhere, a cheap , tinny sound system blaring music and the visual assault of a large screen tuned to ESPN. ?I continue to stand by the bar but am not offered a drink - which I would have gladly bought to dull the noise and ease the wait. ? I want to get someone's attention to ask if they can run my card so that when my order is up I can go but the staff is pretty much running in circles. ?This became more frustrating as eventually I could see what I was certain was my order bagged and ready. ?The person behind the bar approaches me with my check (and not a bag) and I give her my card and she takes it while running to answer the phone. ?She stays on the phone a few minutes and returns with my card. ?I sign and she runs for the phone again. ?I'm waiting and she eventually gets another waiter near her to bring me the bag. ?I ask if there is any sauce in it (it's a BBQ joint!) and she says no and goes to get some of each of the two available. ?I'm pleasant as I say thanks - now 35 minutes after placing my order - 25 of them observing the chaos under unpleasant conditions. Anyway - they're new, I'm hopeful and hungry and only a couple blocks from home. ?I get home and open the bag. ?The sides are already a disappointment in size: three 1/2 pint containers: mashed potatoes (delicious) baked beans (OK but not baked enough - too saucy) and collard greens (pretty good but oddly saucy too). ?I plate a little of each then open the chicken package. ?Smells good and looks like a lot but wait something's wrong. ?I mentioned I ordered a whole chicken and expected to see just that - perhaps cut in 1/4s but would have been fine whole. ?Instead there are four 1/4s. ?Now none of my friends would confuse me for a breast man and that goes for my taste in chicken too. ?But the four 1/4s I was looking at were all breast/wing 1/4s. ?Four of 'em. ?I was looking forward to a leg/thigh which, to me, tastes better and also stays moister through a long smoking and would have left the expected two breasts for my roommate later or myself if super tasty. ? So, already disappointed on a lot of levels I cut up a breast/wing and no way this spent a long time in a smoker. ?Roadside, for example, smokes their chickens 4 hours (and their pulled pork and brisket for 17!) ?so that it's falling off the bone but this was actually difficult to separate the wing. ?Don't get me wrong - ?I am not saying it was undercooked - it was fully cooked - but not slow smoked by a long shot. Last straw - I spent $30 on one chicken and three sides an no corn muffins? ?"They come with all the meals and this is the same as two meals and there should have been at least a couple in there. ?I'm pretty sure I didn't see them in the sides section or I would have even bought them. Like I said, I *really* want to like this place and for it to succeed. ?It's joined a neighborhood of very good restaurants who all do a large amount of take out so they will need to streamline that operation: signage, promptness, something to do while waiting - like selling me a drink - would all be good starters. I'd like to see them publish their smoke times, temperatures and woods used - BBQ eaters care about these things. ?And BBQ eaters who do their own smoking (like me in a Kamado) *really *care. ? I'll try more of their sides too - but think the portions should be full pints when a la carte at that price: they are as GFC up the street and at Petes @ 20th. ? I'm very happy to see catfish and shrimp on the menu which don't require long smoking for flavor/tenderness but am leery of the ribs and brisket if they are anything like the chicken. ?And finally, when someone orders a whole chicken - give them one - preferably from one bird but at list try and replicate the parts from one. ? I promise to be back soon - hope it gets better.

congratulations! your food kept you with a descent star rating. Because your service sucked. In the two times ive been there i have not been treated as friendly as i would have liked. maybe they didn't like the color of my skin. i hope not because it is in the Mission district. Anyways the person who i assume was the owner sat us down but i had to get our menus because the lady, whom i assume was the owners wife forgot about us. Then the white couple next to us got served first. ?maybe it was an over site. i hate to think that stuff exists. anyways so we finally got our order in and the beef brisket sandwich was one of the best ive had. my wife also loved her bbq chicken. the sides are bomb also. so as good as the food was i guess i will be returning for more. maybe with friendlier service next time. well just have to see!

Interactions with owners of restaurants usually always win me over. ?Paul, the owner of the restaurant and the man behind the BBQ (didn't catch his name) made a point to come over and greet our party of 7 after we dined. ?It was a very genuine greeting and he said that he felt satisfied seeing us all having a good time. The atmosphere at Baby Blues BBQ was great--lots of thought went into planning the decor...down to the little blue candle holders (typically red at most places). ? My friend and I shared the "Blue Devil"--4 types of meats and 3 sides: -Brisket: Tender but not as melt-in-your-mouth as other places I've had. -Baby back ribs: It really is tough to compare to my Mom's baby back ribs--these were average. -Beef rib: A little charred for my liking--found this more fatty than I'm used to. ?But it was huge! -Tiger prawns: ?These were the highlight of the platter--shrimp were firm and large--really tasty and seasoned just right. -Mac and Cheese: Nothing too amazing--probably because I was ?comparing it to the mac n cheese I had the other night that a co-worker made for a holiday party. -Sauteed okra: ?This was surprisingly good! ?I'm usually not a fan of okra in gumbo so didn't really know what to expect having it on it's own. ?I would order this one again. :-) -Beans: ?A little too many other ingredients mixed in with this. ?Just straight beans are how I like it. -Cornbread: Hmm...a little too moist and almost pasty rather than bread-like. -Sweet tea: Perfectly sweet but also still able to taste the tea. Overall a good experience. ?I expect a tad more out of the food next time. ?They definitely know how to have a good party though--the live music was a nice touch.

I hail from the Eastern New Mexico / West Texas area. ?I was just walking down the street, minding my own business when a waft of smoked beef kicked me into a nostalgic frenzy. ?It was very easy to make a decision on what to eat that night. ?I am very, very picky about my potato salad (one of my few family traditions) but the potato salad here quickly won my affection. ?The house-concocted sauces also earn an A+. ?Portions here are also very southern-sized, so couples with sane appetites should only order one plate of food to share.

I'm from Memphis. So, if I give a California joint anything over 2 stars...I'd say it's pretty good. Their "Memphis-style" ribs are not Memphis style in seasoning, but they are good. There is a clove/cinnamon factor and not enough smoke to be Memphis style. They are also finished with a sweet molasses wet sauce which would NEVER happen in Memphis. However, I won't give them a strike for flavor. They may "hide" a bit behind sauce, but the sauces are good and the collard greens, while too large in size to actually eat without a huge mess, are very authentic in flavor and I enjoyed them a great deal. The cornbread is very rich and tasty - again...not southern style at all (we don't do sweet cornbread), but almost like a sweet dessert addition to the plate. I didn't try the pulled pork or any other meats like their brisket, but my ribs were flavorful and good. I say, ignore the descriptions and the references to parts of the country where the styles of each meat's treatment originate because they're mostly wrong. Just go to eat a nice piece of barbecue and you'll be happy. Specials, desserts that looked appetizing and many beers on tap round out the 3-star review.

After a spirited afternoon hanging at MANGO at El Rio, my group of six hungry dykes descended upon Blues in a cacophonous ravenous wave. We were greated by a cute freckled waitress & a massive fold out menu. Dishes with names like "Gator Bait," "Lasker Burger," and "Blue Devil" baited our already watering mouths. As the one vegetarian in the group, I protested momentarily until I spied their "Side Car," any 4 side dishes served w/an order of corn bread. Side options included: Baked beans, sauteed okra, creamed spinach, collard greens and stewed tomatoes. I was sold. We ordered, drank our beers and waited expectantly. It was around this time we got into a very loud conversation about all the men we've "known" (in the biblical sense) and all the large sets of balls that came with them! So many dykes, so many stories of men with large ball sacks!! When the food arrived, we continued with the tales of "ball games," and the woman at the table next to us giggled while delicately gnawing on her baby back ribs, "You guys are having just the BEST dinner conversation!" Blame it on the beer, the hunger or the bbq, but it was totally worth it and we are SO going back after the next Mango!

Good ribs (they could be more tender and juicier), and great cornbread (corny and buttery). Wonderful fresh lemonade (it's the real thing...) and yummy banana pudding. The food here is comforting, and the the sassy molassy barbeque sauce rocks my socks. Also, try the shrimp po'boy. Great atmosphere, relaxed dining, and solid food. Try the fantastic macaroni and cheese, creamed spinach, and definitely the cornbread. Pulled pork is REALLY great, as are both the pork and beef ribs.

When it comes to BBQ I think everyone has high expectations, because why open a BBQ joint if you won't do it right. So with that said, I start with 0 stars and they get earned from there. Service: though it took the server a few minutes to come over to us, he promptly took our beer orders, got them too us quick and answered many questions about the menu. and got us more beers fast. worth a star. Entrees: We had tiger prawns, memphis ribs, baby back ribs and beef brisket. The prawns were great, worth a star alone. the brisket was shredded, very moist. good taste, I can give it a star. And then there is the ribs. Both were very dry and burnt! and neither was anything near fall off the bone. I'm sorry, but you don't open a BBQ place where the ribs don't fall off the bone. Minus 3 stars, 2 for the ribs sucking and 1 for the lack of effort. Brings them back to 0 stars total. Sides: we had the mac and cheese, okra, collards greens, corn bread and pork and beans. the mac and cheese was ok, nothing to write home about. the beans weren't thick enough to be baked beans, but the inclusion of pulled pork was a good touch. the okra was ok, and the collard greens were quite tasty. the corn bread had the texture of corn bread, but lacked the corn somehow. I give them 1 star for the sides. So for 1 star, I got the worst ribs i've ever had at a BBQ joint, good prawns, decent brisket and passable sides. and it all cost way too much, over $20 per platter. Honestly, they need to take a trip to Kansas City, Texas, Memphis and the Carolinas and try all over again.

To the yelper who complained about the pulled pork Being bland; if you had listened to yer waiter and tried It with the applecider vinegar, you would have been in Bliss. And the guy who complained about precooked ribs; What do you call "managing it via pre-baking"? A Bad joke? Anywhos The lasker burger is one of the power items on the Menu, as are the jack sandwiches, and the sauteed Okra. Not slimy like I remember it.

After a lousy BBQ experience a few weeks ago, we were looking for someplace in the Mission to have a solid, comfort-food outing with Wife and Daughter. 'Twas fairly early on a Friday evening, and the place wasn't exactly hopping - the service was just Goldilocks - not too much, not too little. Drinks showed up quickly, beer was cold, good selection (including the ubiquitous PBR, along with actual good beer), and the menu looked good. Wife and I ordered a couple of combos - the Texas, Memphis, and Baby Back ribs, and Daughter got the pulled pork plate. The ribs were pretty good, the best among them being the Texas beef rib, with a huge amount of perfectly-barbecued meat on one huge rib. The baby-backs were falling off the bone, but still moist, with a good spice on them. The Memphis pork ribs were tasty, but a tad dry for my taste. The sides were great - the best baked beans I've had in a long time, with a mix of different beans, and good, spicy flavor; _awesome_ mashed sweet potatoes; solid, tangy greens; and mouthwatering mac and cheese. It's not the best barbecue I've had, but it's definitely decent.

I super duper love this place. We had a long flight on Sunday that included a too-short layover in the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. While we were wheeling our bags over to the next gate at a full clip we passed a BBQ place with a line of Army cadets out the door and round the corner. There was no time to stop but the BBQ craving was planted. As soon as we landed in SFO I called in an order to Baby Blues. God it's delicious. I love my corn-on-the-cob grilled with blue cheese on top. Mac-n-Cheese - so rich and good. The Beef Brisket was just as good as I remembered it. Craving satisfied!

The sweet potatos, collard greens and spinach were great, and it was fun to drink Kool-Aid (the waitress called it "red flavor"). The ribs were good, and the beef brisket was juicier than much I've had in the city, with good flavor. The staff were friendly to boot. I am definitely coming back.

I've eaten here many times an the food is great. But I just got pickup. They messed up my order and misse some of the pulled porkm out. ?This meant there waant enough food for the 3 of us. The owner refused to help. He would only offer credit for the missing meat not the full meal. He would not credit the full meal He would not deliver the food UPDATE The owner called back later an offered a free meal. The food is awesome. So upping my rating.

Ok so let me start this off by saying my co-worker ate here last Friday night and had a dreadful experience. I for some reason thought it was a one time thing and decided to give them a chance anyway based on the fact that much is forgiven if the food is bombtastic. We waited for over 45 mins for a table last night....every 20 mins it was another 20 mins..it was busy and I get that sometimes you have to wait for good food. The staff at this place is stellar hence the two stars...however that is their only saving grace!! Once we were seated our server was nice and informed us that they were out of both sweet tea and unsweetened tea.....while reviewing the menu he was also very helpful in answering our questions about what was good and what was not. My husband and I shared a mixed meat plate I believe it was the Baby Blues Plate...we got SHredded Beef...Pork Ribs (Memphis) and Chicken....our friends ordered a mixed plate as well with Catfish...Ribs..Chicken...Shrimp...so needless to say we had all of the meats covered at our table....we also got the Okras...Creamed Spinach...Mac and Cheese and Collard Greens. It took them almost an hour to bring our order over to us...not once did they check in to say that it would be right up or to bring the sodas that we ordered to replace the very awful tasting "blue kool aid" (I mean who messes up Kool Aid but that is another story). It would have been helpful to at least have some cornbread to eat since we were starving!! It was also at this point that I realized our wait had been this long based on the fact that the kitchen took a looooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggg time to get the food prepared and to the tables. The food came just as we were about to eat our arms off...The meat was luke warm and over cooked. The chicken was dry and did not taste good at all in fact all I could taste was charred over-cooked meat. I even got dark meat...dry dark meat just ain't right...in fact it is down right NASTY. The Catfish had a gassy after taste no doubt from the gas grill being used. The ribs were ok nothing to write home about ?but I can do better ribs in my oven and the shrimp was decent....although it was a little over cooked but I can forgive that. I asked the server why it took such a long time to get our food to the table and he said..."they just opened and they are still trying to figure things out" We also wanted to try the banana pudding but they were out... our server did say "at least we did not run out of ribs this time" We ended up ordering cold pecan pie which was not bad and cold peach betty/cobbler... Cobbler should be warm with vanilla ice cream...I think they offer these two dishes cold so that they can be made ahead and get to your table before the night turns into day!! The peach betty was ok but they used canned peaches which for me is unforgiveable..... Having eaten BBQ in North Carolina....Kansas City and Georgia this ain't cutting it for me!! The meat lacked so much in so many ways.... I was not impressed with the wait time...the food or for that matter the decor. If the food was good I could get over having to wait for it...with so many yummy dining options in the mission I would for sure pass this one up. If their meats are slow cooked for 18 hours then the flavor and taste should be tasted all the way to the bones...there was little to no flavor in anything that I ate last night. I really wanted to like this place because I love me some BBQ but once again San Francisco has proved itself to be a foodie paradise in many ways but not when it comes to BBQ. ?I may visit their LA restaurant to see how it compares but something tells me it may not be any better. To sum up my experience please see below... Ribs: Sorry Out... Catfish:Running Low.... Chicken:Only White Meat.... Iced-Tea:Sorry Out of Tea.... Banana Pudding:Just ran out... Water: Oh we have plenty: Customers: Not for much longer if you do not get it together!!

Amazing food, even better service (the nicest, most knowledgeable service I've had in ?LONG time)... A few of my faves: bbq chicken, okra, creamed spinach, mac & cheese, XXX sauce, kahlua cake, key lime pie. Though everything I tried was tasty!

The worse barbecue I've ever had in my life and definitely in San Francisco. ?1. Beef brisket should be sliced against the grain like roast beef not shredded up like a pulled pork. 2. Both the pulled pork and brisket tasted as if it were boiled, as it was very watery and bland. ?I did not taste the ?smokey flavor that is present in barbecued meats.3. overpriced 4. ?The ciabatta bread is the wrong choice of bread to serve considering that the meat was watery. ?Terrible, terrible, terrible! ?How dare they call this barbecue!

I finally went inside!!! Aren't we excited? Yes? Okay, let's move on then, shall we? I also, if you hadn't already noticed, added another star. The Man Candy and I took a cousin, and my almost 4 year old son, in for lunch a couple of weeks ago. I had already tasted the tastiness, so knew what I would be ordering. My son had already eaten and was expected to play quietly, which he actually did(pen in your purse ladies, there's aaaalways a napkin just waiting to be doodled on) Man Candy told cousin he should try the Jack Sandwich(Smoked Link and much, much more) which he did, and loved. Man Candy himself chose the Shrimp Po Boy.He says it "was okay" ?and that "the Jack Sandwich is better"... I got my usual Brisket Platter with Mac & ?Rice.Yes, TWO starches! It was yummy and actually quite a bit of food for one person.The restaurant was cute, it was a slow Monday early afternoon so it wasn't too busy.We got friendly and pretty quick service. I'm thinking.....yeah!

Service: 2/5 Food: 2.5/5 Wait: 2.5/5 Price: $$ Presentation of food: 3/5 Presentation of restaurant: 3/5 Overall: 2.5/5 So, I had came here with the boyfriend when they had first opened; around the first week. We came in, stood for a minute to wait to be seated since we weren't sure if we we're suppose to seat ourselves or what not. The waiter dude there told us we can sit any where, I forgot exactly what we ordered, but I know I ordered their Mac&Cheese side with Pulled Pork; the Mac&Cheese was kind of dry and not flavorful what so ever. So I wanted to season with a bit of salt & pepper, so we asked and not only did they "NOT ALLOW SEASONING" the waiter wasn't very friendly either. He was more like "OH, THE CHEF DON'T ALLOW ANY EXTRA SEASONING LIKE SALT AND PEPPER ON THE SIDE; ITS MADE THE WAY ITS MADE AS IS". So that was a downfall to the restaurant, since the food wasn't flavorful enough and when we ask for some seasoning (because it wasn't placed on the table already) they denied us. I had never experience anything like this before, I won't ever be coming back here nor will I suggest to anyone I know either.

Maybe 3 and and a quarter stars like star search out this piece - nice service, super easy seating on a Saturday @ 7:30. Sweet tea just right, beef links good, impressive collard greens (for the west coast which has so far pretty well failed in the greens arena). ?Most sauces & Cole slaw were spicier (as opposed to flavorful) than they had to be, and the mashed sweet potatoes weren't as candy-ish as I'm used to, but I really enjoyed it. A couple friends who had the chicken said it was good but not really anything to write home about. ?meanwhile, my other friend CRUSHED it, so yknow, you'll hafta see

One of the worst (non) dining experiences ever! A friend was taking me out for my birthday and she chose Baby Blues BBQ. I was excited because I wanted BBQ. When we stepped in the door, it didn't smell like BBQ, not good for a BBQ place, but I looked at someone else's plate and the food looked okay. We had to find our own way to our seats and finally a waitress came over, handed us our menus. She started talking about how Baby Blues was a family restaurant and asking us how we heard about it. She had a more "Why are you here?" tone than actually talking to us like people. We looked at the menu and things were cool. Then, I kid you not, we waited 20 minutes for a transvestite waitress to come over and attempt to take our order, which h/she didn't even do a good job of. We had waited literally 20 minutes and no one so much as acknowledged our presence (expect glancing over at our table periodically and still not helping us) until this waitress came over, with no water in hand I might add! The place was not even busy. We got up and left and no one even apologized, although they knew how long we'd been waiting. Skip this wanna be location and head to Memphis Minnie's on Haight, a real BBQ joint, which has amazing food and even more amazingly welcoming people and service.

Mediocre BBQ, but more importantly they have a very poor live music policy. I have seen some great musicians playing there and people were very appreciative. Unfortunately, the management, which pays very modestly for these groups, feel that they can cancel a performance at the last minute. Stand up for live music and support businesses that appreciate and respect professional musicians.

When I heard that A BBQ joint was opening right down the hill from my house, No one could have been happier than me. Then I found out it was the sister store of A barbecue joint I had recently seen on the Food Net work down in L.A. So to say I was excited was an understatement. I live for BBQ! I barbecue at my house ever chance I get, I own 1 grill & A big ass smoker. So I can't tell you how disappointed I was after eating there. I even gave it more opportunities than most would. I went not twice, not three but 4 TIMES!! Some would say I'm foolish spending money on food that wasn't good, I'm just trying to illustrate how much I wanted it to be good. I've tried, the chicken, the shrimp & the ribs, Oh the ribs. The sides were adequate(nothing that blew my socks off)but if the meats sucks, what's the point. Ribs for me are paramount & each time they were burnt. The 3rd time I was there I actually left ribs on my plate! Which I NEVER do & my momma would slap me if she knew I wasted food! Sorry for what I'm about to say I truly believe this may be part of the problem. Let me preface by saying I love my Latino brothers, but they DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE BBQ!!! They did not grow up smelling it, eating it & especially cooking it. That's not A racist comment it's A fact. I truly believe that BBQ is kind of A culture & w/o growing up w/it, how are you to know what it's supposed to taste like & cook it properly? I had A temporary glimmer of hope when one night I passed by & their was A "Brutha" behind the grill & he looked to be training the guys on the grill. So it was then I decided to give them the 4th try. Nothing but A big fat let down. Why not go on Craig's list in Memphis or KC advertise for A pittmaster, fly him out for A couple of months & train the staff properly? As for the sauce, what the hell is that supposed to be? It does not smell or even begin to remind me of BBQ. I never advocate the use of store bought BBQ sauces but, most anything on the shelf at Safeway is better than that stuff they put on their tables. As for the people that gave the 5 stars, I'd venture to guess they have never been to the South or Kansas City & especially Memphis. There's no way you could say that it's good if you had real BBQ. There is absolutely NO comparison, none what so ever! The bay area is so starved for good Que,we really don't know what good Que is. So when someone cooks some meat over A grill we here in the Bay think "Its Awesome!" Example; If you think Big Nate's is good...get on A plane to Memphis, quick. I was in Georgia not too long ago & believe me even the "Chain-iest" BBQ restaurant is 10xs better than ANYTHING in the city. What really blows is that I have to pass by this place almost everyday & I'll always wanna go in, then I'll have to stop & remind myself, Naaaw don't do it I'm So bummed. P.S. The reviewer that said there was no BBQ smell. In the restaurants defense, these days bay area air quality management(the same idiots that brought us "spare the air" days/nights)Require new restaurants to install smoke arrestors & to cook w/wood pellets. Yuk! So there will be NO smoke here or any other BBQ restaurants from now on.

I LOOOOOVE BBQ. I have eaten it in Cleveland, Memphis, Texas and points north& south. Baby Blues was extremely disappointing. the sauce was weak, the ribs tepid, the beans cold the atmosphere horrid.

This is a great solid BBQ restaurant, with great service and a great vibe. ?The sides, ribs, and pulled pork are fantastic. ?I've arrived there before with 14 people and they were able to accommodate us at their fantastic high table in the front window. ?Those same 14 people split one of their smaller group feasts which ended up being a great value and even more food than we could eat. But most importantly, a great story about their service: ?a couple weeks ago I ordered some delivery which ended up being a bit late, as I learned, because the delivery guy's car broke down. ?So instead, the guy who showed up with the order turned out to be the OWNER who hired a taxi to make deliveries. ?He personally apologized for being so late (which wasn't really necessary) and handed over the grub free of charge (definitely not necessary). That sort of service and classy behavior deserves to be reported on Yelp. ?Done.

Food is decent. ?Service and delivery is atrocious.

I love it when something new comes to the neighborhood. So I stopped by to get some BBQ to go. I went with the lunch special, The Cherokee Spike, which comes with Pulled Pork, Beef Brisket, Smoked Link, Cornbread, soda (got the Sweet Tea for a dollar more) and a fixin (I went for the Mac and Cheese). All this for about $14. Price-wise, that's not too bad. This is good BBQ overall. The Beef Brisket is what I like the most- cooked just right with plenty of flavor. The Pulled Pork was good, but not as tasty as I thought it would be. Everything else is good too, but nothing has "wowed" me yet. So that's when you bring in their extra spicy sauce for some sweet, tangy kick in your throat! The lunch special is like a sample of what Baby Blues has to offer. I'm looking forward to my next visit which will be in house.

I ain't no rib expert but as a fatty I was impressed with the ribs at this place. ?They were on the dry side but if you squirt extra BBQ sauce it was awesome. ?I usually hate spare ribs but the memphis ribs here were delicious. ?The baby backs were also good but not as good as Houstons danish baby backs. ?But $25 for a 1/2 rack of baby and memphis plus 2 sides and cornbread is pretty reasonable. ?The next time I come back I am going to go for the Texas beef boner. ?It was huge. ?I wanted to grab the bone and spank the manatee with it.

This place smokes and bbqs their meat. They are serious. The sauces are homemade and plentiful . I love the bbq chicken sandwich. We went with a group of 20 and had the combo for 14 people and ate till we were stuffed with an alcoholic drink it was only $20 a piece including tip. Its a ridiculously good place for family style eating, and you get to try everything that way. I have been vegan for my whole life and this is the place i chose to eat my first meat. i was not disappointed! For sides i liked the okra, stewed tomatoes, and baked beans...yummers! They are all vegan ...they also do a vegan combo plate named after the charming owner's sister...watch out for the tippy metal chairs at the big group table in the front...warning.

The 3.5 average for this place seems just right. I ate food that someone else picked up from here, so I have no comments about the ambiance, etc. We had memphis ribs and baby back ribs, both of which were the highlights of the meal. They were not as tender as they could have been and were on the dry-ish side but were really tasty and everyone liked them. The cornbread was good - maybe overly sweet for some but I liked it. I was sort of surprised at how many things weren't bad but weren't great either - the bbq chicken was fine but nothing special. I would eat it again but wouldn't pick it out. The pulled pork was cooked well, I thought, but really lacked in flavor. I poured bbq sauce over it and then it was good (also, I liked the bbq sauce but others thought it was too sweet) - but again, I would order something else next time. We got sides of the baked beans and smoked chicken rice. The beans were fine - there was a nice variety of types of beans, although I didn't find them very flavorful. The rice may have been the biggest disappointment. It was fine as rice but almost as innocuous as white rice. So, I wouldn't recommend that. Overall, I think this is a 4 star place if you feel like going out for some tasty meat, but probably more like 3 stars if you're looking for real bbq. So, I would eat here again sometime, but it definitely isn't the answer to my quest for BBQ in the Bay Area, which I think will take a turn towards the East Bay, as it probably should have long ago. PS - Also, if you do get take out, make sure to double check the contents of your order. We had to ask for that bbq sauce, and, tragically, did not receive the piece of pecan pie we had ordered. PPS - We learned that they do not deliver to the Sunset.

mainly excited about the praised mac n' cheese and cornbread, i had such high expectations for this place. to my astonishment, it all sucked pretty badly. i think we got an old batch of mac n' cheese and the cheese was all seperated and lumpy. the cornbread had an odd saltiness to it which was far from enjoyable for me. they ran out of the blues on the cob, so EFF that. the brisket was far from anything amazing. it was quite ordinary and seemed to just be a pulled beef. and i believe there was only one or two servers who were slow and ours forgot to bring my friend her sweet tea. i most definitely will not be back.

Burp! Lick Lick all clean! I have the BBQ chicken sandwich in my tummy with the mac and cheese. The chicken was moist and very flavorful. I like the bbq sauce, it's not too vinegary, or too sweet, it's just right! The hot sauce was a bit too hot for me. I got it to go and I think they gave me the XXX hot sauce. The mac and cheese, I didn't finish. I'm too full but I did taste it. It's better than I've had at other BBQ joints but it's not the BEST, just good. I will go back to try the ribs next time.

i said i'd give this place a second chance since the bf has heard great raves about the food, and he had not tried BB BBQ. ?we came here on a saturday night, and had no problem getting a seat. ?we shared the blue devil (4 meats and 3 fixings), and opted for shrimp, catfish, brisket and beef ribs. ?the shrimp was a show stopper, so good we ordered 4 additional pieces. ?it's grilled to perfection drizzled with a delicious light sauce. ?the brisket and ribs were both tender and flavorful, but the catfish was rotten. ?i'm not sure if it had perished, or if it was the way they grilled it, but either way it was minging. ?we tossed the fish to the side, to say the least. ?had it not been for the fish, i'd rate the place ?4 stars. ?for our sides we had the okra and mac n' cheese which were both great, as was the coleslaw. i thought i would not give this place another shot due to my previous take-away experience, but i'm glad that i did. ?i definitely had a different and pleasant experience dining in house.

Finger licking goood! ?That pretty much describes the ribs, brisket, chicken, and pulled pork at this joint. ?I've been here several times for some real BBQ and have yet to be disappointed. ?The ribs are juicy, flavorful, and come off the bone easily, while the brisket is very tasty and tender. ?If you prefer white meat, opt for the moist chicken and delicious pulled pork. ?For a kick, select from 4 satisfying sauces that will leave your taste buds jumping for joy (or screaming for water if you can't handle the XXX). ?The sides are also good and have a very homemade appeal to them, especially the mac 'n cheese. ?Wash everything down with unlimited ice tea and Kool Aid! ?This spot is great for large parties and even has group menus. ?You won't get the blues at Baby Blues!

I had the Guinness Braised Brisket Platter and holy cow was it delicious! ?They have an assortment of sauces on the table, and as yummy as those are, you just don't need them! ?The cornbread was more than delicious and the corn on the cob with cheese and lime was a welcome surprise! ?I would definitely eat here again and I'll take as many newbies with me as I can!

ah yeah! we did family style so i was fortunate enough to try the brisket, the beef ribs, and the chicken. all super good and the blues on the cob was really an awesome twist. but i don't know if you can actually mess up or can you master sweet potatoes at all because they never stop bringing the yum-but let's just say that they were perfect in a way that i just can't put my finger on. our server was great and the service was timely. and how is the neighborhood sketchy? you are just off of precita and bordering on bernal heights? it's much safer than the rest of the mission, and we all know that the inner mission has been singing the blues lately. sorry maybe they just need to put one in the marina to spare some people the trauma of having to experience a diverse and unique neighborhood. sheesh!

BBQ is like religion: people get a lot of enjoyment and reassurance out of it, and people get pretty (freaking) heated about it, too. ?Not long ago I was in Texas and got all kinds of conflicting advice about where to go for barbeque, with explicit opinions that reminded me of, well, asking people what denomination was the best. ?Lots of dreamy looks when talking about their favorite, and lots of fiery indignation when talking about the other (whoever the other may be). I'm sure that if Baby Blues was in Texas there'd be some polarization about the place, possibly at the same level there is from what I'm seeing in the reviews here. ?Though personally, I really don't see what's not to like about this place. ?Attentive, knowledgeable service: as shown by our waitress who checked in regularly and came over to tell us about the several cheeses in the mac & cheese. ?A good location: as evidenced by being able to park within a block of the place, right on the street, no problem. ?A nice space: good light, a good view of the street, comfortable chairs, and all that. ?A good beer and (short, but adequate) wine list. ? And right, the food. ?We had brisket, pulled pork, a link, baby back ribs, slaw, potato salad, mac & cheese, and corn bread. ?The brisket was properly cooked and prepared, as was the pork. ?The link was surprisingly spicy (though easy to handle) and good, too. ?The ribs were just right as well, bone-gnawingly delicious. ?The buttermilk style slaw was exactly the way I prefer it - more savory than sweet, crunchy, fresh, generously portioned. ?The flavors of the potato salad were spot on, and while I thought the potato bits were a bit larger than they should have been, the lack of uniformity bespoke a home-madedness that overcomes that kind of quibble. ?The corn bread is in the traditional, savory style as well - I like the cake-style better, but I can recognize that for folks who like cornbread in this way it was very nicely done. ?The mac & cheese was, well, divine. ?The different cheeses complimented each other very nicely, adding a great depth to the side that my date and I loved. ? I'm not from a major BBQ producing region of the country so I don't have much of a vested interest in the style one way or the other. ?Memphis, Texas, Carolina; pig, beef, chicken; cheesy mac, cole slaw, potato salad: whatever's there, I'll eat and if it's good I'll like it. ?So I don't have a problem with the fusion aspect of barbeque here. ?And the portions are generous enough that my date and I split a Blue Devil and had leftovers for the next day. So three meals from one ($30) entree, which I think puts a good spin on their price points, which I though were reasonable. ?We will be back and we will be bringing friends and we will be telling others. ?They're doing God's work here, and as long as you're not some overwrought vegetarian, or some other such misguided unrealistic affected vainglorious pissant, you will see the light.

This place gets an extra star because the owner rocks! ?He had noticed we were waiting for a bit, made sure he personally took our order and checked up on us frequently! ?He even gave us a piece of pie that a patron brought in to share with his restaraunt, which was also very good. ?Besides the great service, the food was good too, I'm glad we only ordered the meat by the pound because the meals would have been way too much!

We chose Baby Blues to cater our wedding in Novato after trying several different BBQ places in the Bay Area. Paul was great to work with: he just exudes positive energy and had such enthusiasm for our event. The food is delicious - so many guests have just raved to us about how memorable our BBQ picnic lunch was. Just to mention a few specifics, the potato salad is amazing (we ran out!), I love how the baked beans have a kick to them that make it almost like a chili (great for our vegetarian guests), the ciabatta buns for the sandwiches are one of those little things that are easy to overlook, but they are so tasty and stand up to BBQ meat (soaked through buns and weddings do not mix!). We've stopped by since and we love the laid-back feel of the restaurant. I love that we can relive a part of our wedding so easily!

Went here tonight for a CCSF playoffs win with my BF :)..... we usually go to Memphis Minis but I wanted something new. The place was cute on the inside and we got seated right away. However, we were not impressed with the food. I ordered the Texas Beef Rib with Chicken Smoked Rice and Mac n Cheese and my bf ordered the Pork Ribs and Shrimp with the same sides....sooooooooooooo lets start. The beef rib was huge and quite tasty but the sides were very very bad :( . The mac n cheese had a strange cheese after taste and the rice was very dry and not flavorful. Moreover, the corn bread was definitely reheated and luke warm boooo. the pork ribs were ok but needed more spices to them and the shrimp was grilled great and was flavorful. I also must add that they DO NOT HAVE FRIES, which made my man very sad and disappointed lol....it was ok, but i wouldn't come back. sorry.

Walked in the joint with a Groupon in hand. We ordered a 3-meat combo: babyback ribs, pulled pork, and chicken. Sweet tea was a must-have when having BBQ, so we ordered one each. It took a while for the food to be served. Obviously the joint was not very busy given they had to heat things up before serving. In a real good BBQ joint, meats are served right out from the smoker. But not here. Best of the combo was babyback ribs. It was fall-off-the-bone good. The chicken was moist. However, pulled pork was a let down, felt it was soaked in the sauce for way too long. Sweet tea had some weird taste in it, something tangy, not the ones we were used to. Compared to other BBQ joints I've tried in the Bay area, Baby Blues was the better one. But still not good enough for a midwestern transplant like me. I might go back if I am in the area, but it won't be the one that I'll drive 20 miles to fix my cravings. Perhaps this is as good as BBQ gets in SF? I hope not, but my search continues until I find one that's as good as Spring Creek BBQ of Dallas or Pappy's of St Louis...

I definitely love my BBQ, and I feel like Baby Blues has some OK BBQ. I came here with my friends and we had the BBQ chicken, Beef brisket, and BBQ shrimp. They all tasted pretty good, but the portion size was unforgivable! We asked them if the three-item combo would be able to feed three people, and when they said yes, we expected it to feed all three of us! What we ended up getting was 5 pieces of shrimp, the leg quarter of a chicken, and maybe a handful of brisket. The sides were pretty good as well, especially the mac n cheese, but they were sides, and definitely not enough to make up for the lack of meat. I left feeling unsatisfied--I've had better BBQ and paid less money for it. Plus parking is horrible, so I have no reason to come back.

i thought the food was deelish - particularly the sauteed okra and creamed spinach. the bbq was pretty tasty and i liked the sauces, though the "XXX OMG FIREFIREFIRE YOURE GONNA DIE" sauce that the server tried to scare us with really isn't that spicy. but who knows? i was hella hungry before i got there and to be honest, i was (and still am) completely sold by the fact that they serve kool-aid with unlimited refills. AND they had my favorite flavor: *RED*! omg. fucking amazing. RED!!!

I'd been wanting to try this joint since it opened up a couple months ago - SF only seems to have a few BBQ spots so having one open in my 'hood seemed like a Christmas miracle. ?We tried the pulled pork plate and the baby back ribs......Both were great (big portions).... Lotsa different sauces to try as well. ?The platters come with 2 sides/each so we shared mac n' cheese, mashed sweet potatoes, creamed spinach and beans....All of them were great! ?The cornbread was ok (different from the fluffy mix most of us bake at home). ? I'd definitely go back and try more options (they have lots)... Not cheap but seemed less $$$ than Big Nates.

Not quite worth the wait but if I'm not starving, I'd go here again. ?The meat dishes were pretty good, the coleslaw was awesome. ?However, the okra was pretty yuck as were the pork and beans. ?The BBQ sauces weren't quite right either. ?My boyfriend hated the cornbread but I liked it. ?It was a little on the heavy side and not as sugary sweet as most cornbread is nowadays. ?Yeah, the neighborhood isn't great for parking but I'm not sure why a bunch of posters think the neighborhood is sketchy. ?Maybe they should keep to N.

First let me say I'll continue eating here because I like the food and the location. ?That said, I didn't appreciate eating cold chicken in a restaurant. ?Yes I said cold. ?I ordered the smoked chicken, which I have enjoyed before, and the breast was charred on the outside, but literally cold on the inside when I cut into it. ?No one once asked me how my food was so I didn't say anything. ?Besides I don't send food back; just my philosophy after working in the restaurant field for a few years. ?Instead I ate the delicious sides and the thigh/leg section which was not cold. ?The breast came home with me and made a nice sandwich later. ?So overall quality can be spotty and service is minimalist to put it kindly. ?Hopefully they see this review and make sure not to serve people old food they forgot to reheat. ?A few more mistake free meals and I'll upgrade my rating.

Good maybe even great bbq, at least for SF. Pros: very tender pulled pork, good traditional sides like okra (a bit mushy, but okra is tough to do right), and good collards. They get it - you can add your own sauces which lets you regulate the regionality and strength of your own BBQ favorings. Great to have in the area! Conclusion: if you want some twang on you tongue, it sure beats Nate's and the also rans like that place on Divisidero - hands down.

it was so good my friend and i went back the next day just to make sure it wasn't a result of being drunk from a few beers at el rio. the pulled pork sandwich - YUM! slathered it with the bbq sauce and then added the unlabeled sauce. delicious. even put the sauce on my potato salad. mac-n-cheese ain't too bad either. service is a little slow and not too personable (depending on server), but the reasonable prices make up for that.

Thought I try this place again and brought my hubbie. He ordered pull pork plate w/ cole slaw and baked beans. I ordered the brisket w/ collards and mac n cheese. We both thought the sides were better than the bbq meat itself. Brisket was dry and the pork was kinda bland. Service and decor was good, but other than that it was a mediocre dinner. Memphis Minnie's and Gorilla BBQ are a lot better.

i recently had a not so great experience with their texas beef ribs. ?this was the 1st of over 10 times going that i have had a negative experience so i will consider it an anomaly and not deduct any stars. decent service and great bbq food. ?i usually get the texas style beef rib with cornbread and the corn on the cob with mexican cheese/lime. ?when you see this rib you think to yourself yabba dabba doooooo!!!! ?this is one big arse flintstone rib, but it is extremely tender and flavorful. ?i usually have the mild sauce so that i can still have feeling in my lips afterward and the molasses mixed together for dipping. ?i go in without eating dinner the night before, a small but light breakfast then no food for the next 3 days after the meal. ?even though i am full, i cannot bring myself to stop. the other stuff in this place is great too, the jumbo prawns, other ribs et al. i think i even had some dessert here once, banana pudding possibly? ?it was great, but seriously... i was way too full to enjoy it.

Not the best BBQ ever, but it's a nice place to hang out in the neighborhood. They have a few good draft beers, and the place is pretty spacious. The lunch special's where it's at, served everyday from 12p-4p. It would be a great place to have a party with a group of 8-12 people, if it weren't so damn expensive for the party platters. If the food were better I'd understand the pricing. It's good, but not spectacular.

My ribs were quite good, but the real highlight wasn't the meat; it was the sauces and the sides. ?There were four available sauces; all good and all quite differently styled. ?I'm sure there's something there for everyone (me, I would be very happy with three of them and perfectly OK with the fourth were it the only one there.) ?The sides were also great. ?Not huge portions (and not cheap), but the baked beans were smoky and perfectly cooked, and collards were equally good.

I went to Baby Blues on 12/26 for my birthday dinner with about 20 people and we were all stuffed and happy when we left!!! ?We called the owner Paul earlier in the day to say we had closer to 20 people than the original 12-14 that we'd mentioned to him, and his ready response was "Bring it on!" ?I liked this place already. They had our tables ready when we arrived, and they started us off by passing around BBQ shrimp. ?Deeelicious (and I don't even eat shrimp -- it just looked too good to pass up!). ?Paul told my fiance that if we were ok with it, he'd give us a set price per person (very reasonable) and just keep bringing out different dishes and sides. ?That was an excellent suggestion considering the size of our group, and it worked out perfectly. ?Out came the BBQ chicken, ribs, catfish, hot links...along with mashed sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes, greens, mac & cheese, and cornbread (to die for!). ?Paul and his daughter (who was our server) did a fantastic job of keeping us eating and drinking and everyone loved the food! ?Let's just say its no small feat to do that with a big table of 20 people. ?After dinner, the plates of dessert came out with pecan pie, key lime pie, kahlua cake etc...the kahlua cake was divine. ? Paul was terrific throughout the entire meal -- always making sure "the birthday girl" had a beer or glass of wine, bringing out extra desserts and making sure we'd all had enough, etc. ?As we were getting ready to leave, my friend accidentally knocked a bottle of wine I'd been given as a gift from the bench to the floor, shattering it. ?Paul cleaned it up and made a little joke about it, and as an incredibly sweet gesture, he brought over a bottle of his best Syrah to replace it as a gift. ?I was floored! ?He and his staff really went out of the way to make us happy, and his friendliness and his kitchen's amazing cooking helped to make my birthday very special. ? It's hard to satisfy a group of 20 hungry people, and Baby Blues definitely delivered! ?We'll be going back again and again. ?This place is not to be missed!!!

Admittedly, they had a bit of a rocky start here, but I'm surprised to see some who have had such a hard time getting in - probably I was lucky the four times that I have been here now: - ?I was here on a smokey opening night - Another time when the hood wasn't yet fixed and sides and pulled pork/braised beef brisket were only on the menu - The last two times the full menu was in play - and it was excellent! I recommend either style of pork ribs (memphis or baby back ), the beans, creamed spinach, collard greens, mashed potatoes, and the cornbread is amazing. Time before last, we had 8 people and ordered the "Teaser Feed Bag" which feeds "6-8 people" -- we had more than enough food and ended up packing a lot back. It was $110 and could have easily fed 10 of us. They also have a nice Malbec available and some good beers (Stella, Blue Moon, Fat Tire, and some others). ?Ah, and the grilled shrimps were very tasty, too! The vibe of the place is a really great local gathering spot where lots of folks know each other and the owner (from walking dogs on Bernal Hill and Holly Park and just around the Bernal 'hood). Last night, we sat near the door and all the tables and bar spots were filled while friendly people milled about having a drink and chatting while waiting for a table. Good vibe. Through all the initial hiccups, the owner (Paul) and his staff have been friendly, giving, and apologetic about the issues. They absolutely have nothing to apologize for as far as the food goes - it's great.

Not being a big red meat eater, bbq places can be tough. But this one serves up options for everybody. They were out of chicken for the night, so I ordered the shrimp po'boy, which was by far the most delicious shrimp po'boy i've ever had, with huge grilled shrimp and coleslaw on the sandwich. Mac n' cheese was pretty delicious, creamed spinach good, but baked beans and mashed potatoes were average. Nice, clean and hip atmosphere, and very friendly service.

I got the lunch special - Beef Brisket sandwich that came with coleslaw ( got it on the side) also got a side of collard greens. It was delicious the meet was super good just melted in my mouth coleslaw was good and I liked the greens. Good portions I was full the rest of the day.

Last night my good friend Graham from the U.K. wanted to go out to eat. His Friend Susan suggested we go to Bably Blues BBQ in the mission. I love BBQ so I was willing to try it. Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of Everett and Jones BBQ in Jack London Square because of their Briskett and their Spicy BBQ Sauce. We were seated quickly, the place was full, loved the fact that the bar serves plenty of pulled beers especially Guiness! I opted for iced tea; they offer regular (not flavored thank god) and sweet tea; unlimited refilss too! The menu is amazing, lots to choose from, the prices started from $13.95 up to $31.95. Everything comes with 2 sides or "fixins" and corn bread. I chose "The Three Kings" because I wanted to try their ribs, it has Briskett and I like chicken. My "fixins" were Mac n Cheese and mashed sweet potatoes. What was presented to me by our ever so friendly waitress was a mound of food that looked delicious. Before I continue, I was asked if I like white or dark chicken meat. I'm a thigh and wing fan but was told I could only have thigh/leg and breast/wing; Now why is that? The ribs were big, moist, the meat came right off the bone. There are three sauces to choose from which were mild, medium, and spicy/hot all with a vinegar base and added a nice touch to the Briskett. The Briskett was more of a pulled pork and not the nice slices with a crispy topping I'm used to at E and J's. It tasted great but I just wouldn't call it Briskett. ?The Chicken was moist, had a nice grilled taste and I had that wrapped up in a to go box for lunch today. The sides were tasty, served hot. The Mac and Cheese was my favorite side, it's one of those dishes that takes me back to my childhood and this did just that, I should have ordered a double side of this. The sweet mashed sweet potatoes were good too, can't complain about them but wished I would have ordered mashed potatoe since I'm a fan. The cornbread was unique, not sure what they do to it but it was brown instead of yellow ?but had a "Stick to your ribs" quality that I liked and was moist and not crumbly. I used it to sop up the Sweet Potatoes and bbq Sauce. I'd definitely come back to this place.

I ordered the baby back ribs with the mac n cheese and the blues on the cob. ?The baby back ribs were good, but nothing to die for. ?The mac n cheese was very tasty but a bit to heavy for me. ?It seem like they melted a brick of cheese onto the macaroni. ?The corn was bomb. ?It was laced with chipotle butter with blue cheese.

It's not everyday I give 5 stars but this one of those days. Let's just say, they hands down got the best BBQ in the entire bay area. Been there 4 times and each time was great, very consistent and the best thing is their BBQ isn't drowning in BBQ sauce. The staff is real friendly and the portions are always a surprise. I ordered the beef rib out curiosity and was given a giant piece of dinosaur trex meat, it was so big that I felt like a caveman. The sweet tea was great, but the hipsters that hijacked this isn't, they gotta stop serving PBR to keep those people away. Anyway, if you got 30 bucks and you're starving, then head over to baby blues, very very good stuff.

And i don't really understand why since he is half salvadoran and half irish. the closest thing he comes to the south is his eating habits. i blame him for my failure to diet. My excuse: I am dancing my ass off in carnaval nobody wants to see a jiggly out there! (at least in my case) So after trying out the "free" samples at the Safaway nearest you, he was craving ribs. and not just any ribs, BBQ ribs. and being the sucker that i am i couldn't deny the man his ribs. what if he dies craving ribs?That's what my mother always says every time she runs to buy Pan Lido down the street only to come home and hide it from my sweet toothed father. Anyway, a friend of mine had recommended this baby blues southern bbq place and all he said was follow the DRUG sign. so i did. I followed it with my nose to be exact. you can't really smell this place like I can smell Pete's BBQ from a mile away. Literally. But let me tell you, ALL OF YOU, this place went beyond my expectations. I am a drowner. I love to drown my food in sauces and condiments and anything that makes my bread soggy. And I love to drown my pork ribs with BBQ sauce. I didn't have to here. My memphis ribs came out perfect. no need to drench my ribs with the 4 sauce bottles they place at your table. and the macarroni with the potato salad hit the spot! it's the closest to homeade southern BBQ i have ever tried (can you tell I have never dated a southern boy?). I was so stuffed I could barely walk out of the place. Good thing no one witnessed me licking my fingers non stop. The diet fairy would be so angry at me if she found out.....so shhh.

it's finals time which means delivery for dinner! ?my boyfriend and I ordered the burger, pulled pork, texas ribs, baked beans and chicken rice. holy moly. ?it was all soooo amazing. the flavor on the texas ribs is incredibly rich. ?the pulled pork is juicy and so flavorful. ?baked beans have a nice deep, spicy flavor. ?the chicken rice is awesomeee. finally the burger - wow. ?the bacon and blue cheese is cooked in the patty with some green onions and other flavors. ?it was so juicy and had a great char flavor. ? I have nothing but amazing things to say about our meal tonight!! also, it seemed pricey at first, but we're going to have leftovers for a couple days! the only reason I dock a star is bc we ate there once a few months back with a friend and it was just ok. ?the ribs we had weren't anything nearly as amazing as the texas and I didn't love the mac n cheese. ? I will definitely be ordering some more - hopefully in the near future!!

The BBQ here has a homemade feel. The baby back ribs are delicious with their molasses sauce! I highly recommend them. Their brisket wasn't so great. Considering I've even had better at famous daves and their pork beans were terrible. I would think their sides would be larger if you're sharing amongst two people, but we made due. This place ultimately was a great random find. The customer service was awesome. Our waitress was very catering :)

The owner even gave my baby girl 2 blow up balloons, a kitty and a guitar......so sweet! I will definately come back here again with my baby girl and friends....thanks for being so sweet!!!

Yes, this place is open. ?They're stil working things out (the sign in the window still says "coming soon," there isn't a "We're Open" sign on the door) but the food was damn tasty. ?Brisket and pork, mashed potatoes, beans, and an elote-style corn on the cob (minus the mayo -- they'll have to fix that). ?The cornbread is really excellent! ?They are serving some alcohol (no hard stuff). ?Definitely put some of the chili-infused vinegar AND bbq sauce on the meat. ?The owner is nice and the staff is eager to please. ?I see this place getting better and better as time goes on.

Would I tell a friend to try it out? yes. Would I say it's the best bbq in the city? no. Pulled pork did lack flavor, but there are several sauces on the table so I worked it out. Good sweet tea. The mashed sweet potatoes were way too sweet. The service is... a little strange. Trying way too hard. The inside is cute in a garage sale in Arizona type way- which I'm sure some SF snobs hate. I'll definitely be back to see how it progresses here- I want to love it! and I'm sick of half good not cheap enough places opening up in the hood. I want deliciousness!

I haven't written a Yelp review in a long time, but feel compelled to write one about Baby Blues BBQ. I went again last night. This was my fifth visit in the few months that they have been opened. Everytime I leave feeling like that was the best meal I had of my life. On weekend nights, the wait for food is long. It's well worth it. The wait staff knows you are waiting and are genuinely concerned for your experience. They kick ass given the crowds. The XXX bbq sauce is some of the best ever. The brisket,...to die for. The chicken juicy. The sides....mmm..the blues on the cob is brilliant. Last night, my girl and I both ordered full plates and two beers...bill came to just over $40 and we left with a full meal that is sitting on my desk now that I can't wait to eat. The negative reviews seem to be limited to jaded hipsters who dont appreciate good BBQ and are more concerned about being witty then honest. This place kicks ass.

Not consistent. Great the first time, horrible the second and the third was OK. First time loved the garlic, tomato side dish, the 2nd time I ordered this it was just canned Roma tomato's thrown in a bowl, no garlic, no oil no great taste. Same with portion size, large and generous once, skimpy the next. I wrote the "Contact Us" on their website twice expressing my pleasure and dismay and tho it says we'll get back to you...they never did. I love the sauces they have on the table, especially the very hot and the sweeter one. The ribs are good...or at least sometimes.

The cornbread is amazing - moist and chunks of corn yeah! Sorry that is always a test to me, hate dry cornbread. The bbribs are great, brisket, greens, mac and cheese and smashed sweet potatoes---all great too. Oh and the chicken is pretty good too.

A welcome addition to the northwest Bernal hood. ?This place is quite yummy, and while I haven't loved everything I've tried there the food quality is definitely good. My favorite so far is the shrimp po boy. ?The catfish is great too. Haven't had too much of the meat- it's best done with several people so you can all share. Their sides are delish; the macaroni and the corn on the cob (I think they call it , blues on the cob) are standouts; although the slaw, okra and greens are great too. The decor is nice, the staff is nice, the sauces are nice. Love this place. UPDATE April 2011: It's still just as good as ever!

In my oppinion I love this place. But I only order one thing on this menu: Ace in the Sleeve. I love the grilled shrimp and catfish spritz with lemon and a little bit of their sauce, it's a taste of seafood heaven. The portions of these meals are huge for what you pay for. I rarely get to finish my ribs and touch my sides because I've filled up on the other meats. I'm not usually a big rib fan, but I come back here and never get tired of it. They serve kool-aid!

Disclaimers: I've only ordered delivery from here and I would not consider myself a BBQ aficionado. ?My reason for the 2 stars is that 3/5 times I've ordered from them, they've made mistakes. Yes, I'm the fool for still ordering delivery. ?But I hadn't had for a while & was craving BBQ. My roommates' grilled shrimp were good as always but the pork ribs were just too fatty. ?Everything is too fatty & rich. The baked beans and cornbread were pretty blah. The mac n cheese is tasty but greasy. ?I may give them one more try to see how the beef ribs are since I've been told they are good.

I called in a take out order as a first time customer to Baby Blues. I ordered a simple pulled pork dish and a pulled pork sandwich. I was told 20 minutes to pickup. Twenty minutes later I arrived at the restaurant and received the worst service I ever experienced in the service industry. Needless to say, after being pretty much ignored for 30 minutes and my food not anywhere in sight, I left without ever receiving my dinner and wasting an hour of my life. I wasn't the only one disappointed. The restaurant was severely understaffed and most of the patrons looks pissed off.

i'd say more like 2.5 stars... first off, the pro's: - 4 diff BBQ sauces, ranging from sweet to spicy... nice! - decent quality napkins and wetnaps... no dingleberries on these hands! - accommodates large and small groups (gets busy for sure though...) everthing else: it's BBQ, so it's not like it's going to be gross. ?hell, you could put BBQ on a pigeon in the tenderloin and it wouldn't be half bad. the ribs didn't fall off the bone at all. ?it was more like corn-on-the-cob where you're just nawing at every little ounce. ?the okra was a bland, and a little soggy, the cornbread was forgettable. the mac and cheese was amazing like everyone says, but come on, put some tasty MEAT in my fat american belly! ?to have good BBQ you've gotta perfect the meat first. i wouldn't necessarily be opposed to coming here again, but i would definitely try out some other places first before doing so...

Stopped in late afternoon with a great friend of mine from the neighborhood. A bit pricey, but as I told him, the best ribs I've ever had. Oh, and the sides, the sides! Couldn't be more pleased with my corn bread and mac-n-cheese. Both super fresh with their own character. The corn bread was sweet and solid like a muffin, but with well, corn in it. And the mac-n-cheese had thick rigatoni noodles with a mix of strong, crumbly, white and orange cheeses. So bomb! And the ribs, they were great. Great, great. Very personal service, and an awesome selection of brews.

I absolutely love their cooking here, simply delicious! The BBQ sauce isn't the best flavor i've ever had, it could use some help, but I do appreciate the mixed BBQ & Hot Sauce combo. ?The cornbread is also not very impressive, it's dry, and the flavor just doesn't burst the way it should. now that I got those things out of the way, I still gave this place 4 stars because everything else on the menu is ON POINT! Great ribs, the meat is tender and falling off the bone. Delicious beef brisket, & pulled pork. Awesome bbq chicken. Mouth watering sides, it's hard to choose only 2! My favorites include mac'n'cheez, mashed sweet potato, collard greens, fried okra, and the very best side is the "blues on the cob!" ?(i personally could make better mashed potatoes, but that's just me being picky) ?and finally, their bbq jumbo shrimp, are literally, the best i've ever had! ? It's also a good place to catch a Giants game since they have a big flat screen and Shiner Bock on tap! it's a beer & wine only bar though... The service is.... OK. nothing too over the top. the owner can be a bit of a dick sometimes, and i've heard stories about how he treats his employees, I've seen him bitching out his daughter in the middle of the crowded dinning area which is totally inappropriate.... I could go on and on, but it's really none of my business, I just like the food. I wouldn't work their though if i had the choice, just saying' lost 1 star for this...

Baby Blues claims to be a BBQ place. ?I've only been once. ?The bbq brisket, a staple in most bbq joints, was not smoked at all. ?It was like pulled beef in a sauce. ?That would get you shot in Texas. ?And you would be acquitted. ?There's a lot of BBQ poseurs in the world. ?I don't know about the rest of the menu but go to Sneaky's or Memphis Minnie's if you're looking for smoked, brisket. ?A lot of people wouldn't know authentic bbq if it hit them in the mouth.

I shared a three combo plate with my wife and we each had a beer. ?The chicken and pulled pork was good; the baby back ribs were decent, not mind blowing. ?So food wise, it was good. ?Service was a little spotty, I think the staff needs to figure out how to deal with crowds and seating folks. ?We will return.

Pretty good. Definitely solid. Casual but cool decor. We sat at the bar and the bartender/waiter was very helpful. Ordered BBQ Memphis pork ribs dinner, 1/4 chicken, collard greens, mac and cheese, fried okra, and cornbread. Perfect amount of food for two people. BBQ chicken was very good. Super juicy and moist and plump. BBQ ribs were good but not great. Fall off the bone and dry style. The vinegar style sauce was very tasty, the hot bbq sauce was insane hot. Mac and cheese was very tasty, but i'm not sure it lived up to the hype. Okra was the best. Collard greens were very tasty too, but the okra was better. Cornbread was just right too.

Gave it one more try. Not much has changed. Service is ok. BBQ flavor and taste is non existent; the ribs and pulled pork taste like they are par boiled.

The people are nice. The idea and decor are cool. Portion size is generous. But the execution is terrible. I've been twice and I have yet to taste a side order that was better than awful, out of 5 tried. I'm not as down on the meat as some other posters --- mine wasn't criminally dry -- but all three meat items I've tried were lacking in flavor. I should also mention that the wine selection is lousy -- all corporate from the same supplier. That may not matter to many people, but I think it's indicative of the indifference toward food of the ownership. I love good BBQ and wish this place was better. But it's not. Hipsters might enjoy it for the atmosphere. But if you're a foodie, eat elsewhere.

Still looking for someone in SF to scratch my BBQ itch....but Baby Blue BBQ came close. All in all happy with the quality not so much with the quantity. I had the pulled pork sandwich, pork was very good.....way too much bread way too little pork. BBQ Sauces are good nice variety....sadly still have not found a Carolina BBQ sauce yet in SF. My wife had the Beef Brisket platter and Baby Blue BBQ delivered with both quality and nice size portions. The beef was delicious and the sweet potato mash was fabulous.....greens where just ok and the corn bread was way below par.

Someone else mentioned the mac n cheese and I have to say-- it's pretty amazing. There are a few things there you wouldn't expect to be as great as they are, like stewed tomatoes and slaw. The pulled pork is really worth your while and I definitely recommend checking out the different sauces/vinegar with it! It can be a little more than you'd expect for bbq, but the quality of the food combined with the really relaxed atmosphere and great service make it worth coming back to as often as your waistline can handle it :)

I kept hearing how great this place was so I decided to check it out. I have to admit I was not floored. I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich and my gf ordered the pulled pork sandwich. I thought BBQ sandwiches were suppose to be dripping with BBQ sauce? The sauces they did have were ok. I wish they had more flavor. The best part of the meal was the blues on the cob and the mac & cheese.

I like this place, the ribs and chicken that I've had so far were great, and not dry at all. They need spicier sauces in my opinion, their sauces need some help over all, they aren't really smokey or spicy like they should be. The sides do kind of trump the meats though, the mac and cheese ? hmmmm, the collard greens and cole slaw are all exceptional. The service is just OK, maybe not enough waiters for the amount of people that are there usually. ? I had to get up twice to find a wait staff for water.

A working class meal in a working class neighborhood. I am all for it. The Okra, ribs, and chicken were perfect. The catfish was a bit on the overdone side but the seasoning helped it out. Colorful staff with a great window view of the bustle of The Mission. Definitely a ?place to start out before conducting a mission in The Mission.

UGH!!! Their food is an insult to the art of BBQ!!! We wanted authentic BBQ, so we ordered a rack of baby back ribs, the pulled pork sandwich, greens, chicken smoked rice, cornbread, and the "pecan pie" to go. I don't know where to begin describing how disappointed I was with everything! ? The meat on both the ribs and the sandwich was not even cooked thoroughly! I mean I know its smoked and all so its supposed to be a little pink, but come on! This meat was sooo pink on the inside Rib meat is supposed to be fall-off-the-bone tender, but this meat was clingin on to the bone for dear life! We could not even finish our meal. The "chicken smoked rice" was undercooked, and TASTED EXACTLY LIKE ZATARANS BOXED RICE !!! It was waaay too salty and there was no chicken taste!! the greens were ruined with some nasty tomato sauce, and the corn bread tasted like cake. ewwww. the "pecan pie" was actually a nasty pecan bar with what tasted like WALNUTS on it. really? really? 5 dollars is a lot for some nasty pecan bar. We ended up throwing most of the food out. ?Don't give this place your money. Big Nate's is better!!!

The best barbecue I've had yet in SF, with the exception of the occasional good meal at Nate's. ?This place is much, much better than Memphis M's in the lower Haight. ?The chicken is about as meaty and moist as you can get in a bbq place. Don't order on a Monday! ?Well, we did once, and everything was overcooked and dry. ?Maybe these were leftovers from the weekend? ? Also, what's with their delivery statement on their website that they deliver to locations within a 15 minute drive? ?I work 5 minutes away, but somehow I'm out of the delivery range. ?Don't believe everything you read (including yelp reviews!!!)!

Not enough BBQ sauce and small portion sides If you don't mind to not have enough BBQ sauce, this is the place for you. ?They use quality meat. ?But that is not enough to give more than 3 starts for BBQ pit. ?$3.50 coleslaw was tiny. ?

Emmy's Spaghetti Shack is so RIP.

I walked into Baby Blues tonight, for the first time. ?Sat down at their raw tombstone counter, and a friendly waitress bounced over, put her hand on my shoulder, looked at me, talked to my face, and got me all straightened out. ? I ordered the pulled pork with baked beans, potato salad, and cornbread; draft PBR to drink. ?I'm a cornbread devotee and pretty much make my own, but I give this cornbread five stars. ?The potato salad was home-made fresh; the baked beans were excellent; I loved the pulled pork and I'll order it again. ?Good vinegar/pepper sauce in a bottle. The pecan pie I had for dessert was almost as good as my dear departed Atlanta gramma's. I felt right at home at Baby Blues. ?The counter and floor staff were cool, friendly, attentive, but not annoyingly attentive. ?I fit right in; no snooty "You may not fit our standards" attitude. ?Busy, noisy, friendly, hard-working, good music, good-vibes atmosphere. ?I sat next to people I didn't know, and we ended up friends and and exchanging emails at the counter. ?

An avid fan of Southern cooking, I was very happy to find Baby Blues BBQ. ?Some friends and I conducted a Sunday night dinner there after reading a couple of articles about its recent opening. ?All in all, the food was excellent. ?Wide selection of traditional bbq and other Southern dishes made for some tough decisions, but our group ultimately decided to go with the Memphis ribs which did not disappoint. ?What really enhanced the experience, however, was the owner 's (Daniel) table visits. ?He made it a point to come over to our group and explain the smoking process and provide some insight into the various BBQ sauce compositions, which we really enjoyed. ?This is an excellent bbq joint I will definitely be frequenting.

i went there alone for a lunch. The place looked nice. Not crowded at all. The waiters were pretty friendly. I think they have to sit some where around you in order to take your order. I noticed that the two waiters do the exact same thing with every customer. I had " the three king", 1/3 rib, pull pork ( but on the menu says beef brisket ??) and chicken leg & thigh. it comes with 2 fixies, i had mac'n cheese and stir fried ?okra for side dish. The ribs was amazing. the meat fell off the bones. I'm not a fan of pull pork and chicken though, but it was pretty good. In spite the fact that it was too much, i had a good time there. I had to ask for a doggy bag which is the coolest doggy bag i have ever seen. It's like a shopping paper bag that that you'll get from H&M. So if you crave for a big portion of meat, i would recommend it. Try bring some one with you.

This is the second time my family and I have eaten here. ?I'm familiar with the best BBQ in the country - ?Memphis, TN. ?Granted, this isn't in TN, however, this place needs to learn how to cook ribs. ? The memphis ribs are very tough and flavorless. ?The baby back ribs taste like they were bought at Safeway, boiled and then basted with sauce. ?I've made better ribs than this restaurant using the "boil and BBQ on the grill" way. ?The sides are just okay. ? The collard greens were decent, but, avoid the mashed potatoes that are hard and lack flavor. ? The restaurant is not very busy during the afternoon - that should tell you to stay away. ?The staff is cordial, the sides are just okay. ? They do not know how to make ribs. ?

Terrible. Let me say as a connoisseur of Memphis BBQ (Born and raised 23 years in Memphis) this isn't even a close substitute. ?That being said, I am not just being overly pretentious. ?Here's why: When I ordered sweet tea (which I made a big deal about because it is hard to find real sweet tea outside of the South) I got about 2 blocks down the road and took a sip. ?Not a speck of sugar could be tasted. Baby Blues, do you know what sweet tea is or just forget to add sugar? ?Either way it was not what I ordered. I opened up my sandwich when I got home and couldn't believe that the sandwich was not served on a regular white bread hamburger bun. ?It was also very small for the price. ?A sandwich that size back home goes for $4 tops. ?The first bite I took was filled with a giant sized piece of cartilage. ?Gross. ?I found 3 or so more as I ate. ?That is unacceptable and I took a picture for proof. I haven't given up hope yet that there is a decent Memphis-style BBQ joint in SF but this is definitely not the place. ?At $11.99 for a lunch, this was a terrible experience.

So I order delivery and they say 45 minutes. 50 minutes later they arrive with apologies, but just about everything else is wrong (and cold). They bring me a Diet Coke I didn't order. They charge me for a dessert they don't deliver, and tell me they were out of it and someone "should have told me" on the phone. The driver swears he will get them to refund the price of the dessert. Does not happen. No tip for you. Food is decent, but not worth being crapped on. Say goodbye to a local and regular customer; who will be sure to tell everyone how much you suck.

There's nothing better than ordering up a feast and having it delivered to your door. Baby Blues WAS a great option for nights when I didn't feel like cooking, but this week I learned that I'm no longer in their delivery area.

I was really looking forward to dee-lish BBQ after planning for weeks for an afternoon outing of food and wine with coworkers, one of which kept bragging about this place. I'm sorry but I was sorely disappointed. I had read reviews by my fellow Yelpers and my gut told me to go there with caution. My coworkers and I each ordered a glass of wine as a treat after a long arduous week at work. One coworker got an extra treat when a fly landed in her wine. We had to flag down the waiter since he was too busy playing a board game at the bar to notice us. At least he gave her a full replacement glass of wine. I ordered the "Three Kings" platter hoping a sampling of 3 types of meat - the Memphis ribs, beef brisket, and chicken - would show me how good their BBQ was and have enough to bring home to my husband. Fortunately the chicken was juicy and tasty and the beef brisket was moist but needed sauce for some flavor. My biggest disappointment was the Memphis ribs. I know Memphis BBQ uses a dry rub, but that doesn't mean the BBQ is dry too! Not only was there little to no meat on my rib bones but the meat was as dry as a bone. It was completely inedible. One of my sides, the creamed spinach, was bland. The saving grace of the meal was the mashed potatoes, which were tasty. We also ordered banana pudding to round out the meal. Another big disappointment. I don't know why they called it "pudding" since it was merely a bowl of very thick and somewhat tasteless whipped cream with a few slices of banana. I tasted no pudding whatsoever. The biggest disappointment of the meal was how much I had to shell over for a mediocre/bad meal. I'm sorry but the meal wasn't worth the $44 I paid. I think next time I have a bad week at work and my coworkers need a reward I'll suggest we go to El Rio across the street for good drinks, free oysters and for a fraction of the cost!

I like the fact that there is a new BBQ joint that is so much closer to home! I was curious so after work we came here to order for takeout. I ordered a shrimp po'boy that came with a side with cole slaw. I also ordered a "fixin" of mashed sweet potatoes. He ordered the "three kings" which consisted of beef brisket, ribs, and chicken along with two fixin's: mac n' cheese and collared greens. It came with a cornbread. As you can tell this isn't a light meal so come on an empty stomach. Okay, I'll talk about the food now. The po' boy was good--the shrimp were well cooked and had good flavor but that's all the sandwich was. No lettuce or tomatoes-just bread, sauce, and shrimp. I still ate the whole thing! The mashed sweet potatoes were my favorite!!! It wasn't too sweet and you can tell there is a hint of orange juice in it! Divine. The collared greens were in a sauce that made it too rich. I like it plain and simple. The meats were all tender but the sauce I recommend to go with it is this concoction they have: apple cider vineger and chili extract. That made it even more delicious! Oh also, they have XXX hot sauce which I loved. It wasn't hot to me but then again, I put hot sauce on everything so I'm used to it...Snaps to them for free refills on drinks (Soda, sweet tea, and freakin' Kool Aid!) What else? Oh, yes, they deliver (which is also a good thing)! I will definitely go back to try the other items on their list. The staff are friendly and helpful especially if you aren't sure what to order--they'll help you out. This place is still new and you can tell they are still trying to get into the swing of things but kudos to them for bringing some soul to Bernal Heights...

If you're in the mood for meat, this is the place to go. ?Been here three times and never had a bad experience. ?It's out in the Mission/Bernal Heights/Precita area so if you're in the area, definitely drop in for the best bbq in sf. ?The sides are good and the portions are big. ?Two dinners easily feeds three diners. ?If you have four diners, just add an a la carte item to supplement and share family style. ?If you're really hungry, order the Texas Beef Rib. ?It's truly a "steak on a stick". Sauces are on the table and range from sweet/mild to vinegar/hot. ?Friendly and helpful staff. ?Highly recommend.

i consider myself a hardcore bbq fan, so i was excited to hear that baby blues was opening in my hood. i have been to the one in venice beach several times. the brother of the venice owner opened this one in SF. i know this from my short conversation with him today. nice guy, and clearly proud of his restaurant. no association between them and i, fyi. i went in for lunch and had the "hound dog", which consists of 1/3 rack of memphis ribs and beef brisket. i'll get straight to the main attraction; ?ribs are the centerpiece of any bbq restaurant. if you don't get the ribs right, you got nothin'. they got the ribs right at baby blues. they were juicy, falling off the bone, well seared on the outside, and full of flavor. my only criticism is that they could have been more smoky. nevertheless, they are the best ribs i've had in SF, and i've tried a lot of joints. lulu's and big nate's do not cut it in my book. this is the only bbq joint that's good enough to go back to regularly. very glad to have them in SF. despite the gushing i just indulged in, i must note that the brisket was unimpressive. it's served saucy and pulled ?- that is shredded and stringy. i prefer my brisket smoked whole, and sliced. i had cole slaw and cornbread on the side. the cole slaw was decent, and the cornbread had a wonderful crust on it, but is just a tad dense for my tastes. i still enjoyed it though. if i could give baby blues 4.5 stars, i would. the ribs are outstanding, and my other criticisms are minor in comparison. if you haven't tried it, it's worth the trip.

I'm so happy to have a BBQ place in the neighborhood. ?We went there on Valentine's evening, were seated promptly (lucky us). ?We ordered ribs, but at 7pm they were out already!!! ?Bummer. ?How could you be out of ribs at 7pm??? ?They wouldn't be ready for another hour to hour and one half!!! ?The waiter told me they ran totally out of food the night before! ?After a long wait for our plates to arrive (40 minutes), we finally got to chow down. ?Good cornbread, my husband's pulled pork was better than the brisket....which is also pulled. ?The okra, if you like okra, was great. ?They are a new restaurant and probably need sometime to iron out the kinks....I'd go back knowing the above info......

Since I moved to SF from Texas 6 years ago, the search for great BBQ has been disappointing to say the least. Finding a place that has great meat, great sauce, and great sides is a challenge. I grew up in Texas eating a lot of barbecue so I pretty much know what I'm looking for. The food here is excellent. We ordered a mix of different meats and sides and we liked everything. To make things even better, Paul (the owner) and his daughter gave us excellent service and clearly Paul is knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his food. If you decide to eat here definitely ask for Paul and chat with him about how he cooks his meat....you'll learn something new I assure you. We will be eating here often! ?If I eat somewhere that has really good food a four star rating would be the norm. ?The fifth star is for Paul and his family that works the restaurant....they add something extra and I'd really like to see the succeed

Been here twice now & the service is the one thing that seems to be inconsistent. Avoid the Philly fanatic fratboy with the halting, annoying-ass cadence as your server and you probably have a good chance of getting your food or whatever requests you have before the bill arrives. Dude seemed completely out of it when I asked for a sweet tea refill, left my glass on the bar all the while walking around servicing everyone else in sight. In fact, he seemed pretty jovial with everyone else except when WE needed something. Undeterred by this smarmy prick, I still managed to enjoy the pulled pork sandwich smothered with coleslaw and a side 'fixin' of shell-shaped mac'n cheese. It finally became clear that this moron was either hopelessly forgetful or just downright avoiding us after nearly 15 minutes of waiting & STILL trying to flag his ass down for my refill. Only when we finished our meals did this guy utter ANYTHING of significance (yes, we might actually need the check, you douche). On the next visit, I arrived with a bigger group of people as Mr. Philly made his exit...perfect timing. The servers this time around were friendlier, but clumsy (one broke a few dishes in a span of a few minutes) and running into chairs while in high-heels. The Memphis style pork long rib came seasoned well, not overdone & not exactly falling-off-the-bone tender, but just tender enough. The big surprise came in the form of their collard greens. Had plenty kick to it and could possibly be a meal on its own or with a side of their perfectly made cornbread. The condiments include a zesty, tangy BBQ sauce, a less piquant and subtly sweeter version & a ketchup bottle of nearly weapons-grade tabasco sauce. Diners are flanked by mini-baskets of large tri-fold napkins and individually packed, lemon scented hand wipes.

Baby Blues goes straight to the top of the list for this genre. ?Happened to drive by today around lunch time and went "hmmm...." ?It was not a wasted stop. ?The "Razorback" lunch special was an excellent first choice for what I am sure will be many visits. ?It consisted of a generous 1/3 rack of baby back ribs with 3 sauces. ?My favorite was the spicy ?haberno and jalapeno, but I also liked the milder one flavored with mango. ?Also on the plate was the most tender pile of pulled pork I can remember, flavored with the tangy vinegar sauce they provide, the scrumptious cornbread, and a side of mac and cheese. ? Everything was first rate...a neighborhood treasure worth a trek from just about anywhere when you have the craving for the ultimate in barbeque.

Justin K. and I went here last night for our St Patty's day dinner. We were going to have Mexican food, but our spot was closed. I decided on getting the ?1/2 Memphis Long Ribs and ?1/2 Baby Back Ribs. I was quite hungry. The "Tripple-X" sauce was awesome and hot. The ribs were over cooked and when they were pulled apart it was not fall off the bone and I had to fight the meat resulting in two ribs worth of meat on one bone, leaving the neighboring bone naked and lonely. I might be picky, but I feel that if I can cook a more tender rib (which I suck at) then you shouldn't be charging 25 bucks for ribs. The mac and cheese side tasted like they were made from a box. When we walked in the restaurant, it was about half full (or half empty as the tone of this review is going). It filled up after we ordered and it took a real long time for us to get refills on our drinks. They were nice about it and admitted that they lagged and didn't charge us for a round. I appreciate the free round, but if I'm sitting right next to the bar it shouldn't have happened in the first place. The waitress was hot and flirty, but it still doesn't make up for it. I'm here for ribs, not hot chicks. Justin's beef brisket was tasty, but I'm not a brisket fan. I might go back and try the pulled pork but the ribs are off my list.

it's interesting how mixed the reviews are on this place, but thinking back on my own experience, I understand why - I feel internally conflicted. ?on the one hand, I want to love this place: * great, airy space with a casual and friendly vibe * really nice service (at least when I was there, all 3 of the servers I interacted with were above-average nice and helpful) * it's bbq - everyone loves bbq, and I americans have a gene to get instantly excited when they hear the words "new bbq joint in town" On the other hand, a couple things are holding me back * it is no doubt pricey - $40 for one meal + two beers (including tip) feels like a ton for bbq, even in SF. ? * it was good, but not amazing. ?It's all NC style, which means it's got a bit too much vinegar for my taste. ? but i think this is a matter of taste, not quality, which is why the reviews on yelp are so binary * finally, i had a bit of a weird experience with the owner. ?i happened to be standing next to him and he asked me how my meal was. ?i said "excellent" and he was pleased, I walked away. ?Then I thought for a minute and went back and said "actually, one thing, the cornbread wasn't my favorite - I like what you're trying to do but I'd prefer a more classic-style cornbread." ?His response to this was, no joke, to just ignore me - look away and kind of act like I wasn't there anymore. ?I stood there awkwardly for a minute, then started walking away, and he says, with just a slight tone in his voice, "We've only been open 2 month you know." ?Dude, you ASKED me how my meal was. ?I'm trying to be thoughtful and help you succeed! ?Next time I'll just BS you, but wouldn't you rather know what your customers really think? I can tell these guys are working hard to make this place a hit, so going to go back again sometime and check it out. ?I want to like this place

This is hands down the worst bbq I have ever had. I ordered the pulled pork and it had no seasoning at all. Even the corn bread was awful. Mac N cheese tasted like it had been cooked in a microwave with velveeta. The greens were awful Our server was very nice and tried to make it seem like it isn't southern so I must not be used to that type of bbq. No I 'm not used to the type of bbq that has no flavor at all. I am not used to cardboard flavored bbq. Last time I checked BBQ was born in the south. Memphis to be exact. This was an insult to BBQ. If you love it, you don't know BBQ. Only reedeming thing is that the servers are very nice.

I stopped on the way back home from mountain biking in Marin for a late lunch since it was "sorta" on the way. I had read that they had Carolina style pulled pork sammiches. I had been craving a proper Carolina pork BBQ sammich since leaving NC back in 2006 so I was happy to visit this place. I walked in saddled up to the bar and ordered a Guinness and a Pork BBQ sammich. The beer was served up cold and fast. I was just about two long sips into the pint before the sammich showed up. They guy behind the bar offered it up with some special vinegar oil stuff and with three bottles of different BBQ sauces. All these were variations on the vinegar-y hot sauce that I'm familiar with. I devoured the sammich bite by bite, each time squirting the sammich with a different sauce. They were all delicious. That's all I ate. The Carolina style pulled pork sammich and I must say, it's a darned good impression despite the fancy bun and coleslaw. I'll have to return to try their other BBQ offerings.

Good times here. Now, I've only been here twice and with large orders for a number of people. We decided to order as much off the menu as we could to sample everything. So, the meats are cooked very well and the Corn bread isn't too sweet. This is nice to me because it doesn't wipe away the taste of all the sides. The flavors of all the sides were a bit mild to my liking and I wasn't too impressed with the sauce. *I've spent some time in Dallas, TX* Overall, we all came to the agreement that this place is sure to be around for a while. The Servers are really sharp and very very friendly. We were greeted by a gentleman who we later learned is the owner (forgot his name). He presented himself as person who really takes pride in his product. Great service is always a big plus for me. If they keep this up during my next few visits, I'll bump'em up another star. So, if you're not in the mood for a good burrito, this place is worth a try.

I'm not a "BBQ God", but this is the best BBQ I've had in the city so far. ?They make their own sauces, the meat is always great, and they're in a super-cool part of town. ?Right across the street is El Rio, a nice hole-in-the-wall bar, and not too far away is 24th street with all its craziness. ?This place is a consistent crowd-pleaser.

We found out about Baby Blues from a flyer left on our door - while we generally throw them away, this one intrigued us because BBQ is the one thing we hadn't tried in the city - even after 7 years of living here. I'm from the south, my partner is from New Jersey, so we both went in with different expectations... That was 6 visits ago - a visit to Baby Blues has become a Saturday ritual for us. Among the marvelous treats they serve: the Memphis ribs are my favorite, but I've loved everything I've tried. The creamed spinach is AMAZING. The variety of homemade sauces at the table is terrific, but I find myself going back to their house sauce - with occasional forays to the standard molasses-based BBQ sauce. Though I don't usually have room for dessert when I eat there (substantial helpings) - I did try the banana pudding once - it was closer to a mousse than pudding and each bite was a little piece of heaven. Do yourself a favor and RUN to Baby Blues!

If you go, save your money and just order a side of mac and cheese, which is from what I can tell the only thing on the menu that's priced fairly based on what you get. ?The mashed potatoes were good the first time, tasted weird the second time. The BBQ is less than average. Not impressive. I've been twice, the ribs were a dried out and some were basically charcoal on a bone. The brisket was at least edible. Both flavorless, with a crappy bland sweet sauce. ?The sauce tastes pretty generic and very sugary, like they bought it from Safeway, added water and sugar, then over sauced the meat with it to cover up that it is burnt and bland. There is a difference between the charred flavor of food done on a grill or BBQ and just plain burnt. ?Corn bread was a little weird, with actual corn kernels in it and kind of dry on the outside and soggy on the bottom. Maybe that's a southern thing that I don't get cause I'm from the pacific NW. ?Another reviewer commented that her burger was way over done. I would have to agree. My friend ordered medium and it was definitely medium well. Also, the mashed sweet potatoes tasted good, but the texture made me gag. They didn't mash them well and there were a lot of little stringy fiber things left in. ?Maybe below average is what you get from a chain restaurant (or is it a franchise?), who's other restaurant is in So Cal and not from Memphis.?! Basically, there isn't much that's positive about the food. I'm not a BBQ expert, and I don't think you need to be to know that this place is below average. I could go as high as 2 stars, but the prices seemed out of sync with the quality (below average).

We live in Bernal Heights & try to go out to neighborhood places as much as possible. ?We had heard good things about this restaurant, glad to see the vacant space filled, happy when there was finally time to try it out. ?Big mistake. ?There was nothing in this place remotely inviting. ?For only being open a few months, the place already looked run down & neglected. The floors were filthy; everything looked haphazard. The bartender was eating behind the counter; the guy in the food line was eating while preparing food (gross); another guy in the food line kept taking off his cap & smoothing down his hair - he did not wash his hands after doing this, nor did he put on gloves for food prep. The waitress' jeans were so low her behind was showing; the pants looked like they would fall off any moment. ?She kept pulling them up, taking orders, bringing food to the table - not very sanitary. We ordered a platter of ribs & chicken. ?The ribs were so dry it looked like there was no meat on the bones. The mac & cheese had big chunks of cream cheese in it - very strange. Cornbread was burnt. ?The chicken & sweet potatoes were ok. ?We didn't even stay for dessert. The lack of professionalism was unbelievable. The place was such a turn-off. ?In all honesty, I would not recommend this place to anyone. ?Usually I give a place 3 tries but in this case once was enough.

2.5 stars. Corner "drugs" bbq place in Bernal Heights. We tried the pulled pork, baby back ribs, beef brisket, mac n cheese, sweet potato, and corn bread. The pulled pork was super tender and juicy but i thought it lacked smokiness like Guerrilla and the ribs were smoky but dry and tough. The mac n cheese was heated too much since it curdled. The sweet potatoes had good flavor but a bit stringy. It was like my tongue had a condom and there wasnt any flavor...hardly touched my food :/. Next time we hope sneakys doesnt sell out!

I went again last night with my friend who wanted to try it. He had pulled pork with collards & potato salad for sides. I had brisket with baked beans and mac & cheese. I think that the meat isn't actually smoked - if so, the tell-tale flavor has miraculously gone MIA. So what does that leave? A tasteless mess that only a good BBQ sauce to some extent might remedy. Alas, no good BBQ sauces are to be found here. The pulled pork and the brisket look the same - pulled - and that sure isn't right in my book. I tasted both the pork & the beef with the same reaction...ugh. The collards were a bit strange but tolerable, the potato salad was good, the baked beans can be skipped and the mac & cheese is good - not the best ever...just good. If I'm ever forced to go back, I'll have only sides and leave the pulled pork & brisket eating to everyone else since it's disappointing...disgusting, even. I haven't tried the ribs...perhaps they're better...

Jan and I are barbeque lovers and like to try new barbeque places. So, we checked on yelp what other barbeque joints we haven't been to yet and saw this place. We decided to check it out. Man, does parking suck around this area but fortunately we were able to find parking close to the restaurant. We walk inside and we like the ambience. We get seated right away and look over the menu. They have a lunch special that goes on everyday from 12-4 so we decide to order from the lunch menu. I get the pulled pork sandwich w/cornbread and soda while Jan ordered the "Cherokee Spike" platter that consists of pulled pork, brisket, link, cornbread and drink. While we wait for our food, we decided to try their barbeque sauces that they place on every table. We thought they weren't bad, but not hella good so we ended up using all 3 sauces together on our food. I thought my food was ok good while Jan enjoyed his food a tad more than me. This place is all right.

The ribs were mediocre, the okra was not cooked properly, the Mac and cheese was just not right. The hot link was "mysterious meat," as far as I am concerned. I won't even go there about the sweet tea. But MCd's does a better sweet tea. Bb-bbq tea tasted like tap water with sugar in it... I could make that at home myself. People in San Francisco, don't know what real BBQ is. The service was so so. They were not accommodating about "requests" to alter the food either. I wouldn't go back to this place if you paid me. I have yet to find a real BBQ place in the SF/Bay Area. Go to the south!

Forget that the place is tiny and dingy looking...the food was horrible. I ordered the ribs, mashed potatoes, corn bread and mac and cheese. The ribs were not juicy, corn bread was stiff, mashed potatoes did not taste fresh and let's just say Kraft makes better mac n cheese.

The neon BBQ over the door was the only thing barbeque about this place. ?The ribs, chicken and spinach had a smokey taste because they were burnt beyond repair. ?This was after waiting about two hours for the food to make it to our table! ?It seems like the kitchen was too busy preparing the take-out orders to notice that the dining room patrons had no food on their tables....the cooks need to look over the food counter once in awhile to check on their guests! ?The pulled pork sandwich meat was very bland and needed more than the xxx sauce from the bottles on the table to get any flavor...geez Gordon Biersch makes a better pulled pork sandwich. ?The sides were nothing to speak of...plain cole slaw, soggy chicken flavored rice, and corn on the cob doused with imitation cheese. ? The only thing good to say were the nice cute waitresses who kept apologizing for the poor service from the kitchen...I really felt sorry for my waitress who was on the verge of tears and felt helpless...she wanted us to have a better dining experience. ?Maybe they can blame it on being Friday the thirteenth...unlike Jason, I won't be coming back again to stab the meats...sorry for singing the blues...I am driving to Everett and Jones in Jack London Sq. for some bbq.

This is my first experience with the "dry rub" style of BBQ-ing (I'm not even sure I'm using the right term). Simply put, the meat is not slathered in sauce. Unfortunately, I'm accustomed to lot of sauce on my BBQ meats, so I was underwhelmed by my gigantic "Texas" beef rib, and baby back ribs. I also ordered the catfish which was too dry. Don't get me wrong the "Texas" beef rib was very tender and tasty, but I wanted some sauce! Born and raised in California, I'm not an expert on BBQ, so take my review with a grain of salt.

I remember Flints in it's glory and like the hot sauce at Nate's. I think this place trumps both of them. I had the links sandwich and my friend had the pulled pork. Both were huge and delicious. I also was impressed by the friendliness of the staff. I read some of these other reviews and, except for the delivery complaints, can't imagine why they wouldn't have sent their food back or questioned the staff. They were great. Give them another chance. I plan to do so regularly.

I've eaten here many times and have done "take away" a few times. ?I really like this place...and so have the numerous people who have gone with me. ?I haven't seen a reference to their hamburger - which is exceptional! ?There are a few weak sides but generally all is good. ?The pork & beans are unbelievable 'cuz they put pulled pork into the beans. ?I'm not a fan of their blackened catfish and some of my pescetarian friends have complained...but HECK it *is* a barbecue joint. ?I recommend Baby Blue highly!

This is by far, the best BBQ place in San Francisco. ?We ordered the lunch platters which included pulled pork, beef brisket, ribs and hot links. ?We also ordered chicken, mac n cheese and beans. ?Every part of this meal was incredible. ?Meat was incredibly tasty, moist and melted in my mouth. ?The service was incredibly friendly, welcoming and hospitable. ?Definitely worth it.

Sorry folks... Just 'cause they're both Southern, BBQ &amp; Po-boys don't mix.

Just ate at this place last night, it's in the neighborhood and we were delighted when we walked in. ?The place is full of life and we were lucky enough to get a place at the bar. ?The food was great, and I'm not a huge BBQ fan but my husband is and we both were satisfied. ?I love the pulled pork sandwich and I don't eat much meat, so that says something. ?The only reason this place is getting 4 stars and not 5 is the hope that the owners will read this review and GET A NEW SOUND SYSTEM! ?They play good music but it's coming from what looks like a bookshelf stereo and it's terrible. ?Please invest in a good sound system if you are going to play music that loud. ?Anyway, rant over, this place is very good and I really did like the customer service and there is no doubt that we will be back.

With all the hype around this spot, I wanted to be down, but found that maybe Baby Blue is guilty of trying to do a little too much. Most BBQ joints are good because they do one thing exceptionally well and stick to it. The food here is all over the map with three sauces to match, but I'm not feeling the eclectic approach. Beer-braised brisket was dry, pulled then served with a Carolina style vinegary sauce that didn't pair well for me. The Memphis ribs were better, but also on the dry side. Also, there's NO SMOKE in the place so it might be better to call this something alternative to BBQ which is probably the problem in a nutshell. There is no alternative to real BBQ.

I AM NEVER EATING HERE AGAIN!!! I have eaten here plenty of times and consider myself a regular since they first opened. Decent BBQ and sides, I usually stick with the Memphis Ribs since they pull their Beef Brisket and I don't prefer that. The reason I will never eat here again is due to the service I had received and nothing to do with the food although I caution the sweet tea as I've had sour tea due to unsanitary conditions. The short haired brunette mixed nationality looking waitress was already having issues when I arrived as she was on the phone when I walked in. Did not greet myself or my party, did not come over to offer water or ask if we wanted drinks and took forever to take our order. The worst was watching her comment to the cook while our food was sitting out and laughing, staring right at my girlfriend as if she had made some harassing comment. It is unfair to treat people wrongly due to your own personal issues and it is most definitely wrong to practice this while your working.

We have eaten at Baby Blues many times and really like the food a lot. ?But tonight when we visited, the service was really so awful that we had to write in. Our waitress was non-attentive and downright rude. ?Has Baby Blues gotten too cool to provide decent service? Trust me, we won't be back.

Oustanding. I have had the Memphis style pork ribs, and twice in one week at that. Furthermore, the 2nd time I had them ( a full rack of course) with no sauce. That is how good they are!!! Some places try and hide there mediocre ribs with sauce, but here they have nothing to hide. I highly recommed.

The food here is yummy. ?Not extremely gourmet, but tasty stuff. ?And they deliver.... kind of. ?Actually I called the place at 8:54 to order delivery and the guy said sorry, we stop delivering at 9. ?I said it's 8:54. ?He said yeah well tonight we stop delivering at 8:55. ?I repeated, it's 8:54. ?Really bummed on this place right now. ?Still hungry.

Ok...well I really tried to have some positive things to say about this place but I just can't bring myself to do it. First of all, we called and placed our order at 11:30 am...we are in the neighborhood and we did not get our food until 12:50pm...Needless to say, it was cold and the drinks were warm..Let's not forget to mention, THEY FORGOT THE BBQ SAUCE!!!! When we called to inform them of the situation, the young lady (didn't get her name) was very apologetic and resent a new order which wasn't any better, but they remembered the BBQ sauce.I have to applaud their effort in trying to "make it right", ?but BABY BLUE BBQ just falls short in doing so......This is our first and last time experiencing this so-called "BBQ"...

not bad. ? ? i'll definitely come here again. Their cornbread was probably my favorite. Imagine a brownie with corn instead of a chocolate. The ribs are great. The sweet potatoes were good too. minus a star, because I was very disappointed with the brisket.

Baby Blues started out good then we tried it a couple of times and the place looked like they never cleaned the floors or the tables and the staff most acted like they were getting over drinking tooo much the night before and the food kept changing in taste and when it comes to desserts, i think that the cake they serve was dry, at a BBQ place the desserts should apple pie, peach cobbler, sweet potato pie ect, not dry chocolate cake. ?needless to i stopped going there, waaaaaay toooo yuppie for me !!!!!!!!!!!!!

normally, I do updates so I can up my rating. sadly, this one brings down baby blues one star. i wanted to try their lunch specials 'cause they looked scrumptious and fairly reasonably priced. it would have all been enjoyable and I would have absorbed the document on housing rights and the fight for affordable housing SF history were it not for the #$%^&@! double doors being WIDE OPEN on a FRIGID DAY making the entire restaurant feel like a walk in cooler. I finally said something to one of the servers (oh, yeah, the one assigned to me seemed to also be a bit on the lackadaisical side, quite a contrast from the last time I was here) ?- he said that the owner keeps opening the doors. (!). Then I overheard the server talk to the owner - who uh, happened to be behind the grill and apparently was feeling hot - to which the server said "Well, of course you're hot, you're there by the grill, the rest of the restaurant isn't the same way!" (hooray for you oh server who wasn't the one assigned to me...). anyway, it wasn't for another several minutes before the doors were finally closed but by that time, I had already donned my jacket (which didn't do much on top of my 3 layers of clothing - that's how cold it was). Yup, just for that, 1 less star. And if I get sick from having gone through that frozen lunch, I'll knock off a couple more stars.

I've gotten delivery from this place and it was NOT worth it! ?Super cold. ?Blah. ?And I only live a couple blocks away. ?In person the place is pretty good! ?Huge servings, good food, huge servings. ?Did I mention their servings are huge? ?I did find a weird red plastic thing in my mashed potatoes once. ?Gross. ?Complimentary dessert. ?Whatever. ?Should've given me the meal for free if you ask me. ?A friend's burger was extremely undercooked on one of our visits. ?I think the sides are just okay. ?My husband loves the blue cheese stuffed burger. ?I like the baby back ribs! ?The decor in this place is seriously lacking--the area where the employees put their jackets and purses was RIGHT next to our table in the corner--strange having employees getting ready to work out in the open like that. ?Pretty weird if you ask me. ?Tables are overcrowded too. ?I go to this place because I like meat and it's close to my pad.

was really hoping to like this place. rainy day, too cold. hubby wants BBQ and in our 'hood AND they deliver... well, 75 minutes later they delivered. then, the delivery person has no change, so basically takes our money. ?$30 for a $22 meal... i mean, we gave him a tip for the rain and the effort, but then no change = massive tip for late, late cold BBQ. even called them to complain. was told manager would get back to us. yeah. right. sigh. and was so willing to cut slack even for average BBQ since they delivered...

Baby Blue BBQ is at the top of my list when it comes to Great BBQ in the city. We (3) went there on a Sunday afternoon soon after they opened ?and were seated right away by a very friendly host who also was our waiter. We ordered off the lunch special section of the menu, which had some very good deals on some delicious looking meals(served 12pm to 4pm daily) . 2 of us ordered ?the Cherokee Spike platter and one ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The wait for our food wasn't more than 10 mins. When it arrived , I couldn't believe the amount of food on the platter. The portions were huge. With a combo of pulled pork,hot link, and beef brisket, along with cornbread and a side of baked beans. It was hard to believe this was the lunch special (all for $11.95). The other platter ?person in our party got the side of cole slaw which was also delicious. The pulled pork sandwich was also huge with alot of meat and a topping of cole slaw , with a side of mashed sweet potato. Also very delicious. The total bill for us with 2 ice teas and 1 kool aid was $38.00. One of the best lunches we ever had in the city. We'll definately be back.
