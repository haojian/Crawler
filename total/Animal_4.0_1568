For one of my birthday dinners, my best friend decided to either buy me this pricey fringe leather skirt from Zara or take me out to dinner. Ive been dying to eat at this restaurant called Animal for the longest time. Its hipster, trendy, and absolutely terrible to find reservations at the last minute. We decide to aim right at opening to have seated arrangements at the bar which only occupy seven people at a time. We had altogether three people, myself, my cousin, and my friend Aaron. We decided at best to leave early and meet up to take those unreserved spots at the bar. After much complication, we did not arrive anywhere at our approximate time, due to traffic and passing the valet, not knowing where the location was. Eventually we walked up the street from the self parking lot and put our names down. Everyone was frustrated that we passed the restaurant (It was located right next to the Supreme Store), and we had an hour wait till the bar cleared up. Once sitting down I eagerly scanned the menu. There were a few things I personally wanted to try. We decided the best way to go is order 4-5 dishes, split them up and compare. One was the foie gras, fatty duck liver. In California this is banned from restaurants due to force feeding ducks is considered inhumane. I still never tried it, and seeing the menu had about 4 variations still, I was game. I asked my waiter what is one of his personal favorites on the menu. He recommended the pig ear with chili, lime, and fried egg. I picked the foie gras dish with biscuit and maple sausage gravy, and the poutine, oxtail gravy, with cheddar.  I wanted to also try something that would be considered bizarre to most people. I am not afraid of eating unusual foods, and I get a huge kick out of peoples expressions when listing in what I have indulged over the past years. Obviously I come to a choice of veal brains, vandouvan, apricot puree and carrot. Our dishes came out one by one in an orderly fashion. First to arrive was the pigs ear. I immediately grabbed my fork and cut through the center of the egg yolk. The egg oozed down and covered the dish making for a perfect first bite. With the egg and ear picking up the lime and chili along the way, I finally can say I enjoyed one of my favorite dishes I have ever eaten. How could a dish be so simple yet so good?? Especially if it is pig's ear?? The bites were so perfectly and deliciously balanced. I would definitely eat this for breakfast everyday or a late night snack. The veal brains came second. I thought the texture of brain was slightly odd but the the flavors of the Vandouvan combined with the apricot puree and carrot was a delicious combination. Vandouvan is a mix of Indian spices combined with onions, shallots and garlic. It most often used in French Cooking. I think that the brain did not match up to the subtle yet bold flavors of the dish. It was pretty good but certainly not my favorite. Next came my favorite guilty pleasure dish of the evening, poutine oxtail gravy and cheddar. Which to break it down, gravy with fries, a common French Canadian dish. I knew right off the bat, I definitely would love this dish. Who does not love fries and gravy!!? The poutine and cheddar was so rich, so fatty, yet so good. The only flaw, it was a little salty but I could definitely come back again and again for this taste of heaven. I was mortified when sitting behind the bar to see someone did not finish this dish at all. All of that poutine went to waste. Im still sad just picturing it.  .__. With one more dish remaining we came to the conclusion to have an order of balsamic pork ribs, corn & cherry tomato panzanella. As soon as the foie gras arrived and it was gone. Extremely fast. Kind of like how it is now gone from California. RIP FOIE GRAS :( The last one to arrive were the fall off the bone tender ribs. I barely even had to use my fork to cut through it. The preparation of the ribs was probably hands down most delicate ribs I have had, yet the flavor did not blow me out of the water. For dessert we tried the bacon chocolate crunch bar with the Salt and Pepper ice cream. Total foodgasm in my book. The chocolate was rich yet not super sweet, with the saltiness of the bacon complemented the ice cream. I could definitely have a bowl of that all to myself. I am definitely planning on coming back after having one of my better meals in a long time. Some people find the food overrated and I personally just find it delicious. The flavors were not complex in any way, yet with using exotic meats gives the restaurant a yummy spin. My only regret was not having the BBQ pork belly sandwiches, which my friend told me they are the best. I totally missed out on that one. I would recommend Animal to people who love to try new foods they never had, especially meat lovers. There should be at least one part of the menu that will make you satisfied.

This is a 4.5 star restaurant. I would actually call it one of the LA's most unique restaurant esp with the type of menu item they serve. BUT first of all you have to be quiet adventurous to enjoy the food here! Parking: valet parking available, street parking can be a little challenging and may require luck since it is on a busy street. Restaurant is fairly small and located on a big street so it is easy to miss. The place is relatively small and constantly filled with people. The menu is quiet simple! One page ONLY! the wine list is not so extensive either which makes it easier to decide. This is a family style restaurant where you share plates with everyone at the table. I would recommend coming here with either 2-4 people since some plates only come with 2 things so its easier to share. Food: For 2 you should aim for 5-6 menu items with 1 dessert chicken liver toast - this toast is very delicious! one of my fav dish of the night! It is rich and filled with a buttery flavor! If you like foie gras or liver type of item, you must order this! Keep in mind is $3 each marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions- the bone marrow is another one of my favorite dish since I love bone marrow. Def one of the best bone marrow dish I've every had after seeking out at diff restaurant for years! Its got the fatty flavor and juicy component and it just goes so well with the garlic/butter bread that they serve with it! Another must try item! tandoori octopus, tamarind, blood orange, raita - This dish is so unique! I am not a big octopus person but the type of dressing that's served with this dish really brings out the flavor of the octopus. I would def get this dish again! barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw - This dish is so fatty and juicy but a bit hard to eat because the pork belly falls off each time you bite into it. It is a bar type of food that require a lot of hand-washing. But the flavor of the bbq pork is amazing and pais so well with the slaw! poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - This is the least fav dish of the night! it is too salty for my personal taste and too oily. It is basically just oxtail over fries with cheese. Nothing too fancy or interesting. grilled quail, plum char-siu, peach, cherry, yogurt - This is another must order item. I've never liked quail but the way they prepare this dish is pretty amazing. The quail isn't really grill but more like fried. But the sauce that pair with this takes out all the grease and intensify the quail. Another one of my fav of the night. Dessert bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream - this item is featured on best thing ever ate! It basically taste like a nestle crunch bar served with caramelized bacon and syrup and ice cream. Not really all that fascinating but I did eat most of it by myself since I love dessert. You are welcome to try if you've never had any bacon related dessert! Overall, great experience! would def come back here to try their bro/sis restaurant son of a gun. I think they did a really good job trying to put these bazaar ingredient all together and actually make it appetizing and delicious!

Known for it's innovative menu and all things animal, this place has been on my list of places to try for as long as I can remember.  So I was more than stoked when I was taken here as a surprise dinner for an early Valentine's day this year.          Needless to say, I went on a rampage across the menu when we were finally seated after 30 minutes of waiting WITH a reservation.   (Which we didn't fuss about, both of us working in the restaurant business and having dealt with b*tchy customers and all)  Some of the dishes like the pig's head with pickled veggies, buffalo style pigtails, and the tandoori octopus with kumquat was a little too sour for my taste. But the excitement of trying something new and the dim, crowded, yet serene ambiance made the meal very memorable.      The seared foie gras with maple sausage and gravy, which is no longer available thanks to the idiotic banning in California, was like an upgraded version of a sausage mcgriddle.   Although I'm more of a salty-tooth than a sweet, this dish made reminded me of the 1st time I tried the McDonald's classic and thinking it was the best thing ever.  The veal brain with cumin was good the first few bites but I wished it was a little bit more crispy on the outside so I wasn't constantly thinking about spooning into some animal's head.  The tongue - pastrami style, was better however, slightly chewy, with subtle smokiness and the foie mousse coating every morsel.        Finished off with the bacon chocolate crunch bar.  It does taste good.  Not over the top, but good like everyone says on the other 5 million reviews.  Definitely think the peanut powder was the icing on the cake for me though.       Overall, I enjoyed this experience.  The offal dishes won me over and dining out with good company never fails.  I'll definitely be back to try other exciting creations these guys come up with, and hopefully get seated on my reservation time ;)

Bar none, this is one of the best meals I have had in LA.   The Petite Basque was outstanding.  It was a simple dish that really let the ingredients shine.   The fries on the poutine were just fries and nothing special, but the braised oxtail smothering was perfect.  It wasn't just gravy; it was a meat stew on top of fries. The fried pig's ear was only so-so.  The sauce was a bit to sour for the dish. The sweetbread dish was well designed with addition of the crawfish.   The duck breast was a bit underdone.  It made the meat a bit chewy, but the flavors were spot on. The pork belly sliders were ridiculous.  A great punch of flavor and a melt-you-mouth texture.  I think it was my favorite of the night. The flat iron steak was well cooked.  It was topped with truffle fondue that made the dish amazingly rich and earthy.   We finished with the chocolate bacon bar with salt and pepper ice cream.  The bar was good, not great.  The ice cream was outstanding. It had just a little heat from the pepper and not too much salt, just enough to bring out the sweet cream flavor. The service was perfect.  The host taking my reservation was extremely nice and accommodating.  Our server made excellent recommendations and took great care of us.  The prices, for the quality, were spot on.   I wish they had a full bar, I would have loved a gin to start the evening, but oh well.

I was really excited to come here because my friend had told me about the Foie Gras Loco Moco. However, since the Foir Gras ban that happened starting around July 1st, 2012, the restaurant doesn't serve it anymore. I just moved down to SoCal too in mid-July so I missed it by a couple weeks--oh well. My friend and I ordered a bunch of dishes that were new and interesting to us. This includes: 1) barbecue pork belly sandwiches, slaw 2) chicken fried sweetbreads, charred romaine, crawfish xo, creme fraiche 3) veal brains, vadouvan, apricot puree, carrot 4) marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions 5) poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar 6) crispy rabbit legs, sugar snap peas, chermoula aioli, meyer lemon These dishes plus a couple drinks ended up to be around $140 total after tax for the two of us. Was it worth it? Not really. The service wasn't even that great. It wasn't smooth like a 4 or 5 star restaurant deserves. I feel like the interior design could be better as well. There's lots of negative space on the walls which could be used. I like how the place has unique food and also its esoteric lack of a restaurant sign outside, but this place just didn't come through for me. The only thing that was 5 stars about this place was the barbecue pork belly sandwiches so get that for sure. The rest of the dishes were so-so. I would not come back here with the hundreds of other yummy restaurants in this area.

I miss the foie gras dishes, but this is still one of the most innovative places you can eat at in Los Angeles. It can be a little pricey, and while even though looking at the menu may lead you to believe otherwise, most of the plates are relatively small and you'll need to order a few to really have a full meal. The price is justified though. While the food is very rich, this is one of the most adventurous places I've eaten at in this city. That said, it's not a place to bring the kids or unadventurous eaters. The focus is on "meat," but it's more on the exotic variety; brains, sweetbreads, tongue, pig ear... but try it. Everything I've had here has been awesome. The hamachi tostada is incredible, and the pork belly sandwich is perfect. The sweetbreads are also amazing. I also recommend the chicken liver toast, especially considering the price. For three bucks, you get the ultimate appetizer intro. RIP foie gras biscuit with maple sausage gravy :( but don't think that the foie dishes are the only thing going for this place. Easily one of the best meals I've had in Los Angeles.

As the name suggests, this place is definitely not for vegetarians.  It is however a GREAT place to go with people who love meat!  We were there on a 'boys night' and the service was great.  Everyone agreed the rabbit and sausage spring rolls were amazing and like nothing any of us had tried before, I loved the pork ribs, they were cooked perfectly and not drowned in sauce.  Great wine selection also. Definitely try this place out, and make sure you'er hungry!

My hat goes off to Animal. The food is epic and the service was beyond good. Our server and bus boys were on top of everything. This was my second time eating here and it was better than my first experience, which was already good. We ordered almost everything because it was a boy's night out. I loved everything we ate. The petite basque and chicken liver always wins me over. I strongly suggest the rabbit and sausage spring rolls and the quail!!!! WOW I will go back any day of the week if the opportunity presents itself.

This was the best meal I had in LA but it wasn't perfect.  There were some really memorable items on the menu - the chicken liver toast was probably the best I've ever had, Quail Fry was the best tiny morsel of fried chicken I ever had - paired with amazing maple and grits.  The Bacon chocolate crunch bar with salt and pepper ice cream was also fantastic - not too sweet, a good amount of smokiness. The burrata was good but it didn't fit with what I ordered at all and tasted strange in between chicken liver toast and fried quail. My biggest gripe is with the pork belly sliders.  Yes the flavor was heavenly - a great mix of sweet and sour, but when I asked for the slaw to be left off since I don't like cole slaw or mayonnaise, the server politely said no.  Wtf?  I understand the no substitutions policy, but I was asking for something I don't like to be left off the plate.  This is the height of utter pretentiousness that makes me want to loathe hipsters.  And I'm sure the chef would personally tell me to f off and that he doesn't care what I think.  I still believe the customer is always right.   I ordered the balsamic ribs, which I asked to wrap up since we were full.  On the plate, it was served with beautiful tomatoes but when it ended up in the box, only the ribs were there.  Wtf? I loved that sparkling water was only 20 cents.  Expect to spend around $50/person.  Valet is $5.50.  Despite the annoyances I would return since sometimes were that good.  Hopefully by the time I return to LA, the foie gras ban will be overturned.

By far, one of our favorite restaurants. The food here is incredible. The restaurant itself is tiny and you definitely need to make reservations well in advance. The menu changes all the time, but these were some of our favorite dishes: hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut: This is my wife's absolute favorite dish. The first time we went here, we "shared" it. That was a mistake, because we each wanted our own. A perfect mixture of ingredients, it's one of the yummiest things you'll have. barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw: Too delicious and way too easy to eat. If you're not careful you'll want to just eat a thousand of these, it's that good. Foie Gras, Biscuit, Maple Sausage Gravy: Sadly, due to the ban on foie gras, Animal no longer serves this. But when they did, it was amazing. So delicious. Whenever my wife and I celebrate special occasions or just want to have a nice night out in LA, we take the trip out from San Bernardino and go to Animal and we are never disappointed. Excellent restaurant.

Nose to tail dining - I love it.  Creative, but simple and rich dishes. Very minimalist location, without much decor.  I liked the acoustics and the rotating music selection. On to the food, between the two of us I had: Burrata with gaucamole and charred onions - delicious homemade burrata, it didn't need the extras! Chicken Liver Toast - creamy, sweet with balsamic drizzle Spicy Beef Tendon Chips with pho dip  - it's like pork rinds! While spicy, I loved the onion pho dip, it was amazingly reminiscent of pho toppings - green onions, cilantro, star anise Marrow Bone - with a chimichurri sauce and caramelized onions, nice accompaniment, rich but with the slight acidity from the chimichurri sauce to offset Barbeque Pork Belly Sandwiches - slider sized, lots of mustard slaw, soft brioche bun and incredible tender pork belly with just the right ratio of fat Oxtail Poutine - with cheddar. Mmmmmmmm - so rich, tasty brown gravy, tender briskety oxtail meat. and of course, the Food Network famous - Bacon Chocolate Bar.  On the first bite, I tasted lots of smokey bacon crunchy bits.  It's a sliver of rich chocolate pate sprinkled with bacon.  Served with a salt and pepper ice cream, it is a great combination but a bit overhyped. Favourites were the Pork Belly Sandwiches and the Oxtail Poutine.  So sad that I didn't get to this place before the utterly ridiculous foie gras ban in Cali.

The BF was making up for a craptastic Vegas trip (Thanks a lot BS a$$ Insomniac) and was slick enough to book us a rezzie at Animal on Foiemageddon. SWEET. He knows me so well. My friend was a bit late due to traffic and some douches without a rezzie tried to steal my table! OH HEW NAH HEADROLL DOUBLE SNAP SNAP I WILL GO CHINESE GRANDMA MUNI BUS ON YOU! THIS GIRL CAN GET RATCHET OKAAAAAY?? He was standing off to the side telling his friend he is a devoted foie gras lover and that he would have his foie tonight one way or another before the ban. THEN he proceeded to tell the hostess that since THAT table was emptied *pointing at MY table* he should get it. 'Scuse you loser, if you were sooooooo avidly devoted as you claimed, YA AZZ WOULD'VE MADE A REZZIE, BOO BOO *said in Tammy of Basketball Wives voice*. Lucky for him, the hostess informed him that the table is reserved, my party is here but someone was stuck in some traffic down the street. I glowered at him from the waiting area while the BF held me back. Douche. Mad props to the hostesses at this place. People are so freaking impatient but you guys hold it down very well and have the system down to a T (while keeping it professional too) So now that I am done with the service.. The food itself.. 4.5 chicken liver toast ($3) good, but I think I could have skipped it. but meh, only $3 why not! pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg ($12) so bomb! many reviews have claimed that they didn't like the citrus and that it was too sour. I felt that the lime gave great acidity to the crispy pig ear, just enough to cut through the creamy yolk of the fried egg. I was thoroughly impressed with this and crave it every so often bbq pork belly sandwiches w/ slaw ($13) these are more like little sliders than sandwiches honestly. Still, they are quite delectable. marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions ($10) for me, this was just okay. the chimichurri was lacking and the caramelized onions were overpowering. BF agreed that Marlowe in SF does it better (and for only $2 more, you get the other half of the bone *ahem*) poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar ($18) this was really heavy and came out last. We couldn't even eat it by the time it arrived, we were stuffed to the gills! I only took one bite but I was so full that I don't even have thoughts on it. We shouldn't have ordered it, way too much food. foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy ($25) I didn't like this all that much. The biscuit was dry although smothered in maple sausage gravy. It was too sweet for me so it really killed the richness of the foie gras. foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger ($36)  WINNER. I am daydreaming and salivating over this as I type this review. Oh how I wish I could have one now for lunch! This dish is what made Animal stand apart from other places who serve offal cuisine. This dish... I still think about and probably will for months to come. Beautifully seared foie on top of medium rare hamburger with a thin slice of spam and perfectly sunnyside up quail egg on a bed of Vietnamese broken rice. *sigh* For those of you who had always wanted to come to Animal for this dish, I am sorry. You truly missed out. I'd come back for more crispy pig ears and probably to try other dishes. Oh, and my friend who was late? He had snagged me foie gras & jelly donuts from Umamicatessen. LOVE MY FRIENDS, LOVE MY BF. Y'all know me so well. P.S. Just be sure you have a reservation because if you try to swoop on my table....

Delicious food, terrific service.  You have to know that it's there, because the exterior has no name on it.  Although there's some bar seating that I gather is catch as catch can, you'd better get reservations.   I will go again.

Too excited for words, we got a table at Animal Restaurant, home of Bacon Chocolate and just before the Foie Gras ban in California, no less.  Right along Fairfax Ave, aptly adjacent to Canter's Delicatessen, Animal features Meats and Poultry by chefs Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo who have become established recognizable names in the culinary industry. The facade has no signs or any indication of restaurant's nomenclature, one has to guess or remember the building number, (oh boy, this is gonna be fun fun fun!) I can smell the architectural discomfort I'm about to experience...is there a stretching rack prepared upon arrival, or do I get a seat...... As was my dreaded fear, you walk inside into an asylum box; you can tell that this place had adopted the zeitgeist of minimalist /prison interiors: grey blanched color walls, hard surfaces that bounces noises like the inside of a cavern.... It's somehow become the norm to shout to your dinner companions all through dinner, I should have kept smoking, at least I would get to take a break from all noise....(just kidding-but I am gonna consider taking a noise break if this keeps up). I hope at least the food is colorful... Our first dish; the Hamachi Tostada- a ceviche of yellowtail with Herb Salad and crunchy Tostada strips.  The dish was light and good to open our palate, the Fish Sauce Vinaigrette provided a light acidity which complimented the Herbs, the hamachi, however wasn't my favorite component, it didn't taste as fresh as I would have liked and the Olive Oil didn't work to the Hamachi's advantage.  A new textural experience was the introduction of the Tostada, It was a new flavor profile to me and I thought the combination worked with the fish. The next dish was the Tandoori octopus with Tamarind, Kumquat and Raita. YUM!!!! The Octopus was cooked tender, preserving its chewy yet soft texture; a deconstructed take on an Indian dish, it had subtle flavors that you could relate to but never overpowered the focus on the protein. The complexity often found when eating Indian dishes were purified and clean; the Kumquat embodies sweet, Tamarind - savory, Raita - tart and the drizzle of oil completes the Tandoori. This dish thus began our foray into the soon-to-be extinct Foie Gras, slices of Veal Tongue coated with Pastrami spices melted in your mouth with Crab Apple Gelee and these thin wafers of Pumpernickel; it redefined a Deli classic! And then you have the Foie Gras Mousse Quenelle on the side representing the Chicken Liver but so much more sophisticated. It was a really good introduction into the meat/ protein dishes to come. A beautiful, sautéed piece of Foie Gras on top of a Lard Biscuit centered on a pool of luscious Maple and Sausage Cream Gravy.  It was a rich and decadent-all that you would expect from this type of dish.  In fact, it's a country dish reinterpreted with Foie Gras.  It was delicious, all that I would say is that it didn't have a contrasting texture or flavor to balance out the fatty creamy consistency of every component in this dish; it needed the inspiration that the other dishes were able to accomplish in redefining the classics. This was the most impressive dish of the night; the Pork Belly exceeded my expectations, blowing all other Pork Belly dishes I've eaten away... This was the ultimate -a gorgeous thick slice of Pork Belly, layers of fat and meat proportioned so well on a buttery toasted Brioche Bun topped with a Cabbage and Carrot Slaw.  It was the addition of this slaw that was a breakthrough flavor profile, it harmonized the meat and bread together, as well the Carrots in the slaw worked flawlessly for the Pork...loved this dish At the last minute in an act of spontaneity, we would go for one last Foie Gras hurrah, a take on a Hawaiian classic, it's a layered dish of Rice with Spam, Foie Gras and Hamburger with a Fired Quail Egg on top with a  twist on Ketchup and Scallions....I almost wish we  hadn't ordered this, it was sort of a mess. I like the classic version for what it is, a mish mash of flavors and proteins that are humble and filling. But in trying to elevate it with the Foie Gras, it became oddly disjointed, like the bottom half and the top half tasted great separately but was a bomb when you attempted to take a bite with all the components... Wanting to end the evening on a high note, we had to get the Dessert that these guys perfected: Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar with Salt and Pepper Ice Cream.  Wow, it's like being in the movie 'Inception', I don't know which reality I'm in; there's a rich sweet chocolate reality, then I'm whipped into a savory Bacon world, crunchy with hints of grease, then I'm shot into a Salt and Pepper awakening, which is not as jarring as it sounds.  Then you end in a Hazelnut haze, and ask yourself, 'what the f*ck just happened?' and you go for another bite....marvelous!! Ratings (Out of Five Stars) Food:          3.5 Ambience   2 Service:      3.25

Arrived here at 10:55pm with my bro after galavanting in Santa Monica 3rd Street Promenade. Shopping does get you hungry... so I heard. Anyways, the spot was incognito... no signs...  low key. No reservations made, but we did get a table after waiting no more than 10 minutes. I did notice great music playing as I was led to our table.    You get unlimited flat or carbonated water. We tried the bone marrow that was topped with chimmichirri. A piece of toast was provided, but I just wanted to spoon it. Then the chicken liver toast... it got a wide-eyed wow out of my bro. The pork belly sliders had toasted bread, slaw and tender swine.    We ordered just the right amount of food in my opinion. And yes, I saved room for dessert. The bacon crunch bar was a petite portion but rich, so it was fullfiling. Next time I see my butcher, I'm asking for some bones!

The final stop on our self inflicted foie gras tour, my expectations weren't all that high for Animal, as I'd heard from people I trust and a few I don't that the kitchen's skill maybe wasn't at the level of some of the other culinary hotspots around town. Still, I love the audacity of anywhere that takes the mystery out of what's on the menu and you don't get much clearer than calling your restaurant Animal. There really shouldn't be any negative reviews from lost vegans or pescetarians who wander in here by mistake. It turns out my qualms were completely unfounded. It is accurate that it's not as innovative as Ink, nor as perfectly executed as Providence yet it is quite relevant in its own parameters. One interesting note to our meal was that the exceptional plates were mostly the lesser known choices, while the popular dishes didn't quite live up to the hype but overall, the ups heavily outweighed the downs. The room itself is smaller and simpler than expected, and it was at moments quite loud but there's a nice rock soundtrack going above the din and anytime I hear Muse it puts a smile on my face. Service was really pleasant, helpful with suggestions to round out our orders and on top of things. Corkage was a reasonable $20. The evening began with Chicken Liver Toast, an exceptionally good version due to a sweet garnish that's the perfect compliment. Black Hogg has a very good version as well, but I think I prefer this one. Pig's Ear is one of my favorite delicacies, so I had high hopes to see what an American kitchen would do with them. Wistfully this was the biggest letdown of the evening. Spicy to the point of distraction, and with a citrus twist that didn't fit the spices of the dish at least for us, it's heavily Asian influenced. Veal Brains was a revelation. It's probably one of the least ordered dishes on the menu due to the headlining ingredient, but along with the equally stunning Veal Tongue, its the best reason to come here. Both were unique, tender, bold, flavorful, and most of all the kind of moments we all dream about having in restaurants. We sometimes call them "holy s#*$ moments" and to have two of them in one meal is both an extraordinarily rare and wonderful occasion. Certainly these choices are not for everyone, but if you have an adventurous spirit, it's worth taking a chance on them. Next came the reason for our visit. Animal is quite famous for their foie gras dishes, the Loco Moco in particular and in fact the current ban eradicates the restaurant's signature dish which is a shame but not the end of the world as it turns out. The Moco Loco is good, it has a filling and fully realized flavor, but because the ingredients are so rich and the recipe is so inflated the foie gras itself gets a little lost in the mix. Foie Gras with Maple Gravy was more successful, though it's still a wildly rich dish. The gravy is earthy but allows the essence of the foie gras to complement it. It feels though on some level, that the recipe could be made with something else and be equally delicious. I would venture to say that to really experience foie gras it should be in simpler and purer forms, like the transcendent versions at Bashan, Providence and Ink. Leave room for dessert, including the unmissable Bacon Crunch Bar. It's oddly subtle, rather ironic on the dessert menu of such a brazen restaurant. Equally good though less inventive is the house version of Tres Leches. Not to forgotten, a light and delicious Berry and Lavender crumble. They're all nice ways to get a happy ending here, can't really go wrong on the dessert menu. Food at Animal is big and bold, the way it should be for a restaurant of its namesake, and though it's not entirely consistent when it is good it's exceptional. Come in with an open mind and adventurous expectations and you'll likely leave fulfilled.

For my 100th review, one of my favorites. Animal! I have been here several times, most recent for dinner the night before the foie gras ban. Minimal decor, lively vibe. Intimate and dimly lit. This place is tiny so make reservations! Otherwise they have a handful of seats at the bar.  Service is always wonderful here. Metered street parking or valet. $20 corkage fee if you'd like to bring your own wine. Favorites: - Bone Marrow //   Buttery marrow topped with chimichurri and served with a side of light, buttery toast. Deliciously indulgent. - Oxtail Poutine //   Topped with cheddar. Rich, bold flavors. Also very heavy- If you're going to order this consider pairing it with lighter dishes. - Hamachi Tostada //   Light, subtle clean flavor. A way to start the meal. - Foie Gras Loco Moco //   A beautiful union of foie gras, quail egg, spam and hamburger. So rich and flavorful. One of the best foie gras dishes I've ever had. - Foie Gras Terrine //   With a side of date jam. Fantastically rich and buttery. Au revoir, foie gras!

Oh, Animal, how I love you so.   This place is one of my favorite restaurants.  I always leave feeling like I have to run 5 miles the next day but the food is just soooooooo worth it.  There are so many restaurants I go to where I think, "yeah this place is good" but after a month it was clearly forgettable.  I always remember the dishes at Animal so vividly that I can still taste it.  That's what makes this place a great dining institution.     I am praying that they 1) find a way to secretly serve their foie gras dishes still, or 2) open up a location somewhere outside of CA (but not too far away)  because their foie gras biscuit dish is by far the best foie gras dish I've ever eaten!!!  The creaminess of the foie gras paired with the buttery biscuit along with the sweet and savory maple sausage gravy...oh my goooooodness I can eat two of these in one sitting.  HEAVEN!! Moving on...their foie gras loco moco.  Also very decadent and delicious, I just wish there was more foie gras and egg :) Pork belly sliders - fatty, tender, fall-apart meat, flavorful, sweet, savory...paired with some crunchy slaw and all of it in between a toasted brioche bun.  Seriously, you cannot go wrong. Grilled octopus & chorizo - I ordered this once and fell in love!!!  The octopus was charred nicely and so tender.  A lot of people assume octopus is rubbery but if it's prepared correctly, it is amazing!  This dish came w/ chorizo and some pepper relish.  Again, Animal never ceases to amaze me with how thoughtful their dishes are.  All of the flavors and textures are perfectly balanced.  LOVED this.  Sadly, I came back another time and they didn't have this on the menu anymore.   Bone marrow - I don't think I've ever NOT enjoyed a bone marrow dish.  I love bone marrow, I love chimichurri, and I love brioche.  So in conclusion, I love this dish. Chocolate bacon bar - YES YES YES.  Get it. Thank you, Animal, for always putting a smile on my face every time I visit you :)

Animal is a bit overrated in my opinion. My boyfriend really didn't care for this place, dunno why he rated it 3. I thought he'd rate it 2 or something. We ordered: hamachi tostada liver toast veal brain braised short ribs Oddly enough, the only thing I truly enjoyed was the liver toast. It was 1 slice of dinky toast for 4bucks or something though....wut. who pays 4 bucks for 1 dinky slice of toast. I left this restaurant still hungry. I'm giving it 3 stars because the service was great & honestly the dishes are extremely unique. I give em props for being creative. But honestly, if I'm craving some intestines or beef tongue or whatever innards etc, I am definitely opting for some taiwanese restaurant instead. They get those things down.

Unfortunate for you, all the things I love about Animal are now no more.  Namely, the foie gras dishes.   The foie gras biscuit was definitely delicious.  My personal favorite was the agnolotti. That liquid foie gras was pure f-ing magic.  The loco moco is a little overload with the spam and patty and foie.   Fortunate for you that you can still get the bone marrow and a plethora of other tasty dishes.   Foie gras, gone but not forgotten.  Repeal the ban!

I came to Animal for dinner a few weeks ago to indulge myself with foie gras before July 1st. Since the restaurant was completely booked up, I took my chances at the bar. It was about a 2 hour wait, so off the nearest bar we went to pass the time... And about 2 hours later, we were seated at the bar and was ready to eat. We ordered the following: - foie gras agnolotti - foie gras terrine - foie gras with biscuit and maple gravy - oxtail poutine - foie gras loco moco My favorite of the night was the agnolotti. The liquid foie gras made me speechless - no joke. The loco moco was always my favorite dish at Animal, but the agnolotti definitely trumped it. The terrine was good, but I still preferred the biscuit and loco moco better. In the biscuit dish, the richness of the foie gras go well with the sweetness of the maple - great salty and sweet combo. The loco moco is pretty heavy, but a definite must order. Go big or go home, right? The poutine is always good, so no surprise there. Since we were only a party of 2, we had a tough time finishing our meal especially since we already had a couple of drinks in us pre-dinner. I'm glad I waited it out for the bar and experienced the foie gras gluttony before the ban. I did feel super uncomfortably full afterwards, but still worth every bite!

If you ain't a carnivore or a meat lover, I do not recommend coming here! You would be VERY limited in dishes....This is just purely the definition of what heaven for carnivore's tastes like!  My friend luckily scored a reservation at 10:30pm on a Friday Night.  I just got off the airplane at around 9:30pm and jetted directly to the restaurant. I was hungry so it was totally worth it!  The venue screams out minimalist, with its wooden furniture and plain walls.  The meat makes up for it! Ordered: 1. Chicken liver toast- $3 a toast. we decided to order one for each person! I had to be selfish. This was more of a rich pate but with the sweet topping, it balanced the strong pate very well. 2. Marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions- the most generous portion of bone marrow I have ever eaten or seen at a restaurant.  This was absolutely delicious. a MUST to order if you love or don't mind eating expensive fat :) If you need more baguette pieces, they actually charge you $1 for each additional one. a bit lame but it's okay 3. Pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg- recommended by our waiter. I would say this was my least favorite one. The lime was very overpowering but not bad noneless. 4. Barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw- once again, expensive fat made it on the top items that we ordered. SO tender and juicy. It comes in 2 sliders. 5. Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar- I think i expected more from this dish since I love poutines from Canada.  At least the oxtail was fatty and juicy which made up for the dish.  Very big dish also, so it is a definite share 6. Grilled quail, plum char-siu, peach, cherry, yogurt- tasty but a bit too salty for me. It comes with 2 quails and nicely plated. Animal definitely serves an unique dining experience with all its different types of meats that they have available. Too bad foie gras is banned in CA, or else I am sure I would of enjoyed it ten times more with the popular foie dishes they used to have! I recommend! :)

My sister and I are foie gras people and I know it's a sad and horrible thing to the ducks but OMG, so good. Duck.Fat. So went with a group of friends - Richard P and John H and my non Yelp friends - my sis and her hubby - and had to get some foie gras before the ban. I've never eaten so much foie gras since the ban coming up! FOOD: * Chicken liver toast - OMG. SO good. It was just SO good. Worth the $3. * Marrow Bone, Chimichurri, Caramalized Onion - I don't eat this... it's beef. * Pig Ear, chili, lime, fried egg - pretty crispy. I felt like I was eating thick chips - the good kind. * Putine, oxtail, cheddar - I can't eat these. * Duck Breast, charred cabbage, liptauer mustard - the potatoes were SO good. I like the texture of the duck. Not hard, not soft. * foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger - I just ate the foie gras and egg... it was alright. Not my fave of the foie gras. Kinda rich. * hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut - Very light, you need to break it yourself but very good. Kinda small. liquid foid gras agnolotti - This was GOOD. It's like dumpling style where there is juice inside. OMG. So good. It was like soup! :D Foie Gras with Biscuit and Maple Sausage Gravy - MY FAVORITE. I ate TWO of these. :P berries, vanilla custard, lavender crumble, opal basil - Like Panna cotta... good but eh... tres leches, dulce de leche - FAVORITE bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream - Ehhhh... I could pass. nectarine, angle food cake - Very tarty... Pass. OVERALL: This is good food. My stomach was STUFFED. AMBIANCE: Very Hollywood. Very small and loud and crowded but you pay for this ambiance. Very trendy. SERVICE: Standard. They were helpful and came around a lot... OH... and they were HOT. Those waiters... HOT. I'm like WHOA. I need to eat my food slowly or else I'd choke. HOT. Models/actors HOT. PARKING: Street parking or valet. Street parking is actually... there is actually a lot. :P Probably bc we went on a weekday. GTR Friendly: No OVERALL: Yes... worth the hype

Went here on Dec. 28, 2011. We tried making reservations for a party of 3 but they were booked solid, probably because of all the hype plus being around the holidays. We decided to go there and try for bar seating anyway! We figured, the worst thing that could happen was that we'd have to find a new place to dine at. We went there; we put our names down; and had some drinks at the place across the street!  Less than 30 minutes later, they called us and told us our table was ready!  Very awesome considering we were told over the phone there were no openings. We tried several things from the menu but the ones that vividly stood out and that I would highly recommend would be the: 1) foie gras loco moco 2) bbq pork belly sandwiches 3) bacon chocolate crunchbar I enjoyed but wouldn't order the following things again: veal sweatbread and the poutine. Overall it was a great experience. We had great service. The place is so busy that it did not feel pretentious.  The decor and ambiance work nicely together. The place was decorated minimally but classy almost like a design studio/gallery.  I would definitely come back!

Animal has been on my list for too long, and once I found out Foie Gras would be illegal in CA, I HAD to come here! Reservations were booked for a month since Foie Gras became illegal on July 1. Me and my friend decided to try our luck by waiting in line to be seated at the bar, which is only 7 seats! We got there right when it opened and there was already a long list of people ahead of us. The hostess told us it'd be 2-3 hours at least, and when we returned 3 hours later, she told us it'd be another couple hours... We finally came back 30 min before closing and were the last ones seated---I was starving at this point, but at least we got seated at a table! :D I felt rushed to order, since it was last call right when we sat down. We ordered all the Foie Gras sausage biscuit & gravy, Foie Gras loco moco, fried pig ear, chicken liver toast, and bbq pork belly sliders. I was so rushed I forgot to order the bone marrow... next time i guess. Chicken Liver Toast: Only $3 and it was delicious! Toasted baquette with a spread of chicken liver. Similar flavor as Foie Gras, but not as fatty (has the flavor, but it doesn't "melt in your mouth" like Foie Gras). I'm definitely ordering this again! Foie Gras Sausage Biscuits & Gravy: My favorite! The Foie was seared perfectly and the flavors of the sausage biscuits and gravy complimented the Foie nicely. I think the sausage was a little too salty (a bit over powering when eating it with the Foie). Foie Gras Loco Moco: This was basically white rice, topped with a burger patty, spam, foie gras, and a fried quail egg, served with some sort of teriyaki sauce and some sriracha. The presentation was beautiful, but the chef suggested that we mix all the ingredients together--great tip! I think the dish could have gone without the spam because it made the whole dish too salty (but then again, it wouldn't be "loco moco." Altogether, it was a creative dish, but the highlight of it was the Foie! :] I miss you already! Fried Pig Ear: Strips of fried pig ear, served with chile sauce and topped with a fried egg. The sauce had a kick to it and the runny egg yolk complimented the flavors (and spice) of the pig ear nicely, but I didn't really like this dish too much :X Pork Belly Sandwich/Sliders: This was melt in your mouth delicious, and the pork belly was cooked perfectly (very tender) but it was pretty fatty! The buns were nice and soft, and the bbq flavor was nice and tangy. You should definitely MAKE RESERVATIONS before you go, it will save you a lottt of time, and will guarantee you a seat/table.

Anybody who didn't give this place 5 stars needs to have their fingers removed so they can never write another review for yelp again. My wife and I ate here and didn't have a bad bite. If you are not adventurous eaters then this place might not be for you, but if you like bone marrow, pigs ears, and sweet breads then this place will make you salivate like Niagara falls.  The dishes here are bigger then tapas but small enough for two people to share 5 fun dishes. Hamachi tostada- Really nice way to awaken the pallet. seasoned perfectly with perfect salty to savory ratio with the acid to kick you in the no no zone. Bone Marrow chimi churi- Wow, this was ridicules. The wifey normally doesn't get down with the bone marrow but this one got the stamp of approval and won her over in the marrow department. The churi was the perfect accompaniment to the fatty slow roasted marrow. I could eat that every day. Rabbit legs with cherimoya aioli- probably my least favorite of the night but you can't hit home runs all the time. This dish was a solid triple I just wanted the cherimoya taste to come through more prominently. Biscuit and sausage gravy with foie gras- where do I began. Amazing biscuit siting in a pool of Succulent sausage gravy with a hint maple syrup is enough to literally make my mouth water as I write this. The Foie GRAS was prepared with an expert hand with care and amazing detail. Being that foie gras is now illegal makes this bite of food extra special and a way to remember my beloved foie. Oxtail poutine- imagine the most gourmet drunk food. In fact Tommy's burger chili fries but gourmet. Extremely rich but perfect with a nice IPA. They serve Point The Way which is rad being that they support local brewery's. Desert- We went with the Bacon bar with Salt and Pepper ice cream. They say everything is better with bacon but I guess I built it up is my head to much. It was good but I probably wouldn't order it again. Decor - simple nice with a hipster vibe parking is slim so you have to valet. We parked at the grove and caught a movie and walked.

I ate so much that I felt like throwing up. Too much of a good thing can be a bad haha. I've been dying to dine at Animal and with the ban of foie gras quickly approaching, I had a good occasion to finally make a reservation. I called two weeks ahead and scored a reservation for 11pm. The restaurant was completely booked up due to the foie gras craze. Jimmy and I arrived 30 minutes early and enjoyed some wine at the bar. We were promptly seated at 10:50pm. Kudos to the host for staying ontop of all the reservations. It was a zoo outside, with at least 30 people waiting to score a seat. I've heard people complain that Animal is too heavy and too gluttonous, so I was a little worried. Could Animal live up to the hype? Abso-effin-lutely! I was careful not to order too many dishes with heavy sauces, so the meal was somewhat balanced. As much as possible anyway. I recommend ordering at least 4-5 items for two people. We ordered 8, but that's only because I eat a lot. HAHA. chicken liver toast $3 -- We had to order two servings because we both love chicken liver and GOOD THING. I make this at home all the time, but this was much more refined. The caramelized onions added a nice contrast in flavor to the liver. The toast was perfectly grilled and charred. The chicken liver was layered on pretty thin though and I felt the ratio was a bit off. pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg $12 -- This was very tasty and unique. The pig ear was sliced thin and perfectly crispy. It had a lot of Mexican elements to it with the chili and lime. The fried egg really balanced out the citrus bite from the sauce. I had a few pieces that had soaked up too much lime juice though. Super sour! barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw $13 -- I took one bite and got extremely quiet. Jimmy knew immediately that I liked it because I started smiling! This was ridiculously good. The BEST pork belly dish I've ever had. Better than Momofuku's pork bun and The Chairman baked pork belly bun (my old faves). Things got kinda messy, but I don't care. The pork belly was cooked to perfection; crispy on the outside, fat rendered, meaty bits were so soft. Just incredible.   grilled quail, plum char-siu, nectarine, cherry, yogurt $19 -- Our favorite dish of the night. The portion was very meager for this dish. Think 4 pieces the size of chicken wings. Regardless, this was the best preparation of quail I've ever had. The plum chair-siu was better than my mama's sauce: sticky, sweet, and savory. The nectarine, cherry, and yogurt added a cool contrast, freshness and brightness to the dish. The quail was so juicy and the meat fell off the bone. I tried to eat like a lady, but I couldn't help but nibble on the bone for a minute. duck breast, charred cabbage, liptauer, mustard $21 -- This was the weakest savory dish of the night for me. The smokey flavors was nice and I liked the mustard sauce. The charred cabbage is as good as cabbage can be. Unfortunately, the fat was not rendered off enough. It could have used another minute or two on the pan to burn off the fat and crisp up the skin. foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger $36 -- I made the mistake of ordering this instead of the terrine. This dish was delicious and I loved every bite, but there was so much going on that the beauty and flavor of foie gras was lost. The burger was the star for me: charred, medium-rare, and well seasoned. The portion of foie gras was also very meager in this dish.   bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream $7 -- Did not live up to the hype. Way too sweet and there was nothing to balance it out. I did like the crunchy bits, but that is all. 2010 St. Magdalener, 'Grobnerhof,' Erste + Neue, Alto Adige 15 glass/28 carafe/58 bottle -- Still young, but very good. It didn't open up at all though. Unlimited sparkling or still Natura filtered water for 20 cents per person. We didn't see our server much and dealt mainly with the runners. Everyone was so friendly and nice, even in the chaotic climate inside the restaurant. My biggest gripe with service: the pacing of our courses was so rushed! We were in and out in ONE HOUR. 7 course in one hour is ridiculous. Jimmy and I didn't even get a moment to breathe or enjoy any of our dishes. I know they were completely full, but still... All in all, a very satisfying meal and we'll be back after we work off all the calories!

It's been a while since we ate here so I might be a little fuzzy on the details.  I believe it was a Saturday night (early) and showed up without reservations (oops).  Even though the restaurant was practically empty (I think they just opened) she informed us that it would be a couple hours before we could be seated.  No problem.  We went to the bar across the street which I imagine gets plenty of business from people being turned away from Animal. We ordered quite a few things.  The most memorable was the sheep's brain because it was AWFUL.  I've eaten a lot of things in my time from hearts to bugs and this literally had me gagging.  I don't think this was the chef's fault but the texture of the brain was so mushy and foamy...I just couldn't hang with it.   We also ordered the barbecue pork belly sandwiches which were tasty and very very fatty.  Also tried the pig head which if I remember correctly had a balsamic flavor to it.  And of course we ordered the bone marrow which came out last.  We were so full and everything had such a heavy, greasy flavor that this set us over the edge.  We were both literally sick for hours afterwards.   I would recommend trying to order a mixture of heavy and light items which might be kind of tricky because many of their items are so heavy and greasy.  I give them props for such an original menu though.

Our recent dinner at Animal Restaurant was offally good. I have been a huge fan of the superstar team of Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo for many years now. Following them both at Animal and their more seafood-centric endeavor Son of a Gun. Animal is one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles and with the impending foie ban, we've been trying to make our way over there as often as our schedules (and wallets) allow. There is a reason why Animal on Fairfax is packed with diners every night. Aside from offering a selection of meaty delights with an accessible gourmet approach, their innovation and strong nose-to-tail philosophy can please any palate willing to open their minds to something new. With California's aforementioned foie gras ban taking affect in a couple of days, I knew I just had to have some of my favorite dishes including their sinful rendition of biscuits and gravy. Not into foie so much? Not to worry, there isn't a single thing on this menu that I wouldn't gladly recommend. We ordered about 6 dishes to share and brought our own bottle of wine (with reasonable corkage). It goes without saying that the service the entire night was spot-on. Courses came out in a timely fashion, our waiter was funny and charming, and the hostesses are warm and prompt. It's the little things like these that make a good meal great. The order: We started with the Sliced Pig's Head; beautifully fatty head cheese served with hush puppy croutons and a tart pickled ramp vinaigrette. This dish was a good start to the meal with its brightness and acidity. We then moved on to the Foie Gras Biscuits and Gravy (one of my most favorite foie gras dishes on the planet). Decadent and comforting in every sense of the word, this is the single foie gras dish that I will sorely miss during this ridiculous ban. In an ideal world, the Animal boys will serve it anyway (Chicago Foie Ban style), but it is too soon to tell. The perfectly seared foie on top of maple sausage gravy and a fluffy homemade biscuit just about makes me want to weep. For our third and fourth courses, we went for their Pork Belly Sliders and the Chicken Fried Sweetbreads. The two small sliders were filled with a nicely-sized chunk of tender char sui-style barbecue pork and just the right amount of fresh slaw on a soft brioche bun- nothing out of the ordinary, but seriously good. The sweetbreads, while the least memorable out of the bunch, were perfectly breaded and fried to a crisp; served with grilled romaine and a crawfish xo sauce. If you're afraid of trying offal, these are a good start- they're more like popcorn chicken than anything else. Our fifth and sixth courses were definitely the heavier ones of the meal. The Braised Oxtail Poutine with Cheddar was phenomenal. In fact, this simple but satisfying dish puts many other poutine dishes to shame. If only this was served in every bar in town. Lastly, one of the most controversial foie gras dishes in town, the Foie Gras Loco Moco (pictured at the top of this post). On paper, it may seem like a terrible idea, but believe you me, it's delicious. A fried quail egg on top of seared foie gras on top of a hamburger patty on top of a slice of Spam (yes,that Spam),on top of white rice within a bed of au jus and scallions. Indulgent, although the biscuits and gravy are still number one with me. As we made our attempt to stay awake during our post-dinner food coma, we decided to skip dessert and head to the bar for a digestif instead. There's no telling how long this ban will last, or if it will even be enforced, but I'm at least glad that we were able to come in for one last hurrah. Good thing they've got a menu to keep us coming back- foie or no foie.

The food at Animal was definitely unique, but the taste was very ordinary. There was not one dish that stood out for me; not even any of the desserts. None of the food was bad, but if I'm going to spend that much for food, something better taste awesome.

This review is a bit late in coming as I was there a little while ago, but I still recommend this restaurant to friends in the LA-area. It's slightly pricey, but not too bad when you're all splitting dishes. I love how adventurous the menu is (pig's feet, pig tail, veal, tongue, etc). My friends were a little less adventurous, but everything we tried was super tasty. The melon salad and goat cheese salad were good; the balsamic ribs great; the raviolo amazing. The bacon crunch bar and bread pudding we had for dessert were divine.

Animal. Animal. Animal. Are you a vegetarian? Concerned with your cholesterol? Or are you feeling uncomfortable eating animal parts? Don't stay away just yet. I know overcoming those obstacles seems impossible, but try it anyway because you might as well like it. This restaurant is fairly small with a capacity of about 40 people. Also, judging from reading thousands of reviews about making reservation, it is no doubt a must do thing in advance. The restaurant is located near Fairfax and Beverly intersection where street parking can be a pain; however, with a late night reservation, there should not be any problem. Besides, there is no sign of ANIMAL whatsoever, if you see 433 sign, you've arrived at the place. Decor is simple. Small tables and dim lighting at night give patrons the feeling of warmth and intimacy. Customer service is great. Our waiters are very friendly and accommodating. Menu is presented on a single A4 sheet of paper and consisted of more than 20 different dishes. The name of each dish may sound exotic, but the food itself is prepared and cooked so that animal parts look nothing like their original forms. We ordered six dishes and enjoyed every single one. Furthermore, plating of food is elegant and give great aesthetic pleasure. 1. Chicken Liver Toast - For $3, it was finger-licking-fantastic. We ordered only one for two people and ended up fighting against each other for the tiny last bite. 2. Pig ear, Chili, Lime, Fried Egg - Ears? I've never been adventurous about food. Pg ear at first sounded awful but later I myself discovered this dish as such a good snack. Pig ear was crunchy, chili and lime brought in acidity and spiciness, and yolk from the fried egg was smooth and ooey. Together, they create a must-try dish. 3. Barbeque Pork Belly Sandwiches, Slaw - The buns was nicely toasted. Cole slaw created a fresh palate. Pork belly carried a crispy skin on the outside and was succulent in the inside. Yum! 4. Foie Gras, Biscuit, Maple Sausage Gravy - Flavors are extremely rich. I am not a fan of biscuit in general, but I am in love foie gras. What is the better way of spending $25 for this tiny portion pf goodness? 5. Berries, Vanilla Custard, Lavender Crumble, Opal Basil - The berries were fresh, and the custard was subtly sweet and smooth like silk. The dish was divine. 6. Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar, salt and pepper ice cream - Crunchy. Salty. Sweet. Chocolaty. No matter how others thought this dish was overrated, our taste buds were definitely on the dance floor. From service to food, everything was superb. We will surely return in the future.

The food was good. The only thing I didn't like was the balsamic pork ribs...the vinegar was overpowering. I ordered the poutine fries with oxtail gravy, which I thought was absolutely delicious and very filling. The bone marrow was good...very creamy and buttery. It was one of my favorite orders. The foie gras loco moco was interesting with spam in it...kind of salty for my taste. Overall all the food was good, but I will have to try other dishes when I go back. A Place fit for foodies!

Welcome food lovers, and pretentious LAers. (Son of a gun beats Animal. Just sayin.) Oh Animal, the most "LA" of restaurants there is. Of my two failed attempts making reservations (because they were all booked for the week... of course), I finally got a chance to try Animal after falling in love with Son of a Gun. The usual with these places... MAKE RESERVATIONS IN ADVANCE, obscure and hard to find, with no sign in the front, cozy yet classy decor with dim lighting. Parking is easy on side streets. After being seated, I was but was not surprised about the menu...everything seemed strange, exotic, exciting, and sounded delicioussssss. My friends and I ordered... CHICKEN LIVER TOAST. Why are you only $3 a pop? This was actually MY FAVORITE part of the meal. Every bite was so good, with the crunchy, creamy, salty, sweet. I am actually salivating thinking about it right now. If I ever come back here, this is all I'm getting. Bone Marrow. What is this ... semi-warm...semi spicy...few droplets of actual bone marrow concoction? Did I just pay $10 for caramelized onions? I normally love bone marrow, but I just really was not a fan of the taste. Oxtail Poutine. Good flavors, but a little too bold for fries drenched in gravy. It gets heavy real fast, so if you must try, share with someone! And ask for extra water. You'll need it. Pork Belly Sliders. YUM at the first bite, then not so yum. I wish they'd tell you these come in twos. The pork belly wasn't really that "melt in your mouth" type, it was pretty chewy actually. Good flavors nonetheless, but again, share. It gets overwhelming. Foie Gras with Biscuit and Maple Sausage Gravy. Oh my love for Foie Gras, but definitely on the sweeter side. I have surely never tasted anything like this before. Must get. TIP: It's not going to be a cheap meal here, for sure. But splitting dishes with others on your table will let you try more, spend less, for an overall better experience.

I dined here on August 9, 2011, and it was a first class experience from start to finish.  The positive experience began when I called just before my reservation because I was stuck in traffic; the hostess was very accommodating, and assured me they could serve me as a solo diner as long as I was done in 1.5 hours because they had a large party arriving; that's great, explicit communication that I appreciated. When I arrived, I found a place to park near the restaurant.  I parked and went to pay the meter; their valet generously pointed out a potential violation I hadn't noticed, and I was able to move the car slightly to avoid a ticket!  More great communication. I was quickly seated, and my server offered to get me a drink.  I explained I needed to figure out what I was ordering for food, and then would need his help with wine pairing.  He not only understood my desire, but ended up giving me an ideal pairing given the diverse food that I ordered.  WIN! The food:  GLORIOUS!  What amazing flavors! Chicken liver toast:  it sounds boring, but I love chicken livers, and heard this was a great dish.  It was!  A piece of grilled toast, schmeared with pureed chicken livers, and topped with quince paste and I believe ground pepper and sea salt.  Every bite was perfection.  Every taste bud on my palate got attention.  5 stars! Rabbit loin springroll:  This was the most artistic presentation, a plate with several pieces of the springroll, and a bit of green curry, some eggplant, and elements of salad whose identity I don't recall.  There were so many ways to create tasty bites, and each combo was delightful.  A very playful and flavorful dish that allow the tastes of each element to shine. Halibut:  I knew this would be a real test of the kitchen's talent.  Halibut is notoriously easy to overcook so that it comes out dry and unpleasant.  The Animal chefs handled it with aplomb.  It had been poached, and then served in the poaching broth with some chanterelles and asparagus.   Culinary perfection!  This stands as the single best piece of halibut I have ever tasted.   As I said above, the wine, a white blend from Burgundy, was ideal with all three courses, and was delicious on its own.   When I was done, I got my check, paid it, and departed with a huge smile on my face.  My only regret is that I didn't return when I visited LA in February 2012.  My loss, and that is a lesson learned.  Thank you, Animal, for a wonderful evening with long-lasting happy memories.

Damn I wish I was able to hit up Animal before the foie ban.  I have no doubt that they would have a had a good foie.  Overall this place is popular.  We had reservations, but we saw them turn away nearly every party that came in without reservations.  We ordered: - Chicken liver toast- Good flavor, but would have preferred if they separated the liver form the toast so that we could decide how much liver to put on each piece. - Hamachi- My favorite dish of the night.  Subtle, clean flavor - Soft shelled crab- Flavors similar to a spicy salsa.  Overall surprisingly spicy, really has a real kick to it. - Marrow bone- not bad, but hard to taste the marrow, as it's much more subtle than the seasoning - Pork ribs-  Falls of the bone.  Very tender. Overall good flavors, but as the dishes are more tapas like, so the bill can definitely add up.

Months before. Panicked because of CA foie gras ban. 2:00 pm Called the restaurant. The restaurant is fully booked until the end of the month. 5:30pm We got there and the line was already long for walk-in. 6:00 pm-getting hungry Checked in with the host. 6:00 pm-9:30 pm-hungry Walked around, clipped nails, cleaned car, played games, took a nap, ate Littlejohn English toffee, drank strawberry lemonade, watched weirdos. 9:30 pm-starving Seated at the restaurant. Ordered 2 foie gras, biscuit , maple sausage grave, 2 chicken liver toasts and veal tongue smoked foie gras, pastrami spices, crab apple.  I refused to share my foie gras. 9:45 pm-hungry Got my veal tongue and chicken liver toast.   Chicken liver toast ($3.00): the liver itself was kinda good but the toast was a little too crunchy.  It was kinda hard biting the toast.  I like the sweet jam (?) on top.  3.5 stars!! Veal tongue, smoked foie gras, pastrami spices, crab apple ($14.00): it was a beautiful presentation and the taste was kinda yum when I ate them separately.  For some reason the taste didnt go together when I combined them.  3.5 stars!! 10:15 pm-hungry Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy ($25): the foie gras was good but not the best I had.  The biscuit was very good and the maple sausage gravy was a tad too sweet for me.  Again, every single component was delicious when eaten separately.  I couldnt taste the foie gras when I ate it with the biscuit or gravy.  3.5 stars. 10:28 pm-hungry Passed out in my car.  That foie gras dish was so rich ;) We contribute $3 to CHEFS (Coalition for Humane & Ethical Farming Standards) because the restaurant donate $1 for every foie gras dish sold. 3.5 stars!!  My rating is based solely on the food I ate.  No deduction for  the waiting time because I didnt have a reservation and it's my fault to dine last minutes. Street parking.  20 cents per person charged for unlimited sparkling or natural filtered water.  Great customer service. Animal is kinda yummylicious!! Getting ready for review #1500.

Had the pleasure of dining here as a foodie friend of mine was getting set to leave LA and wanted to do one more round of all his favorite restaurants. I'm a semi-suspicious observer of the whole molecular gastronomy movement myself, despite my PhD in chemistry, but have to say I found the food here playful in presentation and flavor profile, without going too far outside boundaries in terms of tradition. Several things that I like.  A terrific pairing of beers and wines to go with your meal.  They serve the food from mildest flavor to boldest, so you work your way up to the fireworks, flavor-wise.  And finally, the end price tag, for two people who shared 6 dishes, dessert and drinks, was exceptionally reasonable.  This is a world-class dining experience in LA for a not-exorbitant "see and be seen" price tag. Now, the food.... The pork belly sliders (a take on Southern-style pulled pork sandwiches) and the bacon chocolate bar dessert (a sinful mix of salty and sweet), I'd sell my soul for. Not to be missed. The kale salad, liver pate toast and albacore neck were surprisingly delicate, while all bursting with flavor.  I mean albacore paired with blood orange slices?  Kill me now! All in all, worth the hype and the headlines, and won't break your wallet.  You have nothing to lose. A few words of caution:  parking is super tight, so plan ahead, the reservations are set in stone, so if you're 15 minutes late you lose your table (so plan ahead), and this restaurant is NOT for vegetarians.

OVERHYPED...OVERPRICED.  I gave this place a chance, but in the back of my mind the whole night, I was just thinking "What the hell are these people thinking eating here?!"  Went here on a Tuesday night, had reservations for 9:15pm, got sat down roughly around 9:45, WITH A RESERVATION, are you kidding me?  At least the hostess was cute. Ok, we get sat down, it's impossible to hear our waiter, because it's too LOUD in there, how the hell can you hear your friends like that?!  Ordered around 6-7 plates (rabbit portion size) averaging around 15-23 dollars a plate.  Yowza, I felt so robbed by the end of the night. Portions:  Tiny, if you're hungry, FORGET about going to this place, unless you want to drop over $100 on just your part of the tab alone (easily).  And even if you have the money, why would you want to do that?  The food is mediocre at best.  Imagine a chef thinking of the most disgusting things to prepare on a plate, and then decides to slap a ridiculous price tag on it, that's EXACTLY the vibe you'll get looking at their menu. Drinks:  I'm not one for drinking alcohol, so I'll skip this portion.  They only had wine, and no spirits.  I had a Black Cherry Soda for $4 (best part of the night) My Final Thought:  People don't go here to eat, and get FULL.  To me, when I was people watching, it was really more for socializing, since they were in Hollywood.  This place is definitely Hollywood'ed out.  If you like that kind of crap, then by all means, you'll love this place. The Bill:  The final bill came up to around $160, (tip included) divide that by 5 people, $32 bucks.  32 bucks and no way was I full, NOT EVEN CLOSE.  Do yourself a favor and go Canter's instead, it's about 500 feet away from Animal.  TERRIBLE place, OVERHYPED, OVER RATED, I don't know how this place gets so many great reviews.  I guess I just don't like to take it up the rear as far as paying for over priced food (with the exception of this review).

If you're a vegetarian you don't belong inside this restaurant (pretty obvious by the name). Make reservations at least three weeks in advance.  Its ridiculously crowded here. As others have said, Animal does not have a sign on its restaurant doors.  For those too lazy to plan ahead, Animal is located on Fairfax between Oakwood Ave. and Rosewood Ave.  I usually find street parking on Fairfax and maybe walk a few feet to save myself a couple bucks on parking. My friend and I came here to say goodbye to foie gras.  So we ordered the following: Chicken Liver Toast ($3):  It's a single piece of toast that is slathered generously with chicken liver (very creamy) topped with some balsamic jelly mixture on top.  If you like pate you should probably order this dish, plus it's the most affordable dish as well. Hamachi Tostada ($15):  It's a single tostada and it comes with herbs, fish sauce and peanuts.  It's really quite refreshing and light compared to the many other dishes served here.  I wanted to order this in particular, since my first visit to Animal they ran out.  If you like Thai food you will enjoy this dish.  There's a slight spicy kick to it as well. Poutine ($18):  This was my second favorite dish of the night.  The french fries are thin and crispy and come topped with oxtail gravy (and they're very generous with the oxtail) and cheddar.  It's a great dish to be shared and one for those who love french fries.  However, if you're sensitive to salt you probably don't want to order this dish, it was salty yet still delicious. Foie Gras Agnolotti ($18):  This was a foie gras goodbye dinner so we were intrigued by the liquid foie gras agnolotti.  Agnolotti is a type of ravioli.  I thought these would be pillows of foie gras deliciousness but it fell flat.  Just tasted like melted butter and had no real flavor.  I didn't even finish my portion of agnolotti and kept munching on the poutine. Foie Gras Loco Mococ ($35):  This was definitely the main event of the meal.  It's basically a twist on the Hawaiian entree which consists of rice topped with a hamburger patty, spam, foie gras covered in a type of gravy and topped with a  fried quail egg.  It was delicious and I wished Animal served this first so I could lick the plate clean.  I will miss you Foie Gras Loco Moco! Please also note that they will charge $0.20 per person for tap water.

Due to the CA foei gras ban, our waiter has recommended us to overlook our cholesterol level and overdose on foei gras. Indeed, the foei gras dishes we ordered - i.e. foei gras biscuit with maple sausage gravy and foei gras loco moco, were the best out of all the dishes we ordered. Yes, both dishes were extremely rich in flavor, but because of its rather modest portion, it didn't feel too much. Other dishes we liked were the chicken liver toast and the bone marrow. Dishes that disappointed us were the pig ear and the very charcoaled & burnt tandoori octopus. If you like Anthony Bourdain, you should definitely give it a go. He likes it :P

So glad we ate here before the ban - it was worth every calorie & dollar spent. Food so good, you outta slap your mama?! Yup, and your grandmama too. *eats* Everything was beyond melt in your mouth, flavor-filled, make you wanna close your eyes and say mmmm with every bite delicious. Seriously, no exaggeration, with the exception of the bacon chocolate bar which was meh for me. Of course the foie gras was the stars the show, esp since we came specifically to send these great dishes off. what we had.. foie gras mousse w veal tongue chicken fried sweetbreads, charred romaine, crawfish xo, creme fraiche foie gras buscuits & gravy - my absolute fave!! OMG I am going to miss this so! marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions foie gras loco moco bacon chocolate crunch bar w s&p ice cream *ambience* Simple, clean. I do wish that they had a mirror in the women's bathroom at a "petite height level," you know for us smaller women who want to check our teeth after a gargantuan dinner. It would be nice :) *service* Let me note how AWESOME the hostess was for kindly holding our reservation even though we were a bit late, and remembering us for noting how hard it was for my husband and I have a night off together to have some QT. Because of her thoughtfulness, we were able to be seated right away and enjoyed our dinner date from start to finish. I really cant gush about this place enough. I will definitely be back again, foie gras or not, the meals here are exceptional and def pushes the boundaries of uniquely delicious food.

I had to come to Animal before Foie Gras was banned in LA... Since everyone else in the city agrees with me, we came at 6 on the dot to snag a seat at the bar.  We had a wonderful personal experience with the sommelier and a little view into the kitchen, which I enjoyed Dishes we ordered: -Hamachi Tostada- wonderful light flavor! A little difficult to eat though, but delicious -Tandoori Octopus- Perfectly cooked octopus with wonderful sauces on the plate -Foie Gras Angalotti- Insanity!!!! Must order this, they just melt in your mouth -Chimichuri Bone Marrow with toast- wonderful bone marrow dish -Foie Gras Biscuit- incredibly rich, sweet, and decadent, love the seared foie -Foie Gras Loco Moco- this was really hardy and spectacular, i think there was some sriracha on the plate! -Pork belly slides- OMG these were incredible..... mushy buns with perfectly cooked pork -Rib Eye- this steak was covered with truffle parmesan sauce, and it was out of this world amazing -Beef Tendon Chips- they came with a delicious pho-flavored dipping sauce -Pate with jelly- this tasted like the best PBJ possible And, we did not neglect dessert! -Berries with Lavender cream and Basil- this was a wonderful light dish -Nectarines with brioche cake- really flavorful (i liked dipping the cake into the lavender cream of the other dessert!) the wine, atmosphere, and company was wonderful, and I can't urge you enough to go to Animal before Foi Gras is banned in July!!!!!

There are a many restaurants on my list to try. Animal has been on that list for quite sometime. However, being single its much harder to find someone to go with. This is where Yelp friends come to the rescue. I was finally able to try Animal when a group of us, including Laura S. and John H, decided to go! We wanted to try everything Foie Gras before it disappears in California. Parking ======== Parking is a little difficult. If you are luck you might be able to find street parking. Otherwise it is $5.50 for valet. I just used the valet. I'd rather not deal with hassle of driving around looking for a street spot. Service ======== The service was great. The staff was very nice and willing to answer any questions we may have had. Drinks were promptly refilled and place settings were reset halfway through the meal, as well as prior to dessert. Overall great service! According to Laura S. the wait staff is quite good looking. So ladies this is a plus for you guys! Ambiance =============== The restaurant is quite small. It is dimly lit and quite cozy. The noise level is not too bad. Not silent, but quite enough to have a conversation. I wouldn't say that this a a great place for a large party. Good for a date, or maybe 4 or 5 people. Any larger might be difficult. Food ========= The food was AMAZING! Absolutely loved everything we ordered. The food is served tapas style. I suggest ordering 2-3 dishes per person. We ordered an array of dishes (sans rabbit per Laura's request). We got the following: Entrees: ----------- chicken liver toast - Two pieces of toast spread with some type of berry preserve. marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions - Delicious! Melts in your mouth. pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg - Crispy fried pig ear with egg. A nice balance of tart(lime) and spice(chili). On of my favorite dishes. I have tried similar preparations at several other places. poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - Delicious Fries topped with cheddar and melt in your mouth oxtail gravy! Tasty! My only complaint was that the fries were a little too crispy for my taste. Maybe I should have let them soak in the gravy longer. duck breast, charred cabbage, liptauer, mustard - Nice juicy duck breast went well with the mustard and potatoes. foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger - One of their popular dishes! Definitely lives up to the hype. hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut - Nice and Fresh! A nice light dish. A great way to start off. It nice and clean. liquid foid gras agnolotti - The BEST dish of the night. Imagine little bites of ravioli filled with liquid heaven! Dessert: ----------- berries, vanilla custard, lavender crumble, opal basil - A nice combination of berries and sweet crumble. The lavender and opal basil add an interesting aromatic component to the dish. tres leches, dulce de leche - I loved tres leches. This was my favorite dessert. Moist but not overly soaked. bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream - Can't go wrong with bacon and chocolate. Bacon OR Chocolate can make anything better, but put them together and you have a great dish! nectarine, angle food cake - The extreme tart of the nectarine goes well to compliment the angle food cake. Overall, great meal! Awesome food and excellent company. Unfortunately foie gras is nearing its end here in California, so if you want to try any of those dishes you better get on it quick. The food is delicious in general, so even without foie gras I'd be interested in returning!

I think our waiter needs to get laid. A little uptight. Awww Mediocre. I've had similar fare at other restaurants and I left here a little bit underwhelmed. I've been wanting to eat here since March and just never got around to it until now. Met up with a few gf's and it was a nice place to gab. Not too loud. Very small, intimate type setting. They timed the bringing out of dishes nicely. Things we shared: OK: pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg 12 barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw 13 lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac 11 (It's just a salad) GOOD: tandoori octopus, tamarind, kumquat, raita 13 The first bite of octopus didn't impress me, that is until I ate it with a bit of tamarind/kumquat. It came alive. GREAT: hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut 15 The hamachi tostada had a great combination of flavors! Very vibrant, bright, and fresh.   DID NOT LIKE: melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread 12 berries, vanilla custard, lavender crumble, opal basil 7 The melted petit basque was my least favorite. It tasted like a layering of pizza components. Why? I didn't get this one. I was pretty full by dessert so went with the light berries and custard. I did not like the presentation. Liquid like custard spread on a plate and the toppings sprinkled over it. Was unimpressed with this dessert. DRESSY DRESS CODE? MORE LIKE WHAT DRESS CODE? These Asian girls come in in what looks like could've been pajama shorts, a hooded college sweater, and tennis shoes. Woow! JUST A NOTE: The check came and I signed for my portion which was $35. Got home and looked at my bank account....I was charged $42? I called and left a msg. Received a voicemail with apologies the next day as they said their machines charge inaccurate amounts initially, but it should end up only deducting $35 once pending status is complete. It was self corrected. I admit, I thought the "frustrated" waiter wanted more tip. I'm usually good at not jumping to conclusions. :/ There's no Animal sign posted. Just look for 433 address. Parking: Street or valet. I haven't had a problem finding street parking here yet. Might have to walk a block or so. Feels a little sketchy late at night so buddy up ladies.

It's all my fault, Animal. I blame myself. All of my friends love you, but I don't feel the same way. I think the biggest mistake we made was ordering too heavy. Animal has some mothereffing heavy dishes, but they also happen to be its most popular: Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy -- Staying true to my title as Force-Fed Geese Antichrist, I ordered both foie gras dishes. This was best dish of the night, and the main reason why I didn't give this place two stars. Foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger -- Separately, these are among two of my favorite things to eat. But when you combine the DNA of a white tiger with that of a unicorn, the result is a nightmare. According to my tongue, the same shit happened here. After several bites, we had to separate the foie gras and loco moco. Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar -- Like I said, we ordered too heavy. I thought I could handle it; but after a while, it was like getting punched in the mouth with a gravy fist followed by a roundhouse red meat kick to the gut. If I ever find myself back at Animal, I'll just order this alone and consume it with several glasses of Islay scotch. Lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac -- Thank God my girlfriend loves anything with beets, because we were THIS close to ordering the pig ear instead. It was the only light dish in a night of high digestive density. And if it weren't for this awesome salad, I'm pretty sure one of us would've ended up in a profoundly deep meat coma.

One of my new favorite restaurants. I've been wanting to try this place for possibly a decade.. finally trying it since foie gras is going to be banned in CA and I've always been wanting to try their Loco Moco. SO freaken satisfied after eating here... literally everything tasted amazing. Portions are pretty small, tapa style but us 4 girls were still pretty full from 7 dishes. 1. Chicken Liver Toast 2. Bone Marrow 3. Liquid Foie Gras 4. Foie Gras with buscuits and gravy 5. Foie Gras Loco Moco 6. Pork Belly Sliders 7. Steak Tried figuring out which was my favorite... pretty darn difficult since they were all pretty up on the list... Place is a bit small, make sure to call for reservations and they have valet. There's no sign outside so it might be hard to find.

This was definitely one of the BEST meals I've had (in comparison to other restaurants on Animal's level of cuisine)  My bf and I came here for our 1 year anniversary and it was definitely a day to remember, and a meal we'll always remember.   We ordered: 1) Marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions (5/5): the delicateness of the chimichurri not overpowering the soft marrow was absolutely mind boggling. I'd had marrow as a little girl in soups that my mom would make, but this was of a whole nother world.  It was rich, without being greasy, and flavorful without being overly salty. 2) Barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw (5/5): This has to one of the BEST pork belly sandwiches I've ever had, and I've had a LOT of fine pork belly in my life.  Up until this point, my favorite pork belly sandwich was located at Library Bar, the crunchiness and sweetness of their pork belly always left me wanting more, but Animals was very different. It was tender, SOOO TENDER, and beyond juicy.  The bun they used was perfect! Soaked up all the flavorful fatty juice that began dripping down and as you bit into it.  It was sweet, salty, hint of bbq, tender, did i mention juicy?? The slaw that's paired with it helps mellow out all the AMAZING flavors going on and really brings it all together. 3) Hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut (4/5): For a place called Animal, I felt a little weird ordering Sashimi hahaha But sushi is my #1 all time favorite thing to eat so I'll order it just about anywhere that serves it =] Not to my surprise, this was very tasty as well.  The hamachi was uber fresh and melted in my mouth.  The light vinaigrette was a perfect match that didn't cover up the freshness of the fish.   All in all, I would definitely recommend this place to any foodie out there!! My bf can be a pretty touch critic and even he couldn't stop raving about how delicious all 3 items we ordered were! (I've never heard him give 5 stars to every dish we order! thats says a lot!)

After months of anticipation, I finally dined here! The main reason was to eat foie gras for the last time before it's banned. Food: Animal definitely lives up to its hype. Being a tapas based menu, I ordered 5 items and tasted some of my friend's as well. Chicken Liver Toast: it was very good; I wouldn't mind ordering a couple plates of that Bone Marrow Chimichurri: This too was also good; Although, the Chimichurri is slightly overpowering but I didn't mind. It provided a lot of flavor while the marrow added the necessary richness. Foie Gras Biscuit and Maple Sausage Gravy: I'm not a fan of "biscuit and gravy", so I didn't like this dish all that much (mainly because of the combination... it just doesn't work for me). Overall, however, the dish was VERY tasty and EXTREMELY rich and heavy.... Eating this one solo is a bad idea, trust. SHARE WITH SOMEONE! Foie Gras Loco Moco: This dish was very interesting... but quite yummy. It was composed of hamburger, spam, foie gras, and topped with a quail egg... all surrounded with a pool of sriracha and teriyaki sauce. Flat Iron Steak with Truffle Parmesan: THIS was my favorite dish of the night. The cheese perfectly coated the steak (it was so sexy), and the flavors were spot on.  It also came with roasted potatoes and artichokes which were also good. Tres Leches: At this point, I was ready to knock out, but I did take a few bites from this dessert. It was very good, definitely one of the better Tres Leches that I've had in terms of flavor; however, the cake wasn't as moist as I imagine a Tres Leches to be. Ambiance: The place is veryyy small and extremely hard to find (luckily I went with someone who's been here before). Parking is a slight problem if you're not willing to valet, especially during peak hours. Service was good; wasn't fantastic but they were attentive. Reservation is still HIGHLY recommended, even though you'd be lucky if you get one within 5-31 days...

Every once in a while, a restaurant comes around that just changes the way you look and think about food. I call these my culinary epiphanies, and I had one at Animal. I called around 2pm for a same day reservation, of course I didn't get one but I was told to come in and get on the wait list. We got there around 6:30 and was told it would be 3 hours. We put our names on the list and went across the street to The Tavern and had a few drinks while we waited. Animal got us in about an hour and a half later. I would recommend 4-5 dishes for a party of two. For food we got: Foie gras Loco Moco Bone Marrow Hamachi tostada Pig ears Sweetbreads Veal tongue Food was top notch, as expected and totally worthy of the hype. I look forward to coming back here and trying all the other delicious items.

what a wonderful meal!! we made our second reservation during the dinner!! for sure it's not easy to get the reservation. The food was awesome but the restaurant is relatively small! the soft shell crab with egg was the best soft shell crab i have ever had!! the pork belly sandwich was a killer. the amount of sauce, the tenderness of the pork and the slaw, all went soooo well together!!   bone marrow was malt-in-your-mouth good and the deserts were superb also!!! Get 4 ppl to come so you can share more dishes!! I LOVE ANIMAL!!!

Went twice this weekend.  Drove by at 5:20 on Saturday and saw about 10 people in line, not too bad.  After grabbing a street spot and walking over 5 minutes later, there were 20 people in line.  Figured the wait would be hours with only 7 bar seats available, so came back Sunday even earlier and made sure we were first in line.  There are some interesting people hanging out in front of Supreme next door, but otherwise it was a chill wait. Of course once July 1 rolls around things will be back to normal, the hostess told me they have plenty of reservations available in July.  Everyone is trying to get one last taste of Animal's foie gras dishes before it's too late.   We ordered five dishes for our party of two.   foie gras biscuit  - oh so good, though the flavor of the foie does get masked a bit by the gravy.  but the gravy is damn good. oxtail poutine - fries were well done, and the oxtail was tasty.  pretty heavy dish though. pork belly sandwiches - it's hard to mess up pork belly, really, i thought the sauce was good with the right about of tang and the slaw was perfect.   foie loco - so good, so evil.  we all know the traditional LM in hawaii is already a gut bomb, adding foie to it is just over the top. the sriracha worked nicely with the rest of the plate as well. liquid foie gras tagliotti - this was a late add to our order, and so glad we did.  we were full but we justified it since we wouldn't be able to order it in another week.  pasta filled with foie liquid, sprinkled with fresh cracked pepper.  not overpowering, just right. Service was great, sitting at the bar is cool because everyone is usually pretty friendly and it's more of a communal dining experience... without the eating of each others' food.

Like many others, I had to come here before the foie gras ban was put in place!  I thought I had driven by before and saw a sign, but beware, it's pretty hidden.  I had to circle around a couple times before I found it.  It's basically right next to Canter's, so aim to park around that and you'll be fine.  Parking can be pretty tough and it's kind of sketchy back there (mostly because there aren't enough street lamps!), but it's doable. We ordered the chicken liver toast ($3), the foie gras loco moco ($36), veal tongue with foie gras ($14), and pig ear ($12).  My friend and I were both sick, but everything was pretty yummy!  Chicken liver toast is pretty tasty, especially for the price.  The veal tongue with foie gras mousse was delicious, and that mousse is pretty rich, so be careful. My only gripe with the rest of our dishes is, just like some others say, their dishes are too heavily spiced/sauced.  I get that they're trying to make eating weird animal parts seem like eating completely normal food, but it's to the point that it doesn't even seem like you're trying something adventurous.  For example, with the foie gras loco moco, so many flavors are presented and then they tell you to cut everything up and mix it all together, and in the end I didn't even get to taste if the foie gras was even good.  I don't even think I tasted it at all.  I felt the exact same about the pig ear.  The citrus flavor was so strong I felt like I was eating just any other type of meat. I definitely recommend trying Animal, but I just don't think it's everything it's hyped up to be.  After the foie ban though, I don't know if I will be coming back. this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.

Having trouble finding this place? I since there isn't any kind of sign but look for the Valet stand and the black awning. This is probably the most unique restaurant that I've had in LA.  Where can you go and get pig ears, sweatbreads and lamb brains all in the same meal?  The service here the 2 times I've come has always been very good and I appreciate that they bring the different dishes in rounds instead of one at a time or all at once.  Make sure to have a reservation though or you might be waiting for a while. Recommended: Chicken Liver toast - one of my favs esp for $3 Pork belly sliders Duck Breast Spring Rolls Foie Gras Terrine bone marrow ox tail poutine fries Decent: Tandori Octopus Yellow tail tostada balsamic ribs foie gras loco moco Quail bacon chocolate bar pig ears - i like the crispness but a little too sour Not Recommended: sweetbreads lamb brains

Oh yea, baby! Number 200 review goes to ANIMAL! Why it's taken me so long to try this place, I don't know but I apologize to the carnivorous foodie community in general. Let's get to the good stuff. SETTING: Located in LA, the land of no free parking, we actually managed to find some open street parking in the neighborhood just behind the restaurant less than 5 minutes walk away. No permits required so park and walk! The restaurant doesn't have a name sign outside, just a large plain black board. Yea, because they are so cool, they don't need a label. Psh. The interior has under 20 tables fit for 4 people each so huge parties, go away. The bar has a handful of first come, first serve seats so you can try there if you're brave and willing to breath down the necks of drunk diners to make them eat faster. FOOD: Delicious and innovative, I didn't love all their dishes but I sure would come back again at the drop of a hat. Anything foie gras was butter on my palatte. We had the foie gras loco moco which balanced ground meat, chunks of spam and that delicious foie gras. The bun was light and sweet, fluffy balance for my meaty madness. Bone marrow was small but tasted great with the bread as we scooped out ever little bit of creamed goodness. Chicken liver toast was a good starter, good for two people to share as they wait for the other dishes to come out. Everything here is almost tapa size so feel free to overindulge as you see fit. Considering the troubles of getting a reservation here, you might as well. Get the BBQ Pork Belly Sliders, they are so rich but well balanced, you don't even feel guilty about the fat. Pork ears were crisp, spicy, tangy and with that super lime kick- fabulous while hot. Break that egg baby, you know you wanna. Hamachi tostada was more of a meh for me, despite the recommendation of the server but I'm not complaining. K didn't let me order a whole order of everything foie gras though...guess I'll have to go back :] Dessert: Come on, do you have to ask? BACOOOOON SERVICE: Was decent, although I could have don't with some more explanations of dishes. They do serve food in the order of light to heavy which gives your palate something to work towards. They kept the water refilled and I loved that they constantly changed up the plates and utensils so you don't have to mix flavors. If you're trying to get a reservation and you can't get anyone to return your call, just keep calling. Wait every 15 minutes and call again. It's worth it, seriously. Overall, a strong meat restaurant geared towards those into the innovative and new, with fantastically depth in flavors and a terrible wait without a reservation. EAT THE FOIE GRAS WHILE YOU CAN!!!

Perfection. I recommend the Bone Marrow appetizer and the Flat Iron steak... I also had the Belgium Sour beer - VERY SOUR, super yum. The Bacon Chocolate was good, but I don't think I would get it again and the tres leches, while good, was nothing compared to the meals... perhaps just go with meats meats and all meats :)

I was skeptical about Animal, only because it had been built up in my mind by what I'd heard from others. So I tried to keep my expectations in check. But Animal came through with a really good meal. We shared a number of plates with our group. By far, the highlight for me was the least-expected. The grilled tandoori octopus was delicious. It was ordered by the bf, and I wouldn't have even considered it. But it was excellent. The texture was meaty and not chewy at all. The India-style spices were great. Definitely my favorite of the night. We all really enjoyed the balsamic-glazed ribs and chard. Very good. I loved the oxtail poutine--it was everything poutine should be.  None of us were wowed by the bone marrow, though the chimichurri was a tasty and interesting touch. Maybe I just don't enjoy marrow much.  The petit basque with chorizo was also melty, cheesy, goodness without being too overwhelming.   The bacon crunch bar left me cold--the bf didn't like it at all. I enjoyed the salt & pepper ice cream, but I think I'd have preferred just pepper. It was disappointing to not love the signature dessert, but memories of that octopus will keep me going. The beers we had were good, and service was good. We didn't have reservations, but we walked right in and sat at the bar (3 of us) for dinner without waiting.

Animal is a place where people fall in love. Just ask Drew Barrymore. And me! And even if you don't find your perfect match on a date here, you probably will fall in love with the food. Unless you just have no taste at all. My beau took me here for our first date, and after having so many bad dates, it was such a pleasant relief. He was the sous chef there at the time and even had a dessert item named after him that we, of course, ordered. Needless to say, the deal was sealed and the panties were droppin'. But anyway, about the food. The menu changes pretty often, but last I went the veal tongue dish was just wow, out of the park. It's pungent, sweet, salty, sour, just really perfectly balanced. Like really, really good corned beef or pastrami. The crowd-pleasing staples are the fried pig ear, pork belly sliders, oxtail poutine and foie gras moco loco. All delicious but heavy. I've also enjoyed the chicken liver toast, melted petite basque with chorizo, bone marrow with chimichurri, veal brains and rabbit loin. And the hamachi tostada. I found the bolognese a bit lacking in salt and in texture; one of our dining companions aptly described it as being like baby food. There was one other thing we had that didn't wow me but I can't remember what it was. But overall, I have a great fondness for this place as it serves delicious food with in-your-face flavors and is totally unpretentious and even suitable for "man dates." It's refreshing to see a place you can go to for a good meal where you needn't have a date to not feel out of place, and you can pretty much wear whatever you want there, as the proprietors and staff all have that rock star vibe going on. It's also open late on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, until 1 or 2? I've actually tried to block that fact from my memory, given that it caused me to suffer greatly as my boo wouldn't get home until 4 a.m. because of it. Restaurants that serve great food until the wee hours are awesome--until you start dating someone who works at one. Then you're like, who are all these assholes showing up for dinner at midnight? Why won't they fuck off? I hate them all! But personal theatrics aside, Animal is solidly delicious, a must-try if you've been asleep for the last couple of years and haven't yet been. I saw Chef Morimoto and Billy Corgan there on one visit!

This restaurant has been on my hit list for years and it was so worth the wait. This place is a foodie's dream. I legit woke up with a headache and what I would have to call a food hangover after eating here last night. My friend and I had our appetites and were ready to eat. We showed up really early for our reservation and were seated pretty quickly. The restaurant is small so I would say reservations are a must. They do not have a tasting menu but a bunch of their plates are small so its pretty easy to order a bunch and share. We ended up ordering and sharing 7 plates. We ordered a bottle of their house Cab which was $20. Great wine with some great food. Here is a run down of what we had. Hamachi Tostada - They give you just one tostada so let that be a warning to you. The hamachi was super fresh and super tasty. There were fried onions on top of it. The flavors just jumped out at you. Sweetbreads - If you haven't tried them before, dont be afraid. THey are like chicken nuggets. Great sauce with a little bite to it. Bone Marrow - One of my fav things. The chimchurri on top was on point. A bite of it on the bread was so buttery and delish. Just melted in your mouth. Poutine - The Oxtail gravy was TO DIE FOR. So rich, with a bunch of oxtail in there. I wish there were more cheese curds but it was so freaking good. The fries were perfectly crispy! Pig Ears - Thinly sliced and fried with a perfectly fried egg on top. Cut into the egg, mix it up and enjoy! I love a good runny egg. The ear was crispy and tasty. Not like I expected it to taste at all. Foie Gras Loco Moco - Super rich dish. The hamburger was so perfectly cooked. You got the Asian Hawaiian flavors in the sauce. This dish was device. The foie was so buttery. Def one of their larger dishes Fried Rabbit Legs - Two whole fried rabbit legs with some carrots to garnish. Fried perfectly and super crispy with juicy dark meat inside. If you have never had rabbit before this is a must try. Its basically like fried chicken. The staff runs the place so smoothly. All our plates were broken out so we never felt over whelmed with too much food on the table. There were even some people that pulled a dine and dash. Staffers tried to chase them down but no luck. But even with that, it never effected the flow of the restaurant. They kept it all under wraps. 5 stars all the way. Can't wait to try son of  a gun!

Yes, the prices are high for small-ish proportions, BUT you come here for the Experience! Where else can you have 5-8 different kinds of exotic meat in one single meal!? Each tapas has 1-3 different types of meat ranging from frog, lamb, ostrich, etc. All the mixtures seem crazy, but taste wonderful! I definitely recommend going here for a special occasion, with your carnivore loving friend! It's a small place, yet busy, so make sure to make a reservation and be prepared to have a glass of wine at the bar while you wait for your table.

With the impending foie gras ban looming, we made a point to dine at Animal before July 2012 rolls by. With about 15-20% of their menu containing this delicious ingredient, I hope that the chefs have other items ready to go when the time comes because that was the highlight of our meal. We did a little bit of research ahead of time and ordered: 1) Bone Marrow chimichurri (w/toast) 2) Foie Gras and Biscuit 3) Foie gras loco moco 4) Poutine w/oxtail gravy 5) Fried soft-shell crab (w/mexican sauce) 6) Chocolate bacon bar One of my disappointments began right away... things were just served out of order. The above is how I would think my meal should kind of progress. Instead, we received the bone marrow and fries last (not counting the dessert). As previously mentioned, the foie gras dishes stood as very rich and tasty. The spam in the loco moco added a tad bit too much salt for my taste, but was still very good overall. The Foie Gras biscut and gravy was by far my favorite of the night. The soft shell crab was also pretty good. The bone marrow, should have been our appetizer, but still felt okay in the middle. The Poutine was overly salty with the oxtail gravy. I was kind of disapointed in the dessert honestly though. While the salt & pepper ice cream made a perfect harmony with the bacon & chocolate, the size of the bar was just so miniscule that i sort of felt ripped off for $7. Another thing that didn't help was our waiter. While he wasn't rude, he wasn't exactly nice or friendly either. Considering that this is a hip Hollywood joint, I expect better. I don't recall him ever introducing himself nor bothering to check up on us during our meal. Instead I spoke to a busboy. And that's just kind of sad frankly. Finally, you MUST make a reservation to dine at a normal hour on a weekend. They don't do lunch which kinda sucks and valet parking is $5.50. In the end, I'm glad we went, but I'm not sure that I'd go back now that ban is about to take place. I will definitely want to check out their sister restaurant though.

The food was very rich. The drink menu was diverse. Hard to find--very unassuming building! We valet parked. We ended up arriving early and just eating at the bar. If you are a foodie, it's a must.

Looking for something new to try? Animal is one of those places you should go to if you're looking for something outside the box. I'm not too adventurous when it comes to eating different animals other than chicken, cow, and pig...and their body parts. Due to the impending statewide foie gras ban, my boyfriend took me here to try it. It was definitely an experience to remember! +Foie gras loco moco -- on my first bite I got a bit of everything in one bite. On the second, I took the foie gras out to taste it on its own. Wow! So buttery it melts in your mouth; I was finally able to get past the fact that I was eating duck liver. I've never had quail egg either...I'm not too sure what it tastes like on it's own since the thing was so tiny. The flavors of the dish were really good, I loved it! It left me wanting more...except for the price tag. +Foie gras agnolotti -- The filling is a liquid made with foie gras. So yes, don't bite into it, just eat it whole. Agnolotti is essentially a smaller ravioli that's native to a particular region in Italy. The dish was so flavorful! I didn't want to swallow because i wanted to keep the flavor in my mouth. There were only a few pieces too! Sighhhh...the dish was mocking me! You enjoy me, but you can't have more of me... +Pork belly sliders -- we were still a tad hungry after splitting the two dishes above, so we went with this. The flavor is again, off the hook. After two dishes of foie gras, this probably wasn't the best idea. The BBQ sauce was like a kick in your mouth; it was a bit of overload for me. It was still really good though; the pork belly was so tender. Warning: this is messy to eat. - The price tag. That's inevitable...the portions were such a tease. It is one of those restaurants that I'll come to every once in a while. -Parking: Good. Luck. Expect to circle around for a while, unless you get lucky. We parked down the street in public parking for $5. TIP: make a reservation and plan to arrive early to accommodate for the time it takes to find parking.

Aah, I finally popped the Animal cherry. And what better company can u have, than your brother's couple visiting from NY!? All the heavenly things I heard about. And Foie Gras, yes, heavenly Foie Gras aaahhh Well, So I got to have Chicken liver toast, marrow bone with chimichurri, pig ear, Foie gras biscuit, pork belly sliders, hamachi tostada, crispy rabbit legs, Foie gras loco moco, etc.. there was a lot more since we were a party of 4, but can't remember everything.. (can't believe it's already been a month since we've been here) So.. my overall verdict was, The stuff were good, but sometimes the food was too heavily flavored that I could not enjoy what I really wanted to enjoy, like marrow bone for example, all I could taste was chimichurri... pig ear, all I could taste was lime and chili, etc. But yes, you had me at the Foie Gras loco moco. Too bad we won't have Foie Gras anymore in Cali... bye bye

I'm not sure if it's because there is no more foie gras, but all the food we had was mediocre at best. I've honestly had better food for the same price. We ordered a few things that was suppose to be "favorites" the pork belly sandwich was a bit dry, these guys need to try using black pork if they didn't, if they did, then I'm sorry, you guys screwed it up. The quail did not not impress, not enough flavor. Bone Marrow was bleh, what's with all the chimichurri? can you say more bone marrow please? Their sister company, Son of a Gun, was definitely a notch above Animal. The staff at Animal was extremely friendly but I doubt i'll be going back.

Ate here with my hubby for our 17 wedding anniversary!  Hard to find restaurant in a not so good area.   Pros: great food... Loved the veal cakes- crunchy texture outside and creamy inside. Foie grois loco Moco was a hit and also the bone marrow with chimichurri Cons: parking ( unless you can squeeze into the spot for valet guys to drive your car elsewhere) bar area is very small and spills into dining area so get table away from bar. Also very small wait staff.... Hostess checked us in , served water and some of our dishes-great way to save on money I guess. Overall good experience and would go again

If you are not an Animal lover already, you will be after  your meal. Go in a big group, so you can try the variety that Animal has to offer.  Get the house wine.  You can't go wrong. Do get the foie gras torchon which comes with a blotch of blackberry jam.  How can you go wrong w/ poached foie gras?  Delicate and smooth.  Yummy with some toasted baguettes. Do ask for an extra plate of baguettes on the side.  The jam could be less sweet. For foie gras lovers, the veal tongue served with foie gras was equally tasty.  Who knew veal tongue tasted so bacony? The grilled quail was sweet and tender.  The rabbit legs were rather large in serving, and is accompanied with some pickled carrots and peas in a curry like sauce. The tandoori octopus was very tasty, served with kumquat and tamarind sauce. Hamachi tostada salad.  The fish sauce dressing tasted Thai or Vietnamese.  Light and refreshing, yet absolutely flavorful.  It's con-fusion food at its best. Chocolate bar with bits o' bacon.  EPIC.  chocolate and bacon.  Need I say more??! There were some rather weak dishes.  The bone marrow with caramelized onion was on the bland side.  Not much flavors.  Unfornately, the baguette had more taste.  Also disappointing were the chicken fried sweet bread.   The tres leches cake was mediocre and not moist enough.   Overall, casual and friendly ambience.  Attentive service.   Creative dishes.

Need to update my yelp with my reviews. I've def. slacked off the last year or two.. One of the first restaurants that pop into mind is ANIMAL. Friend and I rushed over because we were late for our reservation. The hostess graciously secured us another seating within minutes. The restaurant was pretty packed. A good mixed crowd. The menu is interesting. Similar to Sear Suckers from SD. (Ah, another review to update). I can't remember all that we ordered but I do remember ordering the sweetbread, foie gras and Pork ribs. Each bite was sweet and savory. *thumbs up* yum. fyi - sweetbread  = pancreas/thymus of a young animal...IT Is NOt "BREAD" as in FLOUR bread...haha . The friend that accompanied me to Animal made the mistake of ordering sweetbread at a prior animal encounter thinking that well, it'd be "sweetbread". When a plate of what looks like chicken popcorn came out he was confused lol Ps: Top ten restaurants in the US for yelp 2011. Animal comes in 10th place

A bit over-hyped for me but I didn't complain about anything I ate here. Tried to come here a couple other times but it was full tables until after 9pm. Chicken liver toast - YES please. a bit small on the portion Foie gras loco moco w/quail egg - DELICIOUS Soft shell crab - absolutely wonderful and crunchy. good medium size portion Foie gras biscuit - melts in your mouth Bone marrow - like butta We'll definitely come back. Love the ambiance with hip hop music. Staff was very nice as well.

Like so many others, my friends and I came to get our foie gras fix before the CA ban! We made reservations a week and a half in advance and still could only get a reservation art 10:15 PM. (We had a big group though). Animal is very minimalist. Dim, small, tables close together, not even a sign telling you that this restaurant is Animal. We arrived a little early, but we didn't get seated until 10 minutes past our reservation time even though the tables they gave us were already empty. They also squeezed a group of us at 2 2-person tables put together, so we were cramped. Our waiter acted a little snooty and uptight, so I really didn't have a good first impression of this place. Hate to admit, but since our dinner was so late, we actually caved and ate beforehand, so none of us were hungry. We still wanted to try things though, so we ordered: - Marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions ($10) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - Veal tongue, smoked foie gras, pastrami spices, crab apple ($14) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - Duck breast, charred cabbage, liptauer, mustard ($21) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy ($25) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - Foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger ($36) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - Bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream ($7) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) The food was FANTASTIC. Whatever disappointment I felt because of the service was made up by the food. My favorite was the foie gras biscuit with maple sausage gravy and the foie gras loco moco. The perfectly seared and fatty foie gras sitting atop a fluffly biscuit drowned in a sweet maple sausage gravy was so decadent. A little heavy, but so tasty! The loco moco was also really good. There seemed to be so much going on with this plate, but it was still tasty and the components came together! A little overpriced at $36, but still something great to try (in the next 2 days before the ban, that is). I really liked the duck breast too - it was tender and juicy, and the charred cabbage was cooked nicely without a bitter taste. The marrow bone was good too. I wasn't as big of a fan of the veal tongue or the bacon chocolate crunch bar, though they weren't bad. The veal tongue was okay, and the small bacon chocolate crunch bar is overrated. The bacon taste is subtle, but the salt not as much.   Still, I really enjoyed our dining experience despite the service. I would love to come back to try other dishes as the menu is constantly changing, but probably with a smaller group!

Loved this place!!!!! Had reservations at 9pm but the people before us were taking their sweet time and we didn't get sat until around 9:45p The manager kept us updated and gave us 2 free plates! All the food was great (I didn't like the coconut halibut but everyone else did) Definitely go for the house wine!

I lost count how many times I've been to this place, but every time I go, it never fails to remain consistent and excellent. The service is always great, servers are very attentive and friendly. Now, the food. The food is absolutely amazing.  I am SO sad about the foie gras ban in CA because this place has some really great foie gras dishes.  They have a Foie Gras Loco Moco, which was amazing.  I thought the foie taste would be covered by all the other items in the dish, but it was not and still had a great taste.  They also have a Smoked Foie Gras served with veal tongue.  This dish was a bit heavy, but so delicious.  Since all the dishes are shared, it ends up not being heavy at all.   Don't get me wrong though, this place has much more than just the foie dishes.  Some other dishes that are must haves are the Poutine, Hamachi Tostada, Bone Marrow and the BBQ Pork Belly Sandwiches.  All these dishes are so good.  It's so hard every time I go back, I want to try new things, but I also want to get what I know tastes good too! The only bad (but good for the restaurant) thing is that they are so busy, it can be difficult to get through when you call to make a reservation.  It's also hard to get reservations because the restaurant isn't huge and they are busy.  I would definitely suggest making a reservation, but it is so worth it!

This place was much smaller than I was expecting, and not a typical steakhouse as I was expecting. It was more of a fancy tapas place. The menu selection was very exotic and worth trying, but I don't feel the need to return ever again. I really don't like restaurants with crowded seating areas, so close the waiters have to brush you with their elbows every time they walk past. Also, the hostess was strangely rude and not very observant of the space restrictions around the restaurant.  We went to the bar to sit and wait for our table to be ready, but no sooner do we squeeze onto the only two seats at the bar that were open and the hostess comes up to us and says that we can't sit there because there is a waiting list to sit at the bar.  I told her ok.  And she just stood there looking at me like I was a bitch, waiting for us to move out of the seats.  But we were literally trapped in the space, and she was blocking the only space we had to slide the stools out of the way to move.  Did she expect me to slide my stool backwards into the diners sitting in the table less than 1 foot behind me? Did she expect my date to scoot his stool backwards onto her feet as she blocked our only exit from the bar space?  There was an awkward moment while she was staring me down and I actually had to say, "Yes, we understand and, we'll get out of the seats as soon as you back up and we actually have room to get out of them." It was like having to answer to a school Marm while she made sure that we relinquished the seats.

Oh my god.   Those are the words I said after trying each of the first 4 dishes.  Lived up to the hype and then some. I tried: Chicken Liver Toast-  Small Piece of toast.  Bomb! Bone Marrow w Chimichurri-  Never had bone marrow before, and it was awesome.  Fat + Flavor = Like Pork Belly Sliders- This was my favorite dish.  The pork belly melts in your mouth, and the texture of the coleslaw goes together perfectly in the slider. Quail w/ Bacon and Grits- Actually, this may have been my favorite dish.  Sooooo good.  Easily the best bacon, grits, and quail I've ever had.  Really, really good.  I think there was spinach on it too, which was also good. Soft shell crab- This was my least favorite thing.  It wasn't bad, but it was so heavy I couldn't really enjoy it that much.  Probably also because it was towards the end of the very, very heavy meal it was hard to eat.  Would have been nice if it were served first. Halibut- This was good, the fish was cooked perfectly. But like the soft shell crab, it was at the end of the meal, and the sauces in the halibut were heavy.  Not sure if this was just because of the culmination of rich sauces and flavors throughout the entire meal. Definitely will come back again.  This was a great and unique dining experience.  Even though I came after the foie gras ban, still worth going to!  You'll be hooked after the first bite.

Exotic meat dishes, I guess you can say. The server was a bit.. BLEH to us, but it's all good.. all the ingredients in each dish complimented the animal. Lol. Ordered: flat iron steak, balsamic pork ribs, melted petit basque, & hamachi tostada. NOM NOM NOMS. These dishes were share between two people and they were delish! I will be sure to try their dessert dishes next time!

Reservations are a MUST.  Heck, there's a line that forms outside the door just before opening time.  And take it from me, I've been a lot of places and feel comfortable in more places than most BUT you won't enjoy the surroundings of this restaurant as you wait outside. The bone marrow was just OK.  It's not some wonderful experience that I was hoping for. However, the bacon chocolate crunch w/ S & P ice cream is woth a visit (WITH RESERVATIONS).  You gotta try it.

All the rave about Animal was right, it did not disappoint! My dishes - Pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg ($12) Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy ($25) Barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw ($13) All these dishes were rich in flavor and fat! :) It was worth it! This is a great place for dinner but plan ahead; I booked my Saturday, 6pm dinner reservation one month in advance. Also, the place is hidden between shops so it's easily missed. Parking is not too bad; I parked in the residential area but it took a bit of a search. I'm definitely coming back to try more dishes on the menu!

Decided to celebrate the big 2-5 at Animal and man, if this is what I get for turning 25, I wish I could turn 25 everyday. On the real, this is my favorite restaurant in LA. They don't try to be all chic and posh, heck they don't even have a storefront. It's just all about good food and I can even argue that for what they're serving, the prices are really fair. And come on, $20 for the house wine? What a killer deal. I'm sure everyone knows what's on the Animal menu so I won't get into everything that we ordered (everything was bombalicious), but I can't help but rave about the foie gras biscuit. It is so rich, decadent, tasty, scrumptious, delectable... any kind of positive adjective you can think of works when describing this dish. It's, dare I say, perfect. Hands down my favorite dish in any restaurant I've been. I'm a bit curious on how they're going to replace the foie gras biscuit, but I wish they didn't have to. Oh well, enjoy it while you can people! Recommendation: foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy

This is my spot for indulging in the awesomest meals ever.  Everything is good, the service is awesome, and all in all it's a guaranteed great time. I'm pretty sad about the ban on foie gras about to take effect in California, because I'm a big fan of the dish (don't hate me!) and they do such miraculous things with it here.  The foie gras-biscuit-maple sausage gravy dish is my absolute favorite.  It's very salty and a little sweet at the same time, and the foie gras is prepared perfectly!  Other notables are the poutine with oxtail gravy (so decadent and DELISH), pig ear with chili, lime and fried egg (the chili lime combo with the pig ear is so yummy, and the pig ear is sliced nice and thin so it's not scary at all), and the hamachi tostada (light and refreshing - a good complement to many of the heavy dishes we usually order).   I've tried Son of a Gun too, but I think with all the meats involved at Animal, the flavors are much bolder and more memorable than at SOAG, where it's all lighter, fluffier seafood dishes.  Both are must dos, but this one takes the cake for me!  Reservations in advance are a must - the place seems to be always packed.

YUM! The dishes were really unique, simple and delicious. I have been twice, and have sampled a variety of items: buffalo pig tails--I did not think I would like these as much as I did. A really fun play on buffalo wings, but even better because of the fried pig skin element. Balsamic pork ribs--super meaty, and they really got the texture right--tender without being too fall-off-the-bone. Just like a good rib ought to be. The sauce was sticky and sort of reminded me of chinese hoisin ribs. kale salad with asiago and lemon vinagarette--my mouth waters just thinking about it. the bitter kale with the sweet, nutty cheese and tangy vinagarette with a little zip from chili flakes is a perfectly balanced dish. basque and chorizo with crostini. WOW. All I have to say about that. Absolutely divine gooey, cheesy heaven. Rabbit spring rolls: light and fresh with rare, seared rabbit. Oxtail poutine: we got this too close to the end of the meal--it was so rich, and I was overly full, so I could only have a bite. the gravy with the tender, fatty oxtail and cheese curds were so good, though! I think this is one of their more substantial dishes--a pile of fries with a healthy serving of rich oxtail gravy and tangy cheese curds. If you are worried about being hungry because of the petitie portions, fill up on this! Foie gras biscuit and gravy: it's like a savory dessert--creamy, sweet/salty and mapley. We split it amongst 4, and it was just one bite for each of us--it is so rich, that's all you need. Surprisingly, I didn't love the chocolate bacon bar. Perhaps because I was disgustingly full?

***The bold (sometimes too bold) flavors at Animal make it less distinct and sophisticated than Ink, but Animal's approach to meat (many different proteins featured) and the strong skill the kitchen shows with cooking meat make it one of LA's best and most unique restaurants*** Animal features a fairly large menu and there is definitely a showcase for meat--many different proteins, many different cuts.  And the chefs Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo do a great job cooking those meats--they are prepared with near perfection (consistently flavorful, moist and tender).  The overall flavors of the plates tend to be bold here and sauces are often noticeably sweet, salty and/or tangy (though maybe not unique). The food at Animal reminds me a lot of Ink.  Both specialize in flavorful small plates that often feature more rustic cuts.   I prefer Ink.  The presentations are nicer though I think Animal has really upped its game in this area since my first visit.  The food at Ink though is also more creative and unique.  The kitchen shows a little more restraint in the saucing and such, which results in more distinct and memorable flavors (there is also more attention paid to flavor and texture combinations, which leaves a more lasting impression). The food at Animal is still very good and among the best in LA.  We had several things on this visit and here is the rundown. (Grilled quail, rhubarb, grapes, cucumber) I really liked the quail; it had a good smoky flavor and the meat was juicy and tender.  The sides were fresh and light. (Duck breast, charred cabbage, liptauer, mustard) They did a good job with the duck breast here--crispy skin, tender meat and a good flavor.  The charred cabbage was also good--tender and not bitter. (Hamachi sashimi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut) This is a good go-to dish because it is lighter than the other plates even though there is no sacrifice in flavor.  The textures are great from the crispy tostada to the crunch of the cabbage.  The saucing was too strong here with the vinaigrette; the hamachi was soft and fresh. (Crispy rabbit legs, carrots, peas, mustard sauce) These were good (and a big portion).  I was worried that they were going to be greasy, but they were not (crispy outside and a tender inside; also not that dry).  The side vegetables were also good and nicely cooked. (Tandoori octopus, tamarind, kumquat) The octopus was nicely cooked--very soft.  I wish the flavors of the kumquats stood out more.  The tamarind was very strong and somewhat overpowering. (Balsamic pork ribs, mache, beet and crouton salad) The ribs were big and very tender, juicy and meaty.  The balsamic sauce gave it a more distinct BBQ sauce (not as sweet as some BBQ sauces or as vinegary as BBQ sauces you will find in the Midwest).  The salad was fresh and light. (Bone marrow, chimichurri, caramelized onions, toast) I am not a huge fan of bone marrow because of the fattiness and the bone marrow here was definitely fatty.  The saucing was great though.  I really liked the caramelized onions, which gave the bone marrow a sweeter and more appetizing flavor. (Chicken fried sweetbreads, prawns, xo sauce, charred romaine) I liked the prawns as well as the hot and spicy sauce.  The charred romaine was also good--warm and with a nice flavor.  I was not a big fan of the sweetbreads because they were too small.  The great contrast between the meatiness and fattiness of the sweetbread was lost here. (Melted petit basque, chorizo, onions, grilled bread) This was one of the more average dishes of the night.  The cheese was good as was the chorizo, but this felt like something you could easily find elsewhere; it was also a tad greasy. We had three desserts and none were that impressive.  The tres leches cake was good but very simple.  The bacon chocolate crunch bar was better than I remember, but it was a very small portion; it did come with a salty and creamy s&p ice cream.  The last dessert, which consisted of berries and vanilla custard was really standard stuff (and the portion of custard was too small). Service was personable though some of the plates took a while to come out.  Still, waits between courses were not too bad. Prices are not that high. Smaller plates are in the $15 range while larger plates go mostly from the mid $20s to the high $20s.  Animal is definitely a place where you can try a good variety of food without having to spend too much (though some portion sizes are small). The food at Animal is very good and the wide variety of proteins used (as well as the cuts used) give Animal a unique advantage over many other small plates restaurants.  If you are looking for some of the best food in LA, you should definitely consider giving Animal a try. Parking is available on the street by meter.

One of the best meals of my life. Came here the day before my bday, and could not have had a better birthday dinner.   If you are not an adventurous eater, this is NOT the place for you. If you are, then this is the place you have always dreamed of.   I have been wanting to come to animal for some time and have never gotten over there, they are only open for dinner after 6pm.   I got here around 10:15 PM and they said there was a 40 minute wait!!! I was amazed that they were this crowded at 10 at night on a Tuesday, but figured it must be as good as I had been expecting.  Was told that my party must be seated by 10:45 or TS....damn I get a call around 10:35 that said my table was being cleared and to head on into the restaurant in 5 minutes...SUCCESS.   The first thing we ordered was the crispy beef tendon.  This was similar to a chicharrone, crispy, deep fried beef tendon served with a cool, pho dip.  This was a very good appetizer for our meal and had all of the elements present of a Vietnamese pho soup, but much different than anything I had previously ever experienced.   Next up was fried pig tails, prepared buffalo style.  This was the dish I was most nervous about trying, never thought pig tails could taste good much less be delicious.  I can honestly say I may like pig tails prepared this way better than hot wings...which are my all time favorite food.  They were crispy, juicy, with a bacon, porky flavor and all of the other flavors of regular hot wings.  How can you go wrong there? Main course was the reason I wanted to come here in the first place.  Foie gras biscuits and gravy.  Sadly, foie gras will be illegal as of the 1st of july, so anybody that likes foie gras, I strongly encourage you to go and get this dish.  Butter bicuit, maple sausage gravy and a juicy, fatty piece of foie gras placed on top.  This may have been the greatest flavor combination of ALL TIME.  Absolutely amazing, decadent and rich.   Finally, we finished off the meal of a lifetime with their famous bacon crunch bar with S&P ice cream.  What is S&P ice cream you ask?  Salt and Pepper of course...lol because I saw that coming too.  Every flavor combination together made for a magnificent ending to an incredible meal I can not wait to come back to.

Thought I'd swing by "Animal" before the eminent foie gras ban.  Just to be clear, I'm rating this 4-stars for their technique and creativity.  As something of fine dining techniques married to ghetto-casual style, "Animal" is pretty unique.  I definitely prefer this place to their sister restaurant, "Son of a Gun."  However, not all the flavors are for me.  You get the pretty hostess (damn she was fine... loveliness that is beyond this existential plane), service, haute cuisine portions and prices, but in the setting equivalent to a garbage lid.  Okay, maybe not that ghetto, but across the street from the ghetto.   One thing first, unless you're adventurous, skip dessert.  I wasn't really loving the desserts at Son of a Gun, and it's the same here.  I chose between the bacon chocolate bar with Salt & Pepper ice cream, and the Berries with lavender crumble.  The latter won out; mainly 'cause I've had something similar to the former before (at Providence).  Salt & Pepper ice cream alone is a unique taste, so if you've never had it before, by all means try it.  But after you've had it, I'm sure you'll think whether if you'd really prefer it to black raspberry jasmine ice cream or cookies 'n cream. The Berries in vanilla custard with lavender crumble is plated like a modern art masterpiece. That means, you're not sure whether to call it pretty or ugly; but it does captivate you. And it seems like half the dishes at Animal are plated that way:  like a Jackson Pollock painting.  The dessert itself, the berries are fresh, but there's so little of the crunchy lavender crumble that it's hardly satisfying.  Thumbs down. Okay, positives:  their house cab sauv is a decent deal at $20 a bottle.  It has mellow tannins, and a fruitfowardness that's easy to drink and accessible to the average person.   Right off the bat, I'll tell you the winning dishes with me were the veal tongue with foie gras, pork belly sliders, and the fried pig ears.  I felt the veal tongue, in pastrami spice and smoked foie gras had the most elegance as far as marrying the flavor components.  Rich, robust smokiness, to tender and a slight sweet finish. Pork belly sliders are very straight forward, and they are straight forwardly delicious. The tenderness of the pork belly rivals top ramen shops where the pork is so tender, lifting it would have it pulled apart from sheer gravity.   The chimichurri bone marrow is a decent play.  Although, you're only getting half a bone for one serving.  Most places like Pizzeria Mozza or Morimoto will give you two halfs of a bone, but not here.  I could've done without the sweetness of caramelized onions, but I can see how most palates could dig it with the punchiness of chimichurri.  The thick brick toast is a pleasant foil for the flavors, crisp yet soft in texture, and able to mellow out the strength of the dish. As for the pig ears, this tasted for Southeast Asian.  Like for me, Isan-cuisine in Thailand, where it's spicy, limey, with egg yolk to mellow out the heat.  I know they can get away with it here (because it's a trendy spot in LA), but they're charging a premium for something that should essentially be a bargain food binge. I felt similarly so to the chicken liver toast.  It's executed well, but the chicken liver pate is something of a Vietnamese bargain type too, for banh mi sandwiches. Foie Gras Loco Moco... so many people rave about this dish.  To me... yes, it's tasty, but it's not $35 tasty.  A good Hawaiian loco moco should run $6, so does technique and foie gras make deserving of such a premium?  I'm not amazed by the use of Sriracha (would you? If they used Tabasco, Tapatio, or Red Rooster in its place?)  Call me spoiled by the likes of Matsuhisa and Melisse, but for chefs that challenged "The Iron Chef Hottie Cat Cora,"  I was hoping for something that could take on such level of inventiveness.   The crispy rabbit leg with chermoula sauce... if you like chermoula sauce, give it a shot.  If you value a lean lean protein capable of inducing mal de caribou (rabbit starvation/protein poisoning), give it a shot.  Beyond the exotic factor and the price, it won't taste any better than chicken.  Honestly.  Unless YOU'RE the sweet genius with the golden tongue. Last dish that was just so-so, Chicken fried sweet bread, charred romaine, and crawfish.  Yeah... it was just okay. Hardly filling, and the taste... you can buy a bottle of sweet chili chicken sauce from the Thai supermarket.  The breading on the chicken is nice, and the romaine is charred tastefully.  Yeah, that romaine, I think that was the most memorable part of the dish for me. I'd come back at least one more time to try some of their other creations.  I obviously don't like everything I had, but I guess I kinda of think of Animal as hit-or-miss art for the senses.

Wow. Just wow. My girlfriend and I went here after much anticipation - and I can definitely say it deserves the hype. In fact, it even surpassed my lofty expectations. It was one of the most delicious meals I have ever had...and I've been to some excellent restaurants in my time. Managed to get in here before the foie gras ban in CA. I don't even usually like foie gras, but here, it's a different story. Heaven. Everything. Was Heaven. The bone marrow. Yum. The foie gras loco moco. Wow. The foie gras agnolottie - OH MY GOD. This was a joke. I think this might cure some diseases. It's that good. The pork belly - savory and amazing. I had about 10 other courses I can't even remember, but they were all great. If you are a carnivore, you owe it to yourself to go here and gorge.

Where to begin......Well first and foremost food is not bad per se, but it's overhyped grossly overhyped. Which duh I should have guessed as is the case with most overly reviewed joints (case in point Roscoe's b/c unless you have an injury that permanently deprived you of your ability to taste that place is bland and gross) . Anyway back to ANIMAL..... Service: 5 stars our server, his name escapes me, shaved hair, tattoos, totally nice. From the host to the people that bring your water and clear your plates service was attentive. The kitchen was kinda slow and even though we had reservations and got their 5 minutes early we waited half an hour to sit and didnt get our first plate until an HOUR after our reservation time. The food: I'll break it down for you. The good: Chocolate bacon crunch bar 4 stars. The S&P ice cream it came with 5 stars. Now its NOT bacon-y its actually quite dark chocolatey, like higher cacao content than I expected.  Rich but not milk chocolate overly sweet rich.   The Bad:Balsamic pork ribs. 3 Stars. Big portion but it was a throw away dish like they needed to put something on the menu non adventurous people would order (aka my bf). The vinegar was waaaay too pungent and the herbs it came with and lemon oil dressing tasted like potpourri. The Ugly: Buffalo pig tails. WTF I could get that at any Mexican market with less fat and not use franks red hot sauce and have made a better pig tail dish. Suuuuuper disgusting inedible Everything in between (which is the majority of other stuff hence just ok food) The pork belly sandwiches: Good, actually pretty good but so unspecial I had to go back and add this to my review b/c I forgot we had had them. Probably the best salty dish we had. Veal tongue with foie gras: As one yelper put it....tasted of ball park franks. Thats a pretty good description. It wasnt bad hot dogs but definitely deli meat not phenomenal pastrami. I liked that it was pink and thinly sliced really reminded me I was eating a veal tongue ;) Last but not least the Foie gras with Maple gravy and biscuit. Mieh. I cant say Foie adds anything more than texture and fat to a dish. The gravy was the best part of the dish. Wont be terribly sad in July when it's gone. It's a replaceable texture and overly rich. That said it's soooooo rich if you're not used to ingesting a ton of fat you will feel f*cking disgusting afterward....and instantly sick like an hour later.....that'll teach me to indulge in baby cow and over fed duck liver(kidding cows are yummy and meant to be eaten definitely not a vegetarian  vegan crazy hippie) but this place was probably a bit much. It's an eh in my book. But I'm glad I scratched it off my bucket list.

As stated from my review of Son of a Gun this is an EXCELLENT establishment! I just had my first meal here last night and I can still taste the Ox Tail Poutine with White Cheddar Cheese in my mouth...I have become like Pavlov's Dog's now and I salivate at the very thought of that dish! I was surprised, however that they didn't have any kind of cocktail list, which is odd because your name is ANIMAL so you gotta go crazy right? Ahh I digress. I also have the Beef Heart (a first for me) and the Pig's Ear ( also a first..I think but who knows with the amount of hot dog's I ate growing up). Everything I had was  both delicious and delightful as was our servers...well the delightful part any way. I would highly recommend this place for that carnivore in you. Check it out the next time you decide to not try Canter's on Fairfax as it is right next door! Highly recommended! It is also highly rich food so be advised...you may need a Prilosec prior to your meal, if like me you have a touchy stomach!

The small portions means you basically have a menu of $10-$39 appetizers. We left the restaurant still somewhat hungry after 5 dishes (+1 dessert). My boyfriend and I shared, from great to okay: * pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg $12 - We both mopped it up, really good flavors and, other than the chicken liver toast, the best deal. Animal's definitely got it figured out - a fried egg with the delicious yolk ready to burst is pretty much one of the best ways to enhance any meal. * chicken liver toast $3 - I would order one per person, since they're too delicious to cut in half and share. Good value compared to the other dishes here, but sort of expensive for what it is. * 11.11.11 stone vertical epic ale $26 (drink) - Pretty hoppy with just the right amount of depth and darkness to it. This was the most expensive thing we ordered... yikes. * berries, vanilla custard, lavender crumble, opal basil $7 (dessert) - Tiny dessert with big flavors. * tandoori octopus, tamarind, kumquat, raita $13 - Good somewhat-Indian dish - we really loved the raita sauce. The octopus wasn't hard or too dry. * foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy $25 - We probably should have ordered foie gras loco moco, but we've had mediocre experiences with foie gras+burger combos before so we opted for this instead. It's not the top foie gras preparation we've had, by far. I love biscuit and gravy so I enjoyed it, but my boyfriend was exceedingly underwhelmed. Photos of this dish are deceiving in terms of the size of the dish; my brain normalized the size of the dish by thinking that the biscuit is normal sized; note: in the photos, the biscuit you see is a mini-biscuit. Adjust your expectations accordingly. * marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions $10 - I still don't know what marrow bone tastes like after this dish, though the chimichurri/caramelized onions flavor was good. I'd like to come back and try some other dishes in the future. My boyfriend wasn't satisfied with this meal so he won't be coming back.

I was really excited to eat here since reservations seemed hard to get.   We arrived 10 minutes early for our reservations and still had to wait 20 minutes outside.   We ordered the hamachi tostada, crusted tilapia, veal tongue and foie gras, and foies gras biscuits and gravy.   Everything was so rich!  My heart was hurting as I was eating, and at the end, I was screaming Uncle.  Total first world problem..."I have too much foie gras, I can't finish it all".   We asked for some bread to try to even out the richness of the other dishes, but all they had was super buttered/grilled brioche.   The food was decent, but I've had a lot better for the price and hassle.  Nothing stood out as "wow!".   The restaurant was loud and we had to keep flagging down the waiter because we were never checked on.   Total for the bill for 2 people was $220.

First of all, I must say I actually love this restaurant. Based on food, service and foie gras, it should be rated 5 STARS! But, unfortunately, due to the reservation process, I have to take away a star.  And, I'm not sure if it is because of the impending foie gras ban, but it has been particularly bad this month. They are not on http://Opentable.com. When you call the phone number it tells you to call between 2pm and 10pm to make reservations. If you are calling between those hours and you've reached the machine, your choices are to leave a message or call back later. Well, I've left a message and never received a call back. So, now, I just keep calling until I get a live person.  And, when I do get a live person it's usually during dinner hours when it is VERY loud and she can't hear me and I can't hear her and I am inevitably placed on hold.  There's got to be a better way to do this. I've eaten here about five times and I have enjoyed every dish (all the foie gras, the pig ears, the pork belly sandwiches, etc) that I've ordered. They are worthy of all the glowing reviews so I still encourage everyone to try it!

Holy balls, batman! The food here is so f'n tasty.  My fav-o-rite may have been the duck and of course the foie gras biscuit. My rule is: If you smother sausage gravy on that shit-- it belongs in my mouth.  YEAAAA!!! One star taken off because it was too cold in the room and I had to stare at a man with his shirt unbuttoned to his navel the entire time.  The worst part was when he got some kind of sauce on his chest hairs.

This place is fucking dangerous. It's kinda like tapas style and everything you order they send it out in a progressing order to please your condescending palette. It's no wonder master chefs eat here. Get there early because they fill up fast. Don't go in acting like a super cool LA dip shit. This place is meant for hardcore motherfuckers that crave delicious hand crafted food. chew more than usual to savor every bite.

Stunning meal.  Rabbit Sausage and shrimp spring roll, foie gras with maple sausage gravy, and fried pig ear. Does it get any better? I came here at the recommendation of good friends in Las Vegas, and I thank them so much for recommending the place. I started with the shrimp and rabbit sausage spring roll.  It was served with small eggplant slices, sprouts, and some green curry.  There was a good amount of shrimp in each section of the roll and the rabbit sausage added to the flavor.   Next up was the foie gras on a biscuit surrounded by maple sausage gravy.  Unbelievably good!  I don't think I've ever seen a piece of foie gras that large.   For the final plate, I got the fried pig ear with chili, lime, and fried egg.  You break the yolk and mix it with the pig ear for extra flavor.  Just delightful. Dessert was their famous bacon chocolate crunch bar with salt and pepper ice cream.  What a great ending to an excellent meal.  I'd like to have had a cholesterol reading this morning. The staff was great!!  My server was Salomon and he was helpful in suggesting that for one person I should stay with ordering two dishes and then see where my thoughts were at that point.  I had checked their menu online and I knew I wanted the foie gras.  The spring roll was a spur of the moment thing.   Salomon saw to it that the timing of the dishes was excellent.  There was little wait from the first order, but there was an appropriate pause between the dishes.  After the first two, I still wanted more so I ordered the pig ear.  Then dessert. What more can you say?  This is a place that has to be tried!  Extraordinarily imagined and prepared food. Thanks, Candace and August!

Connoisseurs of the "Tasty Bits" rejoice! You name it, they've probably served it. Pork Cheek Bone Marrow Duck Liver Thymus Glands Beef Tongue Rabbit Legs Brain Tendons If going out to order Steak and Potatoes with a  side of the "chunky" Horseradish is your idea of living on edge, then let me stop you from spending an hour shifting around in your seat uncomfortably while the Waiter explains that yes this IS the menu and not a study list for Veterinary school. If however you ARE part of the enlightened among us that can read through the stated list without batting an eye, then congratulations are in order because you are about to experience a meal the likes of which will wake you up in the dead of the night drooling and reaching for that ethereal plate of Foie Gras and Biscuits. Animal takes VERY seriously the fact that before one can ingest an item of food, they must first devour it with their eyes. The Hamachi tostada is a perfect example of how gorgeous a plate can look when the skilled hands of an artisan meets the nuance of an artist. Gorgeous. ...and yes the dishes are more than a pretty plate. Take a bite of anything off the menu and even if you don't notice how each dish seamlessly walks you through several layers of texture, the flavor profiles will knock even the most bull-headed of foodies onto their ass. To make the most out of the Tapas-style experience, head over with a couple of your friends because each dish (modestly priced) holds enough for a table to savor a couple of bites before the next course arrives.

I give this place credit for turning even the most unusual of animal parts into tasty eats and the more familiar animal parts into delectable dishes. Then when you factor in the restaurant's eye for presentation and excellent service, you'll find yourself sitting down to a fantastic meal. Chicken Liver Toast - Such a simple and ordinary looking dish, but it was a flavor bomb of rich liver and balsamic reduction of shallots. Definitely a gotta-try dish imo and at only $3 a pop. Veal Tongue, Smoked Foie Gras, Pastrami Spices, Crab Apple - Gorgeous looking dish, tasted great too. Salty/sweet lovers will enjoy this dish. Balsamic Pork Ribs, Braised Greens, Chili Oil, Garlic - WOW. The meat just slid right off the bone with hardly any pressure from my fork. You'll definitely get a little messy eating this one, but worth it. I can't say the same about the braised greens though. The greens still had an acrid bite to them and made them too gross to eat. Foie Gras Loco Moco, Quail Egg, Spam, Hamburger - That's right, it's 2012 and Animal still serves foie gras! (I want to feel bad for the duck and geese but foie gras is just too delicious!!) It's really good, but it's one of those dishes I'd recommend sharing since it's too rich and heavy for one person to devour alone. Pig Ear, Chili, Lime, Fried Egg - Awesome combination of flavors and textures--sweet, spicy, sour, soft runny egg and crispy pig ears.  It was my first time eating pig ears, and I didn't feel freaked out about it because they chopped the pig ears into thin slices and deep fried it to crisp it up. The dish really reminds me of a gourmet version of chili lime Taki chips. Barbeque Pork Belly Sandwiches, Slaw - MMM. Another must order. The tasty slaw.. The melt in your mouth slabs of pork belly slathered with bbq sauce in a toasty bun. Are you salivating yet? You should be... Tres Leches, Dulce De Leche - Its exactly what you expect in a tres leches. Moist, rich, delicious. Perfect way to end a great meal. Great food, great experience! Will definitely love to dine here again sometime.

Although I had very high hopes and I anticipated my meal here for months, Animal was a big disappointment to me. I am a big lover of chef-driven, farm-to-table, and progressive restaurants. An example of this is my love for a restaurant much like Animal. That place is Barley Swine in Austin, TX (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) My biggest gripe with Animal is that their flavors and combinations did not work. Their technique was impeccable, but the flavors were a big let down. The prime example of this was the pig ear dish with a fried egg. The ears were cooked to crispy perfection. However it was way too sour. Too much lime or vinegar. The egg was cooked perfectly. I understand that the rich egg yolk was supposed to tone down the acidity, but the sour flavor was too much to over come. The 3 of us at the table took a bite and all did the pucker face all at once. Or, for your 3rd Bass fans...we gave the pig ear dish the Gas Face. Next example is the Pork Belly BBQ sandwich. The Pork Belly was so tender and cooked to perfection. The BBQ sauce ruined whatever enjoyment I took in the belly's preparation. The BBQ sauce reminded me of Kraft BBQ sauce. It was so sweet and smoky that it just turned the pork belly into bacon. I am all for transforming the flavor of pork belly, but making pork belly taste like bacon is a very underwhelming and uninspiring transformation. Exhibit C: Chicken Liver mousse toast. $3 for one small piece of toast with chicken liver and topped with caramelized onions. That is a pretty impressive profit margin. The chicken liver mousse was superb. However the sweetness of the onions just overpowered the taste of the expertly prepared mousse. Chicken liver mousse's richness is best paired  with a brighter complimentary flavor. My friend tried chicken liver mousse for the first time and he liked it...only because all he tasted was caramelized onions. The next disappointment was the beef heart with scallion pancakes. Again, the beef heart was cooked great. But the combination of Chinese hot mustard and hoisin sauces overpowered the beefy-umami goodness of beef heart. If the dish was not over-sauced I would have liked this dish more. The dishes we did enjoy were the beef tendon chips, tandoori octopus, and veal tongue with foie gras mousse. The beef tendon chips were the most impressive. They do some molecular gastronomy by dehydrating beef tendons, re-hydrating them, then molding them into a chip, then dehydrating them again then frying them to a perfect chicharron-like crisp. It was paired with a pho dip that tasted just like the soup. The octopus was the best cooked I have ever had. Not tough or chewy or too tender. The octopus was al dente and lovely. The Indian tandoori flavor was spot on, but this dish was way too small. I think there were 4 bites of octopus for $15. The veal tongue was great. They transformed tongue into something that tasted like Filipino tocino. I wish they would have given us more tongue pieces because the ratio of small tongue pieces to huge ice cream scoop of foie gras mousse did not match. For great technique, but bad flavor profiles I was going to give Animal 3 stars. The next star comes off for service and drink. In a chef driven progressive place like this, the staff is supposed to present the plate to the table and then describe each component of the dish. Our server tried each time to just drop off the plates and keep going. I had to stop the server every time and ask what the dish and the components were. It made the staff look impersonal and incompetent. Was it because we were "just " a table of 3 dudes? No matter the reason, service was also a disappointment. Next drinks....Holy shit.....$10 for a can of shitty LA IPA, $8 for a 12oz. bottle of Rogue Dead guy. We paid $36 (PLUS TAX TIP) for 4 beers! You try that crap in Portland and we will burn your place down. I understand the price point of the food. It corresponds to what they are attempting and the quality they produce. Your food prices shouldn't dictate your beer prices. Just because you have high priced fancy foods that doesn't mean you rape me for the price of a beer. I can't see any reason why I would give Animal another chance. It will be interesting to see if the rabid loyalty and/or curiosity will continue after the foie gras ban.

One of the top restaurants in LA easily. Have been many times now. Had the bone marrow last week for the first time and it was great. The balsamic pork ribs are unreal too. EVERYTHING I've eaten here has been top notch. The Tres Leches might be the best dessert in the city.

Okay YELP, we are back after a year hiatus!  I couldn't think of a better start than finally making the first long awaited trip to ANIMAL!  Valet parking is directly in front with easy access so no point messing around trying to land that rare curb spot 3 blocks away.  We ordered the chicken liver toast, chimichurri bone marrow, heirloom melon and crab salad, pig ear w/ chili lime & egg, porcini & corn agnolotti, and a couple of seasonal fruit desserts to top off the experience.  Everything was great but some dishes stood out above others.  The pig ear w/ chili, lime, & egg was my favorite and i almost ordered another!  Imagine the perfect plate of crispy pork, spicy chili, and fresh lime that you crack an oozing egg yolk all over and combine; i hope this stays on the menu during their usual rotations!  The porcini & corn agnolotti was like little pillows of creamy sweetness that reminded me of that euphoric experience i was hoping for at Din Tai Fung; this was a prefect lil dumpling/ravioli!!!  Less than 1 mile from The Grove and lots of trendy shops and activities to walk off the food coma or kill time between a lunch and dinner experience :)  Will definitely be back but first need to try their counterpart  Son of A Gun to round out the gastronomical duo.

Animal. How does one even describe you? You're kind of like that wonderfully sweet and obnoxious hipster friend that everyone talks about but is always a little out of reach. Yes, they're called "animal" but do they have great seafood? Do they have vegan options? Who the eff cares. They have veal tongue and foie gras and I would sell my soul to have that meal everyday for the rest of my life. I have to admit. The first time I came here was on a date. Let's just say I didn't care as much about the date as I did about the food.  We started off with bone marrow and garlic bread. I thought i was going to die from happiness. I knew the date and I wouldn't work out as I pushed his spoon out of the way for me to have more marrow. IT WAS THAT GOOD. Next. We had sweetbreads. Good. Not great. I would have it again but it was nothing compared to what came next -- the second coming.   What happened next made me question my existence in life and why I was on earth. It was THAT good. I had the veal tongue and smoked foie gras.  I have no words to describe the amazingness that is veal tongue and smoked foie gras. I need to go back tonight. We ended with such a buzzkill it wasn't funny -- pig tails served buffalo/ranch style.  Blah. Chewy and not good.   I loved the inside of the restaurant and it was intimate and beautiful. I believe it was free sparkling water and the bathroom was nice (WAY in the back).  I got reservations for 2 about 6 hours before (on a Tuesday).  Be SURE to get reservations!!!

Do note that this place gets a really high 4 stars from me but two things they did were just bad enough to drag it down. Lets talk about the food since that's what we all really want to know. We had the chicken fried sweetbreads to start, a very bad start indeed. i love the creamy soft texture of sweetbread but that was lost with the batter. i can understand the contrast in textures but there wasn't enough sweet bread. The next dish was a star for me, the crispy rabbit legs. Tender, yes i said tender which i don't get often from rabbit, with a a chermoula, Meyer lemon aioli. the spices enhanced the rabbit while the acid from the Meyer lemon cut the richness perfectly. foie gras loco moco, talk about a heart stopper of a dish. you take a dish that's already rich and what do you do? add foie gras! i am sad to know that foie gras won't be sold in Cali starting July. The hamburger patty was delicious. the rice they used is perfect. the little broken rice you'd get from Vietnamese rice plates. i don't have much to say here other than i devoured this dish. i love bone marrow and i am glad to see it's more common on menus these days. but with that this dish didn't excite me. maybe I've had too much food already, maybe i like my "butter from the gods" to stand out more than the chimichurri. i don't know this next dish we got is amazing. even more amazing than the loco moco. We had the foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy. If the french were to have invaded the south, this would probably be what would be served for breakfast. the combination of sweet and salt, the savoriness just amazing on the palate. it also helps that it has foie gras. this last entree was bad in many ways. the poutine with oxtail gravy and cheddar. when i get poutine one of the joys is sinking my teeth into squeaky cheese curds. I can't fault them for going with cheddar but maybe a little more cheese please? That is just the tip of the iceberg on this dish. The gravy was too heavy and way to salty. i thought it was me since i don't care for to much salt on my food but when my guests who love salt in their food was complaining to me, i knew for sure there was just to much salt. overall a good place to eat, maybe not every week but a fun place to go see what someone play with food and do it well.

Honestly, I thought I'd like it more since I'm such a meat eater. I went about a year and half ago so perhaps it has improved. The marrow was tasty. The pig ear was okay but not as exciting as I had hoped. I can't remember the rest but I wasn't dying for more. Based on current reviews, I would definitely like to try again.

I was the first in line to get into this place because I didn't have a reservation...and boy was it worth it.  I had to knock one star because for a restaurant to do well, you'd think they would put up some freakin' signs so you know you found the place right?  It is really really really hard to find.  Just find the vicinity of the restaurant, then find some parking.  Then as the pirates would say "take a walk."  The bar is where the fun is at.   Pork belly sliders were awesome.  I usually don't like liver but man, that foie gras was awesome.  I never had anything like it until I had it here.  A must try for something "different." Next up, there sister store!

This is one of those type of food where they give you a very small portion with bursting flavors.... it's just enough to satisfy your taste buds. I loved every plate me and my friend ordered. Their Pig Ears were amazing, had a good tang to it. The Tandoori Octopus was so freaking delicious! It tasted like octopus steak. Poutine Fries were good, a bit on the saltier side, but very savory. Veal Tongue was sweet & salty.. my least favorite, but not gonna lie, it was still very tasty to me. I'm very curious about the rest of the menu.. will definitely come back for more :)

Their house white wine was only $20 a bootle and we enjoyed.  As for a red wine, you should bring yourwine. Corkage fee is only $20!   Poutine oxtail was yummy!  I recommend it to share.  A little too rich as an entree.  Foie gras biscuit was amazing but again it's better to share with your friends.   Entre recommendations are rabbit leg, stakes, and the duck!  Not too rich and yet great flavor.   Ah, yummy!

Oh animal...you were everything I hoped you'd be. I only wish i was not suffering from East coast jet leg when I embarked on this incredible meal of meat but i'm obviously not complaining. I made it through and will make sure to be more awake for my next visit...because I'm absolutely going back next time I'm in LA. On this trip to LA to visit my friends, my boyfriend and i made it a point to enjoy all the foie in Cali before the ban this August. Animal was our first stop...we ordered 3 dishes that highlighted foie gras out of 8 or 9 and two were probably my favorites of the night. The foie gras maple sausage biscuit and the veal tongue with smoked foie gras  mouse, pastrami spices and crab apple. Hands down the veal tongue won for me. I will forever think of it as salty/sweet/creamy deliciousness on a plate. It's in the running for favorite dish on the trip. Foie gras aside, the rest of our meal was fantastic. The baby kale salad was delicious and a refreshing addition to a heavy meat packed meal and the pork belly sliders were tender, delicious and melt in your mouth tasty. Food aside, the place was casual and comfortable. It was a great place to be with friends on a Friday night out for dinner. Our waiter was attentive. My only complaint may be that I wish they paced the meal out a little more but I am really not complaining that much. Go to Animal...and please get the veal tongue dish for me before it's gone!

The foie gras loco moco is super good..... super sad no more foie gras....  It was 35 bucks for a plate but worth every penny.  Maybe without the foie it will be just 10 bucks but will definitely be not as good. The hamachi was really great.  the soft shell crab was super spicy... too spicy for my taste but that is just me.  The foie gras on biscuit with maple sausage gravy was also good but not wow.  Maybe I am just getting OD'ed on foie gras before the ban! If only they can do a foie gras dessert, I will order that too but the chocolate bacon dessert was a great option!  It was super YUM!!!

This place couldn't have any tastier food than it does now. Two things to warn about: Reserve in advanced because it's a very busy spot and doesn't seat many people either...and be prepared to dish out cash for some delicious ass food. Serving size is TEASER status. Items ordered included: foie gras loco moco foie gras with biscuit and gravy pig ears with chili, lime, fried egg flat iron with artichoke hash, truffle parmesan fondue bone marrow with garlic bread oxtail poutine cheddar bacon crunch First off...the foie gras is unbelievably delicious. It melts in your mouth and is bursting with flavors. I'm not a fan of any liver but that stuff, I'll eat for days. The pig ears was pretty good considering it had lime squeezed all over it and had a sunny side up egg on it. The flat iron was ordered medium so it was was still juicy and tender. The bone barrow was a perfect spread over the bread and a great way to start the meal. The cheapest and heaviest of those items was the oxtail poutine cheddar, which was also one of the best items of that entire menu. Last but not least, the bacon crunch. The chocolate was very rich and the bacon crumbs add the perfect amount of saltiness to compliment the sweetness. I recommend this to everyone...whether you're a foodie or not. It's a must try.

This was my second trip to Animal, and despite being delirious from jet lag, I enjoyed every bite. Highlights: - Foie Gras Maple Sausage Biscuit:  I could eat this every morning for breakfast.  The gravy is sweet and spicy all at once, and the foie goes with it perfectly. - Veal Tongue with Smoked Foie Gras and Pastrami Spices:  One of my favorites of the meal, the tongue was so tender, yet gristly with pastrami spice on the edges.  Alternating between bites of that and the foie had me in heaven. - Foie Gras Loco Moco:  Well this was fascinating.  So many primary components that all work so well together:  foie gras, quail egg, spam, hamburger, and a very flavorful rice.  Delicious and summery and heavy and addictive. - Pork Belly Sliders:  Incredibly huge slabs of perfectly tender pork belly, with generous mounds of slaw on tiny buns.  I could eat ten. - Melted Petit Basque: a little crock of hot cheese with a layer of chorizo and onions underneath, to be scooped onto crusty bread.  Warm and cozy and I'm sure very good for you.   - Tres Leches: One of my very favorite cakes in the world, done heavily (as if tres leches isn't heavy enough by definition!).  Delicious. I was tired, but I made it through, and went home incredibly full and satisfied!  I'm almost glad I don't live close to this place, I'm not sure I'd be able to keep away.

My dear friend Eva was in town and not only is she a gourmet chef but we both LOVE food. The textures, the tastes, and the way you roll it around your mouth and then given the right opportunity turn around and sing it's praises. When she was visiting Los Angeles from Nor-Cal and during her break between weekends cooking for one of the art groups featured at Coachella we managed to grab dinner. She requested that we hit up Animal and once I looked at the menu I couldn't resist saying yes! Our friend Noosha joined us. We ordered 7 dishes between the three of us: Grilled baby broccoli, smoked trout, crispy egg, romesco We all loved this! The egg was perfectly hard boiled and flash fried in a very light crusting of panko breading. The romesco sauce was light and suited the dish perfectly. BBQ pork belly sandwiches, coleslaw Pork belly is one of my favorites and these sliders were executed perfectly. The mixture between the bun and the slaw and the pork was divine. It was definitely something I would have felt would have turned out to be on the heavier side of things but was really light and well balanced. Hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut This dish had the perfect layering of spice (serrano chile) that went great w the Animal house Cabernet Sauvignon. Apparently I had all of the mint on the plate and it really made each bite zing! Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy lightest biscuit and gravy I've ever experienced. All of the flavors blended seamlessly. It was quite savory to the point of almost being able to pass for a dessert. Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar This was tasty but we all agreed that compared to the rest of the dishes it came across as rather heavy. Desserts! Bacon chocolate crunch bar, w salt and pepper ice cream oh em gee! Everything I hoped it would be and more! The salt and pepper ice cream combined with the crunch bar is the perfect blend of smoky, sweet, and spicy. The crunch layer in the middle was comprised of nutella and peanuts. Tres leches, dulce de leche Honestly, I felt like this was nothing to write home about. It wasn't bad it was just outshone by the other dishes. All of the waitstaff are eye candy, and very unobtrusive. We never had to fill our wine or our water and they cleared our plates between each major serving. Between the three of us and the 2 bottles of wine we had our bill was under $200 altogether with tip. Animal was a steal for the amount of amazingly executed food and service that was had.

Everyone's pretty much reviewed this, so I'll review a dish that no one's paid attention to. The fried tendons with pho dip. The tendons were meh- it was similar to a Vietnamese shrimp puff chip that you fry, and it expands. What was really amazing was the dip. Holy macaroons! Let me say, as a Vietnamese girl who has grown up with the best cook ever, my mom, I approve. Also, the halibut toastado has "goi" on it. Goi= Vietnamese cole slaw salad. Very refreshing, but if you're not into fish sauce, do stay away. It was an experience but I wouldn't go back really. Service was amazing. We always got new plates for every other course and our cups were always filled.

I read all of the rave reviews, seen the photos, watched Anthony Bourdain drunkenly proclaim its greatness. The hype for Animal was at maximum level for me, dangerously vulnerable to being easily overrated. It was set to be doomed from the start. But the second I took a glimpse at the menu, a Michael Bay directed montage rushed through my mind with fiery explosions of juicy foie gras and crispy pig ear slapping me in the face. With every dish, I caught myself shouting to myself: "That sounds damn good," unknowingly smiling from ear-to-ear, probably pretty creepily. Animal turned out to be one of the best eating experiences I've ever had in the LA area. --------------------------- FOOD: Beef Tendon Chips w/ Pho Sauce: Delicious as all hell. They appeared and crunched like perfectly-fried chicharrones, but had the delicious flavor of beef tendon. I could eat these all day everyday. The pho sauce was interesting, but the chips really didn't need it -- they were awesome by themselves. Bone Marrow w/ Chimichurri: Excellently-prepared bone marrow with a nice, garlicky chimichurri on top. I'm a bone marrow minimalist, so I actually prefer just the fatty flavor of the bone marrow with a little salt -- that's how I believe it should always be prepared. Although the chimichurri definitely overpowered the natural goodness of God's butter, it was still damn tasty. Pig Ear w/ Fried Egg: I loved this dish. Citrus-marinated crispy pig ear slices mixed with the runny yolk of a fried egg. Pork Belly Sandwich: I thought this sandwich could have been done a bit better. The flavors were tasty, no doubt, but I think the pork belly was a little too well-done. All in all, it was good, but a bit boring; given the wild creativity of the other dishes, I expected this one to be a bit different from your typical pork belly slider. Foie Gras Terrine: Excellent terrine -- the foie gras flavor went extremely well with the pickled onion and orange marmalade. The toast was a bit boring and actually not well toasted -- could've gone better with a crostini or at least something with more crunch. The terrine was awesome though. Oxtail Poutine: Perfectly crispy french fries with a tasty gravy filled with a generous portion of tender oxtail. It was a bit on the saltier side, but delicious nonetheless. Lettuce w/ Beets & Avocado: We got this just to try to balance out the gluttonous artery-clogging that we were undoubtedly going to experience from our meal. It was good, but I mean, it's a salad. Hamachi Tostada: The hamachi tasted fresh and the tostada shell provided a nice crunch. The flavor was good, but I'm not sure if it really fit with the flavors of the rest of our meal. Foie Gras Loco Moco: Now for the main event. The foie gras loco moco was definitely the best dish of the night, and arguably one of the best dishes I've ever had. I mean, how the hell can you ever go wrong with foie gras, spam, burger, and quail egg covered with gravy? The foie gras was perfectly seared and all of the flavors meshed together so well. The beauty of it was that the buttery fattiness of the foie gras doesn't get compromised by all of the other flavors. It's a true testament to the power of the foie, and how horrible life in California will be once the dark apocalypse arrives on July 1st, when foie gras will be outrageously banned. I expect Animal to be picketing tooth and nail to overturn the ban, because I don't know if my experience would have been half as awesome without the Foie Gras Loco Moco. Yup, we ended up ordering two. I wanted three. Total: $220 (including tax, tip, and 1 bottle of house Cab) --------------------------- Atmosphere? Service? I actually don't really remember anything else about Animal other than the food, which is a testament to how good the food was. If there ever were a physical manifestation of all that is great about being a carnivore, Animal would be it.

My favorite place to eat in all of Los Angeles.  I used to live in LA and I would try to eat at Animal once-a-week. I refer all of my friends there when visiting and each time I return, Animal is first on my schedule.  Delicious food, great staff, minimal design in the establishment but still so sophisticated and fantastic. 5-star for sure.

Animal, I still love and adore you! What you can do with bovine, swine and fowl flesh still amazes me. Thanks for another lovely evening chock-full of chicken sweetbreads, pork belly sliders, foie gras, fried rabbit legs, polenta and poutine. BUT, you need to regroup and reconsider your interpretation of carrot cake. What we were served was nothing short of confusing. Hugs and kisses, Gary R.

Holy fuck. You are delicious. MUST HAVE Hamachi tostada: Fresh thinly sliced hamachi, crunchy fried won ton strips, crisp cabbage, sweet peanuts and spicy peppers all tossed with a salty/sour fish sauce dressing. Chicken liver toast: Order comes with 1 piece. Perfectly grilled bread with a smoky char topped with sweet, savory chicken liver pate with a sweet and tangy balsamic reduction. This thing is the perfect combination of crunchy, creamy, sweet, salty, tangy. So fuckin good. Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy: This thing comes with a huge piece of perfectly cooked foie gras. It's pure sweet fatty deliciousness on a buttery, moist biscuit and covered in a creamy sweet/savory sausage gravy. I felt like I was having a heart attack eating this thing but it was so worth it. Bone marrow, chimichurri, caramelized onions: I love all things fatty so of course bone marrow is always a must have for me. Rich melt in your mouth fat topped with a bright and crisp chimichurri and sweet caramelized onions. Other stuff... Tandoori octopus: The octopus was perfectly cooked and not chewy but this dish was just ok. The tamarind sauce was much too sour. Baby kale: Slightly bitter fresh baby kale thinly sliced tossed with a lemon, olive oil dressing and freshly shaved parmesan. A nice change from all the super rich dishes. Deep fried tendon: Wow I've NEVER had tendon like this in my life. It was light, crispy and almost like a chiccarone. It had some sort of lime, salty, almost togarashi flavor to it. It came with a rich, creamy dip. Side note: Portions are small but flavor is BIG so you do get stuffed pretty easily. Especially if you get all the super rich stuff. Which I love cause butter + fat = awesome.

One of my foodie friends and I have a competition where we try and one-up each other with the restaurants we take each other to. After he took me here, I had to throw the towel in. This is honestly the most memorable meal I've ever had. Kicking myself that I haven't been back.

My review got deleted somehow... which sucks because I wrote so much... but here is what I remember. Best bone marrow ever. Not only is it perfectly roasted and herby, the Texas Toast they use absorbs so much flavor. The bread itself is just so pillowy and crunchy... that I could snack on it for days. Mixed with a well executed bone marrow... I'm probably going to need a doctor. I would put this as a must order over a lot of other staples. Obviously get the stuff with Foie before the ban kicks in, most notably the Loco Moco. Foie on top of a thin slice of spam on top of a burger. This has no gravy... instead its a sweet almost teriyaki like sauce with some sriracha. Topped with a quail egg (I wish it was 2 quail eggs) this was a beautifully crafted dish. I would recommend eating all the meats together. Then again I love foie, so I ended up polishing all the other meat while saving the foie for last! Most underrated ingredient = the green onion/scallions. This really brings out the flavor and prevents you from being overwhelmed by the meats which to some might be salty at times (to me it was perfect), but tasting that scallion flavor really tickles your tongue. The gf also said the Foie Biscuits are amazing when she went again, which makes me wish we ordered it then. The Chicken Pate was also good. Toasted bread with chicken liver pate spread. Its a good starter dish for those who like something thats irony but not overly fatty. The bread is more of a traditional crusty bread as opposed, which works great with Pate's and the foie terrine. Bring money and order foie everything. Seriously. Its getting banned. They sell it here. Enjoy it while you can in California.

I came here a handful of times and never did fail me.  Each time was an experience and enjoyed each of my favorite dish more!  I had hamachi, kale salad, bone marrow, pig, foie gras, pork sandwich and more.  Those were a few that i can remember and all is perfectly presented, heavy, and flavorful.  The service was top notch and the decor is clean and modern.  It is a bit hard to find the location if you don't know the area too well since it has no signs.  The bacon chocolate bar was just okay for me.

My hopes were so very, very high. First of all, let me be the first to say that I love interesting, original, and delicious new food. I'll be the first to dive into a plate of creatively-prepared cartilage and the last to leave. That being said, Animal was a huge disappointment. We ordered 6 dishes - pig ears, fois gras biscuit, chicken liver toast, steak, kale salad, beet salad, and sweetbreads. The pig ears were insanely salty and we returned it after each taking a bite. It was just... bad. The chicken liver toast was okay. The steak was okay but the salads and sweetbread were boring and unimpressive. I LOVED the fois gras biscuit, but then again, I love fois gras, period. This was prepared well, and if I had to go back and order anything again, it'd be this dish. Service was fabulous and funny, the food was just subpar. So disappointed in my Animal experience... Sigh.

Foie Gras!   I have found a new lover and it is Foie Gras, and it is leaving me on July 1st due to the statewide ban in California.  Luckily I will be traveling to Montreal in August so I will get to have it again.   We started with the chicken liver toast which was good.  But the main reason I came to Animal is to try the foie Gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy.  I probably should have order three of these since it was so delectable.  It had a sweet taste and every bite melted in my mouth.  So many different flavors and textures that I will hope to revisit in the near future (probably not in CA).  We also ordered the poached halibut, coconut broth, morels, asparagus, herbs.  This was fantastic.  All the combined flavors in this dish molded so well.  The mint coconut taste at the end lasted until the next dish arrived or when I decided to take a drink out of the sour beer that I ordered.  The bone marrow with chimichurri and caramelized onions was okay.  Probably wouldn't order it again.  The texture seemed to fatty to my liking.  BBQ Pork Belly was pretty good.  And the last item we ordered was the veal tongue.  I was afraid to give this a try but I am glad that I did.  The veal tongue reminded me of bacon.  With the tongue came smoked foie gras, pastrami spices, and crab apple.  I finished this and was a very happy camper that I got the chance to try this dish.   I am eager to come back to this restaurant or try Son of a Gun in the near future.  What makes Animal even better , is how close it is to Canters Deli which is only four doors down.  So I can always pick up dessert after I gorge at Animal. Cheers

Creative dishes + hip hop music + dessert = baller ass dinner! Animal house wine Crispy Pig Ears Hamachi Tostada Tandoori Octopus/Squid Bone Marrow Poutine Tres Leches Mint Tea Everything tasted great but the reason for 4 stars is the "Bold" flavors.  A couple of the dishes were a tad too salty or citrusy... and I'm a forgiving eater.  I enjoyed all of the dishes we orders! Their house wine was nice and yummy, very fresh fruity cab sav.  I think the best part was the tres leches cake and mint tea.  The cake was not too soaked and the mint tea was just mint leaves steeping in hot water... very refreshing. Service was nice and professional.  Definitely make reservations.  They have valet parking out front  underneath the umbrella.

I was hesitant to try this restaurant since my experience at "Son of a Gun wasn't that great."  My colleague came here with his wife for valentines and strongly encouraged me to try it, especially with all the many foie gras options.  Everyone kept telling us that reservations were nearly impossible for this place, so we decided to go through the concierge service and booked the restaurants.  The night of our reservation, the restaurant was half empty, so that was kinda odd.   I have to still stick to the similar review I wrote of their 2nd restaurant, "Son of a Gun".  I didn't see see much creativity from the food and the taste was just mediocre at best.  Most of the dishes we tried were similar to dishes you can get at other ethnic restaurants.  I didn't really like the food and service much that I didn't bother taking pics or recording what I had.  I did enjoy the company though.  Maybe it was the jet lag that made my friend a bit more amusing. I think Colbert puts it best when it comes to creativity.  "A creative act, then, would be seeing something that already exists and saying, 'I wanna use that, in a different way'...that's also theft"

Food is a 3~ but the specialty beer from Japan brings it up to a 4. Menu here is def' an adventure~ if you love organs, animal appendage, cartilage, and using your spoon to scrape off the bone marrow then smothering it all over your bread... I say this is the place for you! Although I love to try anything once and restaurant hop all over the city, this place def' made me say, "o-m-g!!!!" not b/c the food was so good but what you see here on the menu is not what you would typically see on a restaurant menu~ Feeling adventurous? order a random dish from this restaurant, but if you feel reserved you can opt to order hamachi salad, drink some specialty beers and eat the chocolate crunch dessert like me~ hahaha

Eh, 3.5 stars. I've heard so many good things about Animal so I was expecting a lot. I guess expectations lead to disappointment. The inside of the restaurant was super loud and dark which is not ideal for eating such heavy food. (Hard to stay awake!) We also had problems making a reservation. They set it for the wrong time, then said they would give us a call back to get to the correct time, but then set it for really late. geeeez. Bone marrow = ok, had much better at marche moderne in costa mesa (they also give you two pieces instead of 1!) Veal tongue = liked this but couldnt taste the foie gras Balsamic pork ribs = ok Oxtail poutine = heavy, but good. the oxtail was well flavored and there was a lot. the fries are definitely double fried bc they are really crispy

Animal Took me to a very fun and unique food experience. I really enjoyed the food and the ambiance I ordered: BBQ Pork Belly Burger: Amazing............the meat was cooked to perfection and adding a bun to the equation took the burger to the next level Yellow Tail Tostada: Fresh Ingredients; must order Loco Moco: Ok; I've heard so much about this dish; however, it was too salty and had too much going on

My fiance is a man of few words and emotions...he came of the restaurant stating that this may have been one of the best meals he's had.

As a kid, my mom would take me to the movies and we would never buy food at the theaters, instead we would stop at a KFC drive-through and bring like 40 hot wings to our seats in her purse haha. Anyways, the point is: that I love KFC because I think I subconsciously associate it with good times as a kid. Therefore, for the past 20+ years of my life, I've always said that my last meal if I was death row would be a bunch of KFC hot wings (and a Home Alone DVD).  A few months ago, this all changed. A few months ago, I was introduced to Animal and I was blown away.  Every dish that I ate was more amazing than the last, and the finale (not the desert), the Foie Gras Loco Moco pretty much made up for every remotely negative thing that has ever happened to me. You know how Akon has that song with the chorus that goes "Doesn't matter, I just had sex"?  Well, I got a parking ticket that same night, and I couldn't care less.  Because honestly it doesn't matter, I just had a bomb ass loco moco.

I finally had the chance to check out Animal for my birthday! It was a pleasant surprise as I have been meaning to come here for the past year! While it has been a bit over hyped for me, I did enjoy the food and service. The space is small, so tables are set closely together and you can feel cramped. But the food and great service make up for the lack of space! Our server recommended two new beers we had never tried, of which one I will definitely be running to the store to purchase in the near future! A few of the notable items we ordered were the lamb tartar, pig ears (a bit salty) and the bbq pork belly sandwiches. We also ordered the shrimp & rabbit spring rolls, which I found to be fairly standard and average. But I do love rabbit! For dessert, we went with the raving Yelp reviews for the bacon chocolate crunch bar, which was good, but not as great as I expected it to be. The salt and pepper ice cream was great, though! Don't forget that the menu is tapas style, so be prepared to share!

Neat little place with beautifully created dishes, however portions are very small so a bit overpriced. Service was very mediocre, but I applaud their knowledge of which dishes are made with peanut oil for those with allergies. Noise level too high, almost have to scream across the table. Nice variety of wine and beers. I like the changing daily menu and fresh ingredients. Favorites were the duck and octopus. Would try elsewhere next time.

They made octopus taste good, no small feat in my book. I wanted to love this place but I am supposedly "not really a foodie" per my friend who dines on foie gras and truffles every chance he can. I am a simple girl who wants her food fun and well made but pronoucable. I also avoid meals that will just remind me of my favorite Disney characters. You need to be adventurous to really love this place but if you are, you WILL love this place. We enjoyed some fantastic wine and mooched off of each others plates. I got the flat iron steak in a truffle cheese sauce that was so very yum. The tres leche was the best I'd ever had. Make reservations in advance, this place be popular.

Utterly Amazing! Just go, make a reservation and go! Even if you are not an adventurous eater the food is prepared in such a way that even the meek will enjoy every morsel. Have everyone order something and share: Loco Moco: Meat is murder, tasty tasty murder. I am not one to eat Foie Gras, but if your going to indulge and renege on all your ethical stances on the treatment of animals, do so with this dish. Bone Marrow: Two Please! They do not prepare this dish in a traditional way, but it is delicious all the same. For the timid, the marrow is covered in melted onions and romesco, The "Sweetbreads." For the uninitiated: they contain no bread and are not sweet. They are actually the Thalamus glands of bovines. They are fried to perfection in an amazing sauce. Salt and Pepper Ice Cream with Bacon Bar. This was a wonderful desert, I think I liked the Ice Cream more than the Bacon bar, but the pair hit the spot.   Not gonna lie, its pricey, but soooooo worth it.

Oh, Animal. The place I have wanted to dine at for so long. I say dine and not eat because this experience is nothing short of a traditional "dining" experience. I loved how the dishes come out from lightest to heaviest and they put an intermezzo in there..bravo! I went with two friends and we shared 13 (yes, 13! I know I'm still stuffed) dishes between us. All I can say is that everything was spot on, delicious, amazing, savory, life-changing, beautiful, and bold. I won't go over all the dishes but my favorites were: Baby Kale Salad: I loved how all the ingredients in this salad took the side stage as they were all there to make the kale the main star of this dish. Foie Gras Biscuits and Gravy: The foie melted all over the sweet and savory sausage gravy and it was balanced perfectly with the crunch of the biscuit and the sweetness of maple. Ahhh Veal Brains: I was scared to try this. As the dish came to the table the perfume of curry and vadouvan permeated the air and made our mouths water.It was one of the most tender pieces of meat I have ever had. Outstanding. So you may be asking..why only four stars? Dessert. What a shit show. For such an amazing restaurant, you'd think they would hire a decent pastry chef to round out the fabulous experience.. I think dessert creates the perfect "sweet" ending to any night out and Animal failed horribly on that front. Not even a pastry chef..how about a pastry line cook?

Came to this restaurant because my friend wanted to try it. The set up seemed industrial but definitely a good look for this place. Didn't like the fact that we had to order all of our plates at one time. Maybe things have changed but at that time, being not too long after they had opened, they were so busy that having to order everything at once made it feel like they wanted you to order, eat then get out. They chose the order that the food came out. I expected everything to just come out when it was ready but that wasn't the case. We ordered the crispy pig ears, baby kale, pork belly sandwich, hamachi tostada, pork ribs and the foie gras loco moco. The order they chose to serve the food was from light to heavy so by the time we got to our last few dishes, the richness of the food was just too much.  I would have preferred to put the hamachi tostada and baby kale in between some of the dishes to cleanse the palate a little bit but that wasn't a choice we were given.  The bacon chocolate crunch bar for dessert was decadent but really good. Don't get me wrong, the food was really really good.  I just didn't appreciate how it was orchestrated.  If things have changed I would give it another try.

So here's the deal.  It's 2012.  There's this thing called an Interweb or something where I can go and get my reservations for 99% of the quality restaurants around town without having to pick up the phone.  It's convenient.  It's easy.  And in today's society, it's pretty much standard operating procedure.  So to have to make a phone call to make a reservation, I'd at least hope they pick up when you do. No such luck.  They call you back the next day and feign disappointment when they tell you, "Sorry, we don't have anything at 7PM, the earliest we can do is 11PM."  Really?  11 Freaking PM?  So you waste my time having to call your sorry little reservation line, then waste more of my time proposing a reservation you've got to know I have no intention of accepting.  JFC, just slydial me next time or something. Look I can get not wanting to fork over a big chunk of your profits to Open Table or whatever, but seriously, you can't have some nerdy kid hack together some sort of crappy reservation system for your website?  How about doing this by email?  A google calendar?  Anything would be a welcome change. Look the food is good, but seriously, join us in the modern age Animal, and let's not waste each others time going forward, k?

The foie gras, biscuit, and maple sausage gravy is divine.   The foie gras was perfectly cooked in all its fatty goodness and was magnificently complemented by sweet maple sausage flavors.  It had this heavenly breakfast feel.  Texturally, I thought at first  it was too mushy, but the more I ate, the more I felt - this is so 'effin unbelievably delicious.  At the end of the plate, we had only a little sauce left with a smidge of biscuit left...the waiter came to ask if he could take the plate away... and my friend and I both shook our heads violently "no", like the idea was totally absurd.   I also got the bacon chocolate bar and the hamachi tostada.  They weren't as mind blowing for me, I'm not a huge sweets guy, so the chocolate bar didn't wow me like the other Yelp reviews.  The hamachi tostada was good, but it felt really familiar to me in taste and composition, so nothing extraordinary.   I'm in Seattle, but I took some pictures of the foie gras (posted) and it puts a smile every time I take a look at it.

this place was okay. really really small place, gets really crowded for dinner. this is one of those places that serve animal parts in very small portions for a high price. so dont ever expect to come here to get full. if you are someone that enjoys this kind of delicacy and dropping extra $ just because you can, then go ahead and check this place out. cool ambiance, but the food was nothing particularly special for me for this kind of price. the one thing i find interesting about this place is that the menu is constantly changing. can be good or bad. but at least you have the opportunity to try a variety of different things. the only thing i remembered eating was the veal brain. can't really describe how it is, but it's very interesting. really soft and chewy. had a hard time grasping that i was eating brain. i don't regret coming here, it was definitely an experience, but i probably won't be coming here again

I heard foie gras was getting banned so I had to come out to do a last hoorah and actually try it before the opportunity was lost. I've been wanting to try Animal for quite some time now. Its sort of exploded and become one of the most popular restaurants in LA as of late so I ventured out to try some good eats. I set my reservation for 9:15pm two days earlier and admittedly got here at 9:45...(women). As a tip, this place is REALLY HARD TO SPOT because it doesn't have the name of the restaurant on it. Just GPS there and look for a place with a line and valet and that is probably it. Anyways, despite being late the staff still allowed us seating at the bar where they were more than obliged to help us pick which dishes were the favorites and best to choose. I ordered the Hamachi tostada ($15) thinking it would be a light, fresh dish to start. It was exactly what I was looking. yummmm. Next we got the grilled-quail which tasted like a more flavorful and perfectly cooked chicken that came with a side of sweet pears, apples, and a yogurt that added a nice touch to the dish. Onto the foie gras. We got the veal tongue, smoked foie gras, pastrami spices, crab apple ($13) dish. The staff member advised to eat them all together which when we did, tasted like what everyone else on this forum said as it tasted like a high class hotdog. For the last dish we ordered the foie gras terrine, blackberry jam, black pepper gastrique ($20). The foie gras on this dish was HUGE. It came out looking like a block of spam. The jam was very sweet, perhaps too sweet. The foie gras itself was good, but I felt like the huge portion compared to the amount of jam & bread that came with it was a bit off, and left me feeling like I had....too much foie gras for my liking. Aside from the last dish, I ate everything on my plate and was hoping for more. The amicable and informative staff added a nice touch to the place. Overall, it delivered on my expectations.

Had a satiating farewell to foie gras before the ban in July. Between us four, we tried 7 tapas style dishes including dessert. Made a reservation at 6:15pm and got seated immediately once we made it through the long line awaiting their opening at 6:00pm. Had the following dishes: - tandoori octopus - tender and well balanced flavors - foie gras & biscuit - loved the foie gras but the biscuit and gravy were a tad bit sweet for my liking - veal tongue - good but unremarkable - liquid foie gras agnolotti - scrump-diddly-umptious, eat it whole - foie gras loco moco - absolutely the winner of the night, but a little hefty at $36 - pig tails buffalo style - crispy pigtail skin, buffalo sauce, thin slices of radish, and celery leaves make up a very texturally yummy & fun dish to eat - Bacon chocolate crunch bar - great ending to our meal, mixture of Hazelnut, almond, and peanut chocolate bar with salt & pepper ice cream - delicious. Will definitely return to see how they switch up their menu after the foie gras ban. Overall , very well executed, balanced and innovative dishes. Pricing is a little hefty for portions. Very casual atmosphere & attire.  Average of 2 dishes per person recommended. Metered street parking was found easy enough at $1.00/hour from 8-8, max 2 hours.

The best meal I've had in 2012 so far. After many many months of waiting to go to Animal, I finally had the opportunity to go this past Thursday. Since I had never been and wanted to sample as many things as possible, we decided to split ten dishes between myself and two girls. Before I discuss the dishes I had, I want to note that every dish we sampled was at least good. My favorites in order: Pork Belly Sandwiches: Not sure there is anything in the world that tastes as good as these sandwiches did. The pork was fatty, greasy, smokey porkiness that was the best bite of the night. The brioche buns were so buttery and the coleslaw helped cut the fattiness and richness from the belly. Everything went together perfectly. 5 stars. Foie Gras Biscuit and Gravy: Seriously delicious. Very rich, very sweet, but between the sweet biscuit, perfectly seared foie and the sausage gravy, it was pure heaven. I was a little worried at first that it would be overly sweet, but it was superbly balanced. 5 stars. Fried Pig Ears with chili, lime and a fried egg: I am pretty sure I could die happy if I had this for breakfast every morning. The crispy, salty pig ears went perfectly with the runny egg. Loved a little bit of heat from the chili and acidity from the lime. 4.5 stars. Veal tongue, smoked foie gras, crab apple: When everything was combined, it literally tasted like a really really really good hot dog. The smoked foie was super light and not overpowering and was the perfect accompaniment for the tongue. 4 stars. Melted Petit Basque: gooey salty melted cheese, chorizo and grilled bread? That combination has no way of tasting bad and it did not disappoint. Really rich and flavorful. Wish it was bigger! 4 stars. Hamachi Tostada: This dish caught me off guard. While the fish was very mild, the greens, chilis and avocado made this combination of flavors really great. A great dish if you need a break from all the rich, heavy, fatty flavors from other dishes. 3.75 stars. Rabbit Spring Roll: These spring rolls were pretty good. Fairly mild rabbit loin was ridiculously tender and juicy. The spicy green curry went well with them. Another fairly light dish, probably would try something next time though. Crispy pig tails buffalo style- This was probably my least favorite dish of the night for me. Although perfectly executed, I found the dish rather one-dimensional and kind of got sick of it pretty quickly. If you are a fan of traditional buffalo sauce and blue cheese, definitely try them out. 3 stars. Both desserts (Bacon chocolate crunch bar and Dark knight carrot cake) were well executed and unique in their own right. If i had to pick, I would probably choose the carrot cake due to its complexity of flavors, but I did enjoy the crunch bar. Next time, I would forego the spring roll and pig tails and try sweetbreads, veal brains and the loco moco! Overall I was beyond impressed with Animal and I believe it is worthy of all the hype. Every dish was prepared thoughtfully and flawlessly. The food is fun, exciting and much different than your typical New American menu. I am glad I don't live close to Animal or else I would be here a few days a week!

5 stars for overall style. 4 stars for the taste of food. Animal was a really fun and entertaining eating experience. They have interesting dishes on the menu and the presentation is really beautiful. balsamic braised pork ribs- these were very tender and good but just didn't have that POW I needed.. foie gras loco moco- this dish is something I wish I could've made during my late night study days in college. It was very creamy, fattening, and cholesterol-tastic. Veal tongue with foie gras- this was the most unique dish we ordered. The tongue tasted liked Taiwanese sausage a bit and it came with pieces of fruit and a mousse-like foie gras. Very good and unique. I probably would not come back to Animal again because it was a bit expensive, but I think it's a great restaurant to bring a bf or just to try something new.

Pig ears, foie gras and rabbit legs. Want exotic? This place has got it. Went to Animal last month and was treated to a delectable selection of food. Everything on the menu looked tasty, but the friendly waiter recommended a few items that were out of this world. My friend and I ordered five dishes and a dessert. The serving sizes are pretty small, almost tapas-style, but nothing like you've had before. My personal favorite was the pig ear, spiced with chili, lime and a fried egg on top. Crack the yolk and let it drizzle over your food as you dig in and enjoy. The pig ear has the texture of a high-quality piece of bacon and nearly tastes like a chicharone. The BBQ pork belly sandwiches w/ slaw was really good; very similar to a pulled pork sandwich, only chewier due to the high fat content content. The polenta topped with bolognese sauce and parmesean was decent, but not my favorite dish. I tend to lean toward spicy dishes, and this was really bland. The foie gras, biscuit and maple sausage gravy was an interesting breakfast-style treat for dinner. The foie gras was cooked perfectly and literally melted in my mouth, but was overpowered by the heavy biscuit. After a few bites, I separated the foie gras because it was really THAT good all on its own. I never had rabbit before (Bugs Bunny fan here), but the braised legs with green beans and potato puree were AWESOME. Tender, juicy and the perfect end to dinner. For dessert, we cleansed our palettes with the refreshing berries, vanilla custard and lavendar crumble topped with basil. Pretty good. I totally plan to come back again soon, and highly recommend this place. Don't forget to make reservations because this place gets PACKED!

This place is amazing.  To be honest you can have an amazing meal with just appetizers....the churizo is amazingly good, oxtail fries delicious, foie gras is rich but great...the bacon chocolate is soo good...force your friends to share it.   The wine is expensive but good.  Overall, this place is really really good!

Holy loco moco, Batman! Where have you been hiding Animal from me all this time?! I have to admit I've known about Animal for awhile (sorry Batman!) but I just haven't been able to get my butt there yet. So many restaurants, so little LA time... Anyhow, FINALLY was able to get here and damn I wish I'd done this sooner! I went with a friend who is a food adventurer like myself so we ordered a slew of things to share. The only things we kept to ourselves (except for a tasting bite) were our foie dishes. I don't share my foie with anyone. ;-) Let's start with the chicken liver pate. Okay, I've had me some damn good chicken liver pate before but I have to say this here chicken liver pate pretty much trumps it all. Yes, it was THAT good...mmmm...mmmm. After the chicken liver pate, I had some HIGH hopes for the bone marrow cuz lord knows I love me some bone marrow. Unfortunately, it was less than stellar. Don't get me wrong.. I've never met a bone marrow I didn't like but did I love it here? Not really.. and the sad part is I'm not sure why. It  appeared to be cooked just right and the chimichurri on top was tasty but something about it was 'off'. I also though the bread they served with it was a tad too thick and didn't lend itself well to experiencing the bone marrow -- kinda overwhelmed it I think. Next was the pork belly sliders (recommended by the waiter)... which were amazing! Who'd have thought a little old pork belly slider could be so yummy? Not sure what they put in here but all I gotta say is keep doing what you do cuz it's working! On to the foie.. oh, the foie. *pitter patter goes my heart* I ordered the loco moco and my friend got the biscuits and gravy.  They were both fabulous but in the truest sense of loco moco - it wasn't quite true to the name.   I am a bit of a loco moco afficionado and pretty much order it anywhere I see it and the thing that makes the LM a tasty mess is the gravy mixed in with the egg seeping into every part of the dish. While the dish here was delicious, it wasn't a true 'tasty mess' as the little qual egg didn't contribute much in terms of yolk and the gravy was more of a sauce. While the addition of the foie gras to this dish is pure genius on Animal's part,  IMHO I think this dish could be perfection with a larger egg and a bit of a truer gravy. For dessert we had the tres leches and  bacon chocolate bar, They were both good but I felt both dishes were actually outshined by the salt n pepper ice cream (a side w the chocolate bar) which was so amazing. I'd order a big ole bowl of that anyday! All in all it was a fab night at Animal and I wouldn't hesitate to return.. in fact, hope to do so soon cuz there was a slew of other things on the menu I want to try!

I've been wanting to try out this restaurant for awhile, and was finally able to this past weekend. My bf and I ordered the following: polenta, six-hour bolognese, parmesan - the polenta was creamy and blended well with the bolognese melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread - I liked the concept of this dish...the cheese and chorizo were good, although a bit oversalted, and unfortunately the bread was overgrilled (almost cut the roof of my mouth) barbeque pork belly sandwiches - delicious! I was initially intimiated by the huge chunk of meat sandwiched between two small buns, but the meat was very tender and I finished off my slider pretty quickly ricotta gnocci w/ liver sauce - the gnocchi was a delight--soft and pillowy...but I did not care for the sauce at all poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - this was my first time trying oxtail, and I thought the dish was okay...I was somewhat disappointed that we paid this much for some meat on a bed of cheese fries Even though the servings were small, I was already full by the time we got our last dish, so we decided not to get dessert. The waiters were helpful and often stopped by to check on us and refill our waters. I wouldn't not want to come back here again, but the amount you have to pay for small plates is a bit steep. Overall, everything was cooked really well, but the components in some of the dishes did not work well together. Based on food alone, I would give this place 3.5 stars. The service brought it up to a solid 4.

Surprisingly decent wine list. Really good food and some not-so-good food too. The pig ear is delicious, seriously. So is the octopus. The poutine is pretty damn tasty too... but if you come here and leave without trying the moco loco you are a fool. Its kinda pricey from what I remember but its also AMAZING. Skip the chicken hearts... they were gross. (To be honest the whole idea grossed me out before they even came, maybe you'll like them if you're into that sort of thing.) If you're a vegetarian.. stay home.

Let me explain why I gave it a the before i'm crucified... There wasn't a line when we got there on a Monday night, but all the tables were reserved. We stated with the chicken liver pate on toast which was actually really good. The toast was buttery and a little sweet while the pate had a good flavor. They were definitely generous with the pate but there's only one piece of toast to go around. The kale salad with pecorino and lemon chili vinaigrette was good, but a little sour for my tastes, overall though, it was tasty. The hamachi tostada was probably my favorite because of the generous slices of sashimi and the way everything complimented each other. The Foie Gras biscuit was great, in fact there was a giant piece of foie gras but the problem was the gravy and biscuit were so heavy that you could barely taste the liver. The gravy itself was delicious but I could have had that on anything and enjoyed it. The worst thing that we decided to get was the ribs. Seriously. How can you mess up ribs?! The braised veggies that came with it were also nothing to rave about, but we were looking for delicious, dripping off the bone ribs. The meat was soft, sure, but the taste was something you'd find at Applebees. C'mon guys. So, food wise? I'd give it 3-4 stars. Nothing you're missing out on if you've had good Tapas. Service wise? I'd give it a 2. We were sitting at the counter and they literally forgot about us. We had to wait a long time for the last dish (ribs) and were left completely unsatisfied. We had to ask them if it was still coming and were on the verge of just telling them to cancel it. Gonna try Son of a gun, but I wouldn't say you're missing out on much here.

Definitely not the place to take any vegetarian, as the place is called, they offer delectable dishes of every sort of almost every animal. The place itself is pretty minimal inside. The wall is bare with naked lightbulbs spaced out evenly across. Tables are packed right next to each other and the lighting is pretty dim. Everything is focused on the food! Service was really great and our dishes were coming out quickly and in a timely manner. The dishes arrived in a good order and generally went from light to the heaviest dishes at the end. My three favorite dishes of the night! The polenta, foie gras biscuit and the bacon chocolate crunch bar. All 3 standalone with so many different flavors working together. POLENTA $10 This was the best polenta I've ever had! The texture and consistency of it was perfect, and the bolognese sauce on top really made it something else. I could eat this dish every single day if I had a choice. FOIE GRAS BISCUIT $24 There was so much going on in this dish that it was a bit crazy, but it all just worked so well together. The maple syrup was a bit weird at first, but it really added and accentuated the foie gras. BACON CHOCOLATE CRUNCH BAR $7 Chocolate and bacon??? Yes! Salt and pepper ice cream? What? But yes of course! At first I just imagined a strip of bacon dipped into chocolate...maybe a bit gross...but this was more bits of bacon with chocolate ganache. Deliciously rich and bacony. Then the salt and pepper ice cream, with chunks of salt to offset it. I was really tempted to order another one. And all the other dishes I ate, yummy also! CHICKEN LIVER TOAST $3 I love chicken liver mousse and at this price I could just order a gazillion of these, but I didn't as I wanted to eat other stuff. Perfect little piece of toast and a great way to start a meal. BBQ PORK BELLY SANDWICHES Yummy little sliders with a big fat piece of pork belly. Bit dry though but I loved the slaw that they put on top. VEAL BRAINS $14 Brains? Yes. Weird? Yes. Just tasted like gelantinous organs. Think of sweetbreads but more jellylike. Anything deep fried is good. TANDOORI OCTOPUS $13 I think Out of all the dishes, this had to be the most different. Had many refreshing light notes of yogurt and fruit. Decent way to break up the heaviness of meat. FOIE GRAS LOCO MOCO $35 Whoo...crazy loco moco. This was one of those dishes were its so good, you start to wonder if its appropriate to pick up the plate and lick it. The only thing is that it could've done without the big beef patty actually, and just enjoyed the foie gras. It was slightly too big and sometimes took over the dish. I'd say we were both pretty darn happy at the end of this meal. Some of the dishes seem pretty pricey, but they do give pretty big portions on those, plus a lot of their other dishes are very reasonable. I'm keeping Animal on my list of places to go!

You like parts which many other restaurants shun (ie sweetbreads, bone marrow, etc), then Animal is the place for you.  The only complaint that I have is that they use way too much butter, but other than that, this is a great place to make a meal out of small dishes.

Obviously, this place is good. I mean, 1400 reviews later and it's just hitting its stride. The food is SUPERB but what was surprising and refreshing was the gracious, uninhibited, completely unpretentious service. The staff knows they've got a good thing going and don't want to be the ones to mess it up. And that just makes for a perfect night. Let's start off with the lovely hostess seeing me waiting outside for my gal and offering to bring me a drink, to which I willingly obliged; a tasty IPA that hit the spot after a long day of work. Our waiter was friendly and (VERY IMPORTANT when two girls are catching up) never interrupted our chat once but brought out everything quickly, quietly, and expertly. And then there's the amazing Victor, who, when I asked to have the marrow bone wrapped up for my pup, brought me two in a doggie bag. Now, THE FOOD. We ordered six "slightly larger than tapas" (quoting the knowledgeable waiter) dishes. The standouts were the trout broccoli, which had this heavenly sauce and a soft boiled egg, wrapped in a breaded shell that, when cracked open, allowed the lovely yolk to run all over the trout broccoli goodness. That egg just make that dish so special. Then there was the Foie Gras Loco Moco which has rendered me incoherent as I can only declare it so EFFIN GOOD. After only five plates, we were full, and then the said Bone Marrow came and I started drooling all over again. How did they make such a fatty dish taste so light just by sprinkling chimichurri on top?! I've had a lot of marrow and usually it's a tasteless, fatty mess; not so here. At the end of our meal, my friend and I declared ourselves stuffed and happy. And then that sly waiter, without uttering a single word, plops down a menu, points to the bacon chocolate crunch bar with ice cream in the dessert section, nods, and then walks away. Of course when he came back 5 minutes later, we told him we HAD TO HAVE IT and no, we weren't sorry at all. I'm so glad my friend chose this place and I'm so glad it lived up to the hype. Bravo, Animal, BRAVO!

Two years ago when we visited LA, Animal was the first place we went to for supper and we were extremely satisfied, so while planning our current trip, we planned to continue the tradition.  We came to Animal on a Sunday night, and were welcomed extremely warmly, we sat down and ordered a glass of Lambrusco, that was fabulous.  We placed in our order for rabbit legs with mushrooms and green beans, and i ordered the flat iron steak with truffle parm fondue and artichoke hash.   It was funny because our service was so good, however after we ordered our meals, our server didn't bring the food to our table, and she never came by to ask how our food was, it is terrible feeling ignored. For our food, i loved the flat iron, it was cooked to how i specified, i liked the artichoke hash, and the capers helped to cut through the richness of the fondue.  I liked the flavour of the fondue, but the presentation was very dated, it was just slathered over the meat.  My sis had the rabbit legs, and they were tender, and the green beans gave a some colour to the plate.  She found there was a lot of rabbit, it would have been more successful, with a smaller portion. For dessert, we had the tres leche cake, and it was fantastic.  It was served a top Dulce de leche,which had a perfect consistency, sometimes it can be too thick.  The cake was just perfect, it had a very simple presentation, a few berries on the side would have been nice. Overall the food was good, the dessert better, the lack of service really brought our overall experience down.

Went to LA for the long weekend with the girls for my bachelorette party and Animal was on our list!  IT. WAS. DELICIOUS. Ordered almost the entire menu-wish we could've! Desserts were outrageously good-we did order one of every dessert, haha! Lucky that the foie gras ban isn't in effect yet in CA so we got to experience the variety of foie gras dishes...YUM.

Animal is a perfect place for food lovers. Even though their portions are small, the idea is to order a couple of things from the menu and share. The food varies from pork, to fish, to rabbit and quail, and it is all cooked with a cool mix of flavors.Good wine and  prices are not too crazy.

After hearing so much hype about Animal, I decided to give it a shot and surprise my bf for our anniversary dinner. I even made reservations a month in advance to ensure we were able to get a table.  Please make sure to make reservations ahead. :) Once we were seated, we decided to order a carafe of their house red to celebrate and also because it was so well priced. Below are pictures and review of our dinner. Chicken Liver Toast: This was delicious. It's a good start and introduction to chicken liver if you're not a fan or havent had it before. The balsamic reduction of shallots gave the chicken liver a rich texture and made it truly delectable. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Pig Tails- Buffalo Style - We ordered this one as a fun dish however I wasn't quite impressed. It was rather boney and seemed like the buffalo sauce was from a can. I would definitely not order this again. However, I have to say that their pickled celery was delicious. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Bone Marrow - I was really looking forward to this since I'm a huge BM fan. I wasn't a fan of theirs though. They put a chimichurri on top and it totally takes away from the flavor of the bone marrow. It overpowered it and it ended up tasting like i was eating chimichurri and toast. Fail. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Loco Moco w/ Foie Gras - This was my fave out of all the dishes. Everything was presented and cooked perfectly. The Foie gras really gives a great texture and flavor to the simple dish. Plus, i love how they used a quail egg to top it off.  I didnt want to eat it because it was so cute. =p http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Poutine with Oxtail Gravy and Fries - This one wasnt a hit for us.  The sauce was really salty and the oxtail tasted overcooked. And, the fries were definetley overcooked to the point that it was crunchy like a overtoasted baguette. So much potential though. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Bacon Crunch bar with a Vanilla Gelato - This one was a fun finish to our meal. I really enjoyed pairing chocolate, bacon, and gelato which was a first for me. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Overall, the concepts were great. I think they should work a bit on the execution  and this place could be a hit!

After numerous failed attempts... FINALLY got to try ANIMAL and I was NOT disappointed! One of the most delicious and unique dining experiences EVER! Came here for a birthday - which was perfect since Animal is definitely a restaurant you want to come with in a group and order a variety of plates! The 5 of us ordered 10 dishes and 2 desserts - and we all left happy and satisfied :) The decor is simple to say the least. No decoration, color, or even texture inside... just some retro light bulbs giving the restaurant a dim and industrial feel. You won't even find a sign outside to indicate which building is the actual the restaurant. Animal is all about the FOOD. --Baby kale, pecorino, lemon chili vinaigrette, breadcrumbs ($10)-- The baby kale was cooked down and tasted surprisingly good.. did not have the rough texture and bitterness of kale. Instead the dish had a tang from the lemons and a little heat from the chili. The breadcrumbs on top gave a little texture. --Lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac ($11)-- Fresh and yet creamy salad from the sumac + avocado but contrasted with the crunchy pita chips! A little bland for my taste.. but it was nice to have a light option amongst the heavier dishes. Great quality ingredients! The beets were some of the most delicious (usually HATE beets in my salad)! --Pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg ($12)-- Pig ear sounds gross - but it was one of my favorite dishes of the night! The pig ears are thinly sliced and fried to crunchy perfection! Did not taste fatty or heavy.. but more like a thin calamari! Like most fried foods - the acidity of the lime was the perfect compliment! The runny egg on top gave the dish more depth and a nice contrasting texture. The heat from the chili was also nice. --Grilled octopus, chorizo, spicy brown mustard, chowchow ($12)-- Meh. Pass. The plate looked really cool with the sauce + flowers.. but really not worth it. VERY little food on the plate and did not taste memorable at all. --Grilled baby broccoli, crispy egg, smoked trout, mustard, hatch chili ($13)-- Again... a nice light dish in contrast to the other heavier options. Simple broccoli dish with slices of smoked trout infused.. and a fried egg on the side. Nothing special in my opinion. But if you need a vegie option - go for this one. --Barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw ($13)-- The Animal regulars insisted on getting 2 orders (4 sliders) - after one bite I could see why. These little sliders are flavor bombs! You get a nice thick slice of pork belly topped with creamy cole slaw - all drenched in bbq sauce. Very messy to eat! I literally had wipe my hands and face with each bite! Just a little warning - it is very rich and the pork belly is very fatty. --Hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut ($15)-- DING DING DING! My favorite dish of the night! But yes, I am a sushi fanatic! Chunks of raw hamachi tossed in delicious vinaigrette - topped with tostadas and crunchy peanuts. The fish was fresh, lightly seasoned - and went well with the crunchy texture of the toppings. Almost felt like a Thai dish from the mint, peanuts, and cilantro.. but at the same time it was still very delicate. MORE PLEASE! --Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy ($24)-- One of Animal's more popular dish and definitely one of my favorite dishes of the night. Slice of seared foie gras on top of a fluffy biscuit - all placed on a plate of gravy. I was hesitant at first because it sounds SO heavy. Basically every component on the dish is made from FAT!!! But like most of dishes - you are only meant to have a few bites. And surprisingly, the dish was not greasy! RICH? Yes.. but delicious. The foie gras was crispy on the outside, soft and creamy in the inside. The biscuit - buttery, soft, fluffy - with a slight crispy crust! --Melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread ($12)-- Basically a fondue dish - toasted breast slices surrounding a bowl of melted cheese. Bread slices were buttery and crispy and the melted cheese was creamy, pungent, and thick. Not my favorite dish - but a lot of others really enjoyed it. I'm not much of a cheese fan. --Sticky toffee pudding, mascarpone, orange ($7)-- You are presented with 2 blocks of sticky toffee. Hard to describe this dish but the toffee had a weird texture - thick.. almost like a dried fruit. The dessert as a whole was not as sweet as typical desserts. --Tres leches, dulce de leche ($7)-- SO SWEET.. almost too sweet! A very WET dulce de leche cake on top of caramel. Make sure you order some tea or coffee to get it down! Tips: 1) Make reservations weeks in advance - or come early and sit @ the bar 2) Valet or street parking 3) Order approximately 2 dishes per person 4) MUST try: Pork Belly Sliders, Hamachi Tostada, Foie Gras + Biscuit + Gravy, and maybe the Pig ears :)

I've known about Animal for quite some time now, and have been wanting to eat here long before it was featured on Anthony Bourdain's show The Layover. Being that I'm from the Bay Area, it would be one hell of a destination dining meal if I came to LA for the sole purpose of eating here. So I made it a point to check this place out the next time I was in the LA area. So in a recent vacation to Santa Monica, I finally got that chance and boy it lived up to the hype. For the longest time I wanted to eat here solely because of the name. I mean, for carniwhore lovers such as myself, how can a restaurant appropiately titled "Animal" not invoke dreams of eating a wide array of hoofed and beaked creatures, accompanied only by the minimalist amount of vegetation??? First of all, this place is pretty damn hard to find. It's storefront facing the street is rather small and the fact that the restaurant is also unmarked doesn't help either. The way we found the place was by the large group of people waiting to be seated outside. The interior of this place is as minimalist as it gets. Bare walls, high ceilings, IKEAesque tables and chairs, and very dim lighting. We had ate prior in the evening, so I wasn't as hungry as I would have liked and therefore couldn't make use of the menu to the fullest. We ended up getting the pig ear dish as a starter, the foie gras loco moco as our entree, and finished with the tres leche dulce de leche dessert. Pig ears: I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The pig ears are fried and and then thinly sliced "julienne" style and tossed with lime and chilis. There are alot of nice contrasts in this dish...the crunchy pig ears reminded of pork rinds and were offset in texture and taste by the soft egg and acidity of the lime. The chili rounds out the dish with a hint of heat at the end of each bite. Well done. Foie gras loco moco: Pricier than your average loco moco, due to the fact that this dish comes with two generous pieces of foie gras. Initially, I thought this dish would be to small for us to share, but it actually being a moderate portion for us...just about right. The loco moco is built up in this order...a bed of rice, with a hamburger patty cooked to medium, a slice of spam, slices of foie gras, and a quail egg perched on top. This dish looked impressive and too damn pretty for us to dive into but we did anyway. The key to this dish is to try and get all components in one bite. This was my first time having foie gras and a quail egg before and they both were very delicious! Tres leche dulce de leche cake: And lastly we had a slice of this divine dessert to cap off the meal. It wasn't too sweet or too rich from exessive cream or milk. We both wished we could've taken home a whole sheet of this tasty cake. Superb! Animal is definitely not your ordinary, run of the mill restaurant. With their eclectic menu and cult following, it's easy to understand why it has made all the buzz that surrounds it. I'm glad to say that this place lives up to the hype...and I can't wait to return and indulge in another tasty "animal."

Dear Anthony Bourdain, I love you so much.  But you've led me astray.  I never imagined that after 3 shows, 2 books, and the countless personal conversations we've had (in my head) that it would come to this one moment. I made my reservation at Animal about a month in advance.  My bf and I were beyond excited to finally dine here.  Especially after your rave review on LA's edition of the Layover.  We also waited for a special occasion to come here (his bday). Here is a breakdown of our dinner: Veal tongue - I am not exaggerating when I say this tasted like ballpark hotdogs Bone marrow - the chimichurri overpowered the marrow.  Craft and commerce has waaay better bone marrow Veal brains - okay so this was okay. fried and rich Flat iron - overcooked.  even if they had gotten it right, it would've been just okay. But you would expect a meat place to be able to cook steak perfectly.  It was well done, not med rare The best thing we had was a bottle of wine... which we brought ourselves. I'm an adventurous eater and fell in love with the menu.  But every single dish we had was completely off.   I am not a fan.  Although we are not completely done, I have to warn you that our relationship is hanging by a very thin thread right now.  I hope you get it right next time. Love, No longer your #1 fan

I lived in Paris for 2 years.  I ate a lot of delicious food there.  Animal could exist in Paris and compete toe-to-toe. Everything was delicious.  There wasn't a single thing we ordered that was like "oh this is MEH." Flat Iron Steak w/truffle cheese sauce - HOLY SHIT why didn't anybody tell me the steak was so damn good?  My favorite hands down.  Imagine Umami's Truffle burger in steak format.  YEAH, that's fucking right.  Enough said. Chicken Liver Toast - my 2nd favorite of the things we ordered.  So good.  I'm a huge fois gras lover and used to eat it every week in Paris, but I would swap out a meal of fois gras for this plate any day Pork Belly Sliders - my 3rd favorite.  I've had pork belly sliders before so this wasn't a new, unique flavor for me, but the sweet bbq sauce on these bad boys is perfect amount of sweet to enhance the pork belly.   Fois Gras Loco Moco - good, but not anywhere near my expectations given how many photos of this plate are uploaded on Yelp and how many reviewers raved about it.  I think the burger patty was the weakest link.   Baby broccoli with smoked trout - Damn that was some good broccoli.  Reminds me Gorbel's broccoli, but better.

4.5 stars - Animal My first experience at Animal left me wanting to immediately make a reservation for the following weekend, so that I could try every menu item. I had a 6:00 PM reservation, established about a month in advance. Entering around 6 on a Saturday, only about a quarter of the tables were taken, beguiling since walk-ins aren't accepted. Within an hour, the place was completely full. It's incredibly small though it never felt forced and I never felt cramped. Here's the progression of our adventure this night: Chicken Liver Toast - Great value, delicious appetizer. Like a sweet and savory liverwurst with the balsamic reduction on top and the bread is nice and rustic. This is a great way to start. Octopus Tandoori - Great imaginative mix of tandoori-baked octopus, yogurt, cucumber, tamarind, etc..... This was executed very well, and though a small dish, this stayed in my mind the entire night. A must have in my opinion. Polenta - Another small dish, but oh so comforting. This was a delicious mix of creamy polenta and bolognese sauce. Like so many dishes here, this makes one think of familiar comfort foods. This is buttery, meaty, cheesy and creamy, and oh so good. Pork Belly Sliders - My partner loved these, they were her favorite. While good, I though the BBQ sauce smothered the belly flavor and also hit the appetite in a way other dishes did not. In other words, this was filling. Not my favorite, but unique and tasty all the same. Pig Ear - We ordered the pig ear after seeing the tables near us get it and being too curious ourselves, we had to try it. I liked this more than my girl, and to me, it's obvious why. The pork here is somewhere between pork rinds and bacon bits, thin crispy fatty slices that nearly dissolve in your mouth. The limey sauce it was delivered in was great I thought, but could be a bit too acidic for some. The egg of course helps to balance that out, while contributing to the dishes richness and flavor. Great dish. Biscuit and Foie Gras - An incredibly rich dish by any measure, this was substantive and impressive. This is a dish that really demands to be shared among many, or in our case, two. I thought the sausage here was a bit too much, that the liver only needed the syrup and biscuit. This was rich, indulgent, and satisfying. In conclusion, the foods at Animal are a re-imagined kind of history of comfort foods. This was, we agreed, probably the best meal we've had in Los Angeles. Enjoyed the lot with a 2009 Rochioli Little Hill Pinot Noir, but would not have been disappointed with the beers and wines (and soda, etc) offered at Animal. Considering that glasses of wine are nearly the same as corkage, we decided to bring a bottle. The wines they have are original and very interesting, with Provence and Cote Rotie offerings. I like to see so many "by the glass" wines offered, though they are $15 and up. We were very impressed, by the atmosphere, the service, the food, and the execution of it all. Foodies really owe it to themselves to try Animal.

everything here is so flavorful. Don't get me wrong..flavor is good but everything we ordered was all meat...which made every dish a little bit heavy...a little salad or something lighter to cleanse the palette would def make my experience better. what we ordered: melted petit basque with bread bone marrow with chimichurri pork belly sliders loco moco foie gras flat iron, artichoke hash, truffle parmesan fondue. my favorite was the infamous loco moco foie gras and the pork belly slider. mmm the loco moco foie gras...i want another one now!

I came here with my husband to celebrate our 6 month anniversary.  We had been talking about eating here for-EVER and were really excited when we were able to get a reservation on the exact day we were married 6 months earlier! ...And then we realized we had actually only been married for 5 months.  Oh well, it was still a phenomenal meal!  We ordered: -hamachi tostada: the mild fish was perfect with the flavors of the cilantro and chilies. -baby kale salad: actually one of our favorite dishes, even though my husband was really suspicious when I ordered this salad.  I crave this on a daily basis.  For real.  Try it and you will understand.   -biroche: our least favorite dish.  We LOVE cheese, so I thought this was a solid choice, but it ended up being a little too greasy and not that satisfying.  Also, it has a very potent odor, but the cheese tastes different than how it smells. So don't worry when you get a whiff of what smells like wet dog when they bring you this dish, I promise it will NOT taste like that!   -pork sandwiches: another favorite.  That is all you need to know. -poutine, oxtail gravy: I was surprisingly happy with this dish.  This was my husbands pick, and just like he was suspicious of my kale choice, I was suspicious of this.  However, as soon as they set it down and I saw it was an oxtail stew like concoction topped with cheddar cheese over delicious fries....I was sold.  It is really, really tasty. -pig ears: pig ear + chili + lime + fried egg = deliciousness.

5 stars bc it's such a unique place! highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time (at least 1-2 weeks ahead) so you dont have to wait as the restaurant is on the smaller side. portions are small so the restaurant recommends 4-6 plates per person. my favs were the hamachi, pork belly sliders, and poutine with oxtail gravy.

I've been wanting to hit this place up since I heard about it years ago. Finally, my finacee & I went on valentine's day. Went when they opened to try & get a seat since we didn't have reservations. Got a seat right off of the bat and ordered. The staff was very friendly and helpful. After checking out the menu, its clear that if you're not someone who enjoys eating "different" things, you most likely won't enjoy looking over the menu. Luckily we're Asian-foodies so we'll eat just about anything. Crispy pig head - This was like a pork croquette served over some potatos. It was pretty good. Delicate flavor which was different to me, because usually pork head (in Asian styles I've had) does tend to be a bit more flavorful. Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - This starts out as a very rich, flavorful, and homey dish. Like a comfort food. Warm & tender. However, it the cheese after a while does become a little overpowering. It begins to overwhelm the everything and we couldn't finish the dish. Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - This was probably my favorite dish of the night. The combination of the rich/fatty, with the biscuit and sweet maple gravy was very nice. The kind of dish you'd expect from a place as renowned as Animal. You take a bite and you look at whoever you're with with a happy/surprised look on your face. Foie gras, spam, loco moco - Had to try it. Spam, rice, beef, gravy topped with foie? WTF? In the end however, it was just as it is listed. Nothing more, nothing less. Perhaps because we already had a dish that had foie gras in it, it didn't seem to add much to the dish as a whole. It was just too much, actually. I feel this is the type of restaurant that many people will have vastly different opinions on. Some will love it, some will hate it. Definitely may try it again when the menu completely changes. Next time, I'll stick to only ONE foie gras dish, lol. This was a solid 3.75 out of 5 for me. While I enjoyed the experience, I have had comparable meals at half the price & less hype.

Animal was the bell that rang in 2008 to announce the kind of places we'd be getting for the next four years. Minimalist, chef-driven, transgressive, small plates. Without Animal, we wouldn't have a Fundamental, we wouldn't have an Umamicatessan. If you live in LA and refer to yourself as a "Foodie," first of all hit yourself in the head as hard as you can to hopefully lose the word from your vocabulary, then come here. Pig's tail, Buffalo-style - 3/5 Good, but greasy and fatty as all hell. The buffalo sauce and the ranch were standard. I wouldn't order this again. Balsamic Ribs - 5/5 This is going to be the one thing I order again and again every time I come here. Rich without being overpowering, meaty, great. Service - 5/5 Sat at the bar first, next to probably the loudest, most-annoying two people ever, and the server was nice-enough to move me to a two-top. Philosophical question - would Animal have done better in a Koreatown neighborhood, or did it do better in spite of not being in Koreatown?

So during this meal, no words were really exchanged except about the food. No, this wasn't an awkward first date. And I'm known to talk a lot except for when I'm eating good food. And this meal was hella mo'effin GOOOOOOOD. They have a 16 minute grace period. So, if you make it 16 minutes late to your reservation, they'll still honor it! This place is small so be here on time. Account for the lack of parking too if you want to opt out of valet. But I was lucky to find meter parking right in front of the restaurant. Okay let's talk about the food . Still/sparkling water is just 20 cents per person. What fancy restaurant does this?! Chicken liver toast. BombDOTcom. Seriously. It's just one small piece of baguette for $3. But it's worth it. The miso paste they put on top just complements the moist chicken liver spread so well. But miso paste tastes good with everything. Anyways, a must try! Next is the sweetbreads. I had NO idea what a sweetbread is, but my friend recommended it. It was okay. Not memorable. The sweetbread tasted like fried chicken. I didn't even take a picture of it because I didn't really like it. I bit into this piece of fruit on the plate. The dim lighting in this place + my nightblindedness made think it was some sort of sweet fruit. But it was a lemon. And my face puckered up like no other. Next I got the bone marrow, something I really wanted last time but never got to try. Surprisingly, the bread itself was the star of the dish. I just really like perfectly toasted bread that exudes a crunch everytime I bite. It was light, fluffy, yet crunchy. Bone marrow, if you haven't had it before, is used as a thick spread on top of the bread. I couldn't taste the chimichurri. Probably because the bone marrow had so much flavor. It was this emulsion of garlicy, umami filled goodness. Eating it by itself would've been too intense, but that's why the bread is there! The last one is the foie gras moco loco. Last time I had it, I fell in love. This time, I fell in like. Breaking that quail egg and letting the yolk ooze through the dish was step #1. Next was gathering each layer and scooping it into the sauce on the bottom. Very Asian tasting but still so good. They donate $1 from each foie gras dish to this organization. Although on the menu, it does say to ask how we can reverse the foie gras ban. I ironically was too fixated on the dish itself to ask, but I'm going to google it! Lastly, but most importantly, the BEERS we got. So good. So refreshing. We got the Session Premium Lager, and Ginga Kogen Beer (Japan). These were recommended by the waiter. The Lager was a big stronger and had more OOMPH, ya know? Not too much oomph. But I really liked it. The Ginga Kogen is a pale ale. Very light and refreshing. Both def quenched my thirst more than the water did. The bill ended up being $83 :|. YUP. I left there still hungry though... so we went to a sushi restaurant afterwards hahaha.

So many reviews for this place, so I'm not sure if I can add much more. This is my third time here and I'm STILL impressed!! Hamachi tostada... so good we ordered another one. It really cleanses the palate since the other foods are quite heavy. Foie Gras Maple BIscuit...yummy, but very rich. Not overly sweet. Sweetbread...love. That's all I can say. Poutine...disappointment. I was so looking forward to having this dish again. In the past, they've always served the oxtail over hominy (reminds me of corn nuts, yum!). Now, they serve is over a big plate of fries. It was like below average diner food. Not sure why they don't do the hominy anymore. Anyway, if you like rich gravy sauce on regular fries, go for it. Tres Leches Cake...yummy. Can't say much since I've never been a big fan of tres leches anything. Service, overall, was great. Hostess is not that nice. Put on a smile, please. I felt like I was bothering her when we checked in. Then I felt even more guilty when we asked if we could be seated at a table away from the door. She gave us that "look" like, "UGH, you're asking too much from me."

One of the best meals I've had in a while.  We were a table of 4, and it was perfect because we were able to share dishes and try many of them.  Definitely make a reservation!!!  (They take reservations exactly 1 month in advance of the date you want to dine.)  The only downside was that even though we made a reservation, we still had to wait 30 minutes. The standout dishes: foie gras biscuit and gravy (rich but so tasty!) foie gras loco moco pig ear with fried egg - the spice and lime juice were perfect to offset the richness of the other two dishes beef tendon chips with pho dip - AMAZING!!  the dip tasted exactly like pho!!   The pork belly sliders were good, but I would try the more interesting & creative dishes on the menu.  The least favorite at the table were the pork ribs. Everything was tasty; you can't go wrong!

I would describe myself as a carnivorous creature and so when I come across a place called Animal that serves unusual animals it was an obvious winning combination. Let's get to the point, here's what we (two people) ordered from their extensive menu: pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg: OK I'd probably get slapped by the chef for saying this but this dish tasted a lot like those chili lime Cheetos. Obviously instead of puffed corn this was made out of crispy fried pig ear but I swear the flavor was extremely similar. Not that this was a bad thing! I love that combination of flavors and this was a very good starter dish. It was just very funny to me. It's worth noting that the egg was cooked perfectly. shrimp & rabbit sausage spring roll, eggplant, sprouts, green curry: And here I go again being that uncouth asshole and comparing this fine dining to fast food but I just can't help it. The meat inside these reminded me of chicken mcnuggets. Not a bad thing! Again, just amusing. Obviously this was more refined and the green curry sauce was complex and spicy and a very nice complement to the meat. Another nice starter. grilled quail, plum char-siu, apple, pear, yogurt: I am such a sucker for quail because I find eating tiny little drumsticks very entertaining. Animal's version of quail was excellent. Perfectly cooked, fantastic sauce, and there is a perfect amount of quail to share between two people (two breasts and two legs). Yum. braised rabbit legs, green beans, matsutake, potato puree, mustard jus: This was hands down my absolute favorite dish. I had no idea rabbits tasted this delicious. These legs tasted a lot like chicken but a much more rich, moist, and flavorful chicken. They were excellent. Cooked to perfection with an AMAZING sauce. I loved them so much I gnawed every last little scrap off the bone. I am sure I disgusted the other patrons. Too bad. Worth it. I wish I had ordered two. flat iron, potato hash, truffle parmesan fondue: This dish was, unfortunately, a complete disappointment. I was rather annoyed with the waiter for suggesting we get this medium rare when really, this kind of steak is just way too tough. If it had been cooked more it might have been a different story but instead, I had to vigorously chew every single mouthful which was just unpleasant. I liked the parmesan sauce on top and the potatoes too but that wasn't enough to redeem it.  Considering how much they charge for this ($28), I would skip it. After consuming four different kinds of animals, we did manage to squeeze in a dessert which was the "berries, vanilla custard, lavender crumble, opal basil". Aside from the basil which I just don't like in sweets, it was very nice way to end a heavy meal. The custard isn't really a custard so much as a sauce underneath a pile of mixed berries and tasty lavender crumble bits and so it was very light and refreshing. I would recommend this. They have a nice wine selection and before you freak at the prices of the bottles on the wine list (nothing was under $100 I swear), they also have wine by the glass as well as carafes. You can also BYOB for a corkage fee of $20. They had some beer too but not a huge selection. Hard core Coke fans will obviously appreciate seeing Mexican Coke. We had five dishes (six with dessert) and that was plenty so choose carefully. The plates aren't so small that you can easily order other stuff. You will get full. They say you can share the plates between two or three people but really it's two. Almost all the portions had everything portioned out to be split equally in two (sorry third wheel). The only real negatives (aside from that overpriced too-tough steak) were that they only have one poor valet guy and we had to wait awhile to get our car picked up. This is just one of those annoying things that they could easily solve by hiring just more guy. It's only $5.50 with validation though so that's cool. Our waiter was a bit smug and pretentious but I can't deny that the service was impeccable, with water always available and clean plates given between courses. Really though the only reason for the four stars was that disappointing steak. I will, however, absolutely 100% come back here and I'll try and be more adventurous and go for the veal brains and sweetbreads. I feel like I missed out. Oh and despite the name, they do have a few vegetable dishes and some fish dishes as well but I doubt a vegetarian would be happy here. Especially if they had to watch me gnawing the meat off of a leg that was once an adorable bunny.

There's no sign outside, probably they don't want a bunch of hungry vegetarians protesting outside. My evening didn't start great, we waited a good 10-15 mins before we just flagged another waiter to take our order.   The bone barrow, ribs and kale salad were delicious!!  We ordered 4 dishes for 2 people and we were sufficiently full.  A little bit pricey for the portion but all is forgiven b/c it was just a solidly yummy meal.

Make reservations at least 3-4 weeks in advance, because if you don't goodluck waiting a good ole 1.5 hours for a suckyass seat the bar. Or try to come at 6pm when they open to get a seat at the bar and beat other people ahead of you. My friend and I came at 6:05 and we were too late! 4 couples beat us to the seats, so we ended up waiting an hour and a half. So we were seated at 7:30pm. There was a table that was open for the whole time and the hostess wasn't even considerate enough to even offer it. We asked why she didn't seat that table, she said someone had a reservations there at 7:15pm and called in late to 7:30pm. At least she could have offered it and said to us "there's going to be a party there at 7:15pm, if you think you can eat fast enough or would like it, or be done by then, then you can sit there" And of course we'll be done by then because we were finished in a hour. We knew what we wanted and my friend's been here before. But no, we didn't even get an offer. We thought that was kind of inefficient. Its a good thing the food here is good. Food: Mostly smaller portions meant to be shared. We got the: 1. grilled baby broccoli, crispy egg, smoked trout, mustard, hatch chili 2. barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw 3. veal sweetbreads, finger lime aioli, cumin, shallot 4. grilled quail, plum char-siu, apple, pear, yogurt 5. bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream The best and everyone should try the pork belly sandwiches, they don't grind the pork belly up, so it's actually just a pork belly burger. It was so fatty and really flavorful. It was our favorite. The Smoked trout with grilled baby broccoli was really good too, the smokiness of the broccoli was just right. They take off the trout's skin and fried it, so it was nice and crunchy. The veal sweetbreads is a good options as well. The grilled quail was a little too small portions for shared, and the dressing on it was not great. It can go without. The dessert was okay, wasn't too sweet or bitter, but wasn't something I'll rave about. Service was decent, place ambiance was dark and crowded, loud, and a small place. Place has no signs on it, so you have to know what you are looking for. Would I come here again? Maybe with reservations for the first seating.

Pulled a good one on the girlfriend for Valentines.  She hates not knowing things and kept on asking where we were going for dinner.  I told her its a surprise, but that I was taking her to a restaurant a lot of people really like and that it was located in a Jewish neighborhood on Fairfax. We turn left onto Fairfax from the westbound lane on Melrose and I tell her that we're almost there. She looks up at a big neon sign and says, "WAIT . . . . your taking me to Canters for Valentines?!?" I said, "Yah. . . over 1300 people have reviewed Canters and it still has an average of 3 1/2 stars." After failing to find metered parking on Fairfax or parking in the surrounding neighborhood, I finally decide to park for $5.50 with the valet in front of a nondescript restaurant with the number 435 on it. We exit the car and she says, "So . . .  we brought this really good Spanish red . . . . so we could have it with a sandwich at Canters?!?" And I tell her, "But Love. . . . Grenache goes really good with pastrami . . ." I start walking towards Canters . . . and being the wonderful girl that she is, she starts walking and puts on a pained smile to try and pretend like she's really looking forward to some pastrami on rye for Valentines.   I laugh, turn her back around and walk her to the front of the nondescript restaurant with just the number 435 on it and say . . . . .  Welcome to Animal . . . She punches me, and calls me a jerk . . .  =) ******************* Baby Kale with Pecorino:   The vinaigrette was tart with a little bit of heat coming from the chili flakes rendering the bitterness that you usually get with kale to a virtual non-existence.  The unexpected flavors were surprisingly good.   Polenta with 6 hour Bolognese:   The polenta was creamy and gritty and topped with a bolognese sauce.  Veal, pork and beef are simmered for 6 hours to make a very savory sauce.  The duo together was amazing.     Beef Marrow with Chimichurri: Easily my favorite dish of the night.  Served with toasted bread to smear the fatty marrow and chimichurri sauce on it.  This paired perfectly with the Spanish Granacha that we brought.  The girlfriend would probably describe it as . . . .  "Heavenly".  I would say that . . . . this MUTHAF@%KA will make your eyes ROLL BACK!     Veal Tongue with Foie Gras:   The Foie Gras was rich and had a full smoky flavor.  The veal tongue was very tasty and tender.  The girlfriend has an aversion to tongue, but this was so good she had a couple of bites. Balsamic Pork Ribs: Came with squash and some type of greens.  The ribs were moist and tender on the inside, with a nice char on the outside.  The flavor was good, but it was a little sweet.  If something is sweet, I usually like to have it balanced out with a little saltiness or to have a spicy kick in it.  This was just sweet. Loco Moco with Foie Gras: I'm a sucker for Loco Moco whenever its on the menu, I'm also a sucker for Foie Gras, so I definitely had to try this.  The hamburger was tender and tasty.  The Foie Gras was creamy with a full flavor.  The rice was cooked perfectly and soaked up the gravy well.  I like the gravy on my loco moco to be savory, but the gravy on this was a little sweet.  Luckily, the spam added a little saltiness to the dish.         So many different arrays of flavors and textures at this restaurant.  Amazing restaurant.  Would've given it 5 stars, but some of the sauces were a little sweet for me.  And I'm not a sweet kind of guy . . . . . I'm A Jerk  ;-)

I have eagerly awaited dining at Animal for quite some time.  It is a unique restaurant that enhances the LA dining scene.  Why only 4 stars then?  Well, I'm stingy about giving 5 stars and I believe in good value. Let me begin with the desserts because that was my favorite part of the meal.  The bacon chocolate crunch bar is to die for!!! Yes, I would come to Animal just to eat this incredible dessert.  It was perfect.  High quality ingredients, just the right blend of textures, and who could go wrong with putting bacon on anything!  The mouse is creamy.  The wafer and nuts give it just the right amount of crunchiness.  And then there was just that perfect touch of bacon.  Well done, Animal. The other dessert was the sticky toffee.  Mind you, I initially objected to ordering this but it's good to be overruled sometimes.  What a surprise.  It was well-balanced.  Just the right amount of sweetness to leave you wanting more.  Another incredible dessert. As for the entrees, they were very good although I kept getting the recurring theme of chimichurri and lime.  While I like my food spicy, it felt a little one dimensional.  Perhaps, we didn't order the right variety because everything we had was flavored similarly. My favorites included the chicken liver toast which was incredibly delicious.  The bone marrow was succulent and luscious.  My only complaint is that it was too small.  I wanted more....a lot more.  But the flavors were spot-on.  An superb dish. We had quite a few other dishes which escape me at the moment but I do recall the Foie Gras Loco Moco.  Interesting dish.  I love, love, love foie gras and this dish tasted great.  However, I just think it's sacrilege to pair foie gras with loco moco.  Seriously, it's just plain wrong.  Loco moco is a traditionally Hawaiian dish with rice, gravy, hamburger meat, and spam.  Granted, very few places make loco moco well and Animal did it justice.  But to pair it foie gras just broke my heart.   Overall, I really enjoyed Animal.  I wish it was a better value but it was definitely innovative in its offerings.

So first and foremost I would like to thank my friends Tracy and John for taking me to this place for my birthday. THANK YOU!! I've been wanting to try this place for a long time now and they actually remembered :) The server said we should order 7-9 dishes (not counting the chicken liver toast) but we ordered 6 and were so full already! Maybe it's our small asian bellies haha or maybe waiting in between dishes really helped. Of course, we checked yelp first to see what we should order :) 1) Chicken liver toast - I really liked this. It's basically pureed chicken liver turned into paste and spread on top of toasted bread. It's definitely different but it reminded me of this one dish my mom makes so I liked it. 2) Hamachi tostada - So fresh and delicious! One of my favorites. The mint/cilantro (not sure which one or both?) made it taste so refreshing. And the fish was fresh and melt in your mouth. 3) Chicken buttermilk bisquits - This was ok. I actually liked the grilled lettuce party better than the actual chicken haha. The sauce kind of tasted like the asian sweet and spicy sauce. 4) Quail -  Super delicious! Very softtttt and tender! Too bad quail is too small haha. It was accompanied by a fruit salad type thing. Seems kind of odd but it actually went well together. 5) Pork ribs - The ribs were so tender and fall off the bone. It came with collard greens but they were super bitter for some reason. 6) Pork belly sandwiches - OMG this was so good. I love love love how they make the bread. I don't know what kind of crack they put in it (probably lots and lots of butter) but the buns were so good, same as at Son of a Gun (same owners as Animal). The coleslaw on top of the pork belly really balanced out the BBQ flavor. The fatty part of the pork belly was nice and crunchy. Yumm fatttt...lol 7) Bacon crunch chocolate bar - I know lots of people are huge fans of this but I don't know, I wasn't that into it. I guess I haven't jumped on the bandwagon of having bacon on dessert items. It also came with salt and pepper ice cream which was odd to me because when I took a bite, it tasted peppery and spicy! Haha maybe I just need to get used to it. Overall, great experience. Would come here again to try other things on the menu!

This place ruled. I've had it bookmarked for about 6 months and didn't make it here BUT once I saw Anthony Bourdain highlight the place on Layover, I had to get off my meat-loving ass and make it happen! I really like everything that we ordered.  The pork belly sliders with a great blend of flavors between the BBQ sauce on the belly and the sauce on the slaw--solid, chicken liver toast--brilliant ($3 too), pig ears with a fried egg on top--very unique (like eating flavorful crispy bacon), bone marrow with chimmichuri sauce--probably the least amazing, but still good (get it for the best Texas toast you've ever had), the tongue with foie gras mousse was my favorite, the bacon chocolate thing for dessert was ok in mho, but my BF loved it.  I would go a different way for dessert next time (I am a chocolate lover too).  Whatever.  It was all beautiful and wonderful tasting. The crowd is cool.  The servers are cooler.  Wine list really needs some help though.  With all the bold meats that they serve they didn't have any bold red wines to compliment them.  I had to settle for their house cab seeing it was the only wine that had enough body for me and it was just ok.  Inexpensive though--bonus. MAKE RESERVATIONS AND YOU MUST DO IT WELL IN ADVANCE.  If you do not follow the command here you will have to get there at least 20 min before it opens and wait outside the locked door so that you are first to get through said door.  You will be directed to sit at the bar and eat there with strangers.  We did this and it was actually cool and worked out well, because the guy working the bar area this night was great!  But there are only 7 seats at the aforementioned bar...so you do the math.  We had about 4 couples behind us. 2 of us...$100.  Not too bad at all for unbelievable food and eh wine.  I will go back and often.

Must order anything with foie gras (maple sausage biscuit gravy?) anything with offal (VEAL BRAINS!!!) Good Wine Anything that sounds really 'Animal-y' is gonna taste really good, assuming you like all kinds of meat, which you must in order to appreciate this restaurant. The desserts are so-so and have no 'wow' factor. An exciting eating experience!!!!!!!!!

"It's rare that I lick my plates clean...." I came here with the highest expectations, which inevitably means disappointment, in most cases; not this time, though. The folks at Animal delivered above and beyond what I could've imagined in my wildest dreams. If there were a culinary equivalent of penis-envy, that's what I felt. Like a blind man who's seeing for the first time. Like a person who's never tasted flavors having his or her first flavor party. It was enlightening... It was a culinary revelation... It was kind of depressing to know that this food is out there and I'd never had it--UNTIL NOW. I'm gonna stick with 5-stars, but a HUGE minus (-) was the fact that we had a 6 o'clock dinner reservation, but the front gate didn't open until about five or ten minutes AFTER six. Mind you, the valet was not out, yet, and it was POURING rain. In short, arriving early meant being stuck outside, in the rain, while the staff lagged. It should go without saying that if you take reservations at 6, you'd damn well better open at 5:45, especially when your customers are already there, standing out in the rain. So, having high expectations AND already being pissed that I was soaking wet prior to even entering the restaurant, plus the fact there were no salt and pepper shakers on the table (my GIANT pet peeve), I expected the evening to fall short... But it didn't, baby birds, oh no... It did not at all. Nor did we need a single extra grain of salt or pepper. That, in and of itself, was a miracle. THE FOOD. What can I possibly write that will allow you to live the experience that is, "Animal"? The answer is: I can't. You simply have to go. It's like these freaks tried EVERY SINGLE fruit, vegetable, fungus, meat, fish, and nasty bit on earth and paired them perfectly. There was not a single dish that wasn't completely "licked" clean. Fingers wiped-up leftover sauces. The usually fibrous tops of root veggies were consumed with an indescribable fervor. Instead of long-winded descriptions, check the pics (they have descriptions of the ingredients), and use the online menu to fill in any information I may have missed. - Mexican Coke. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…)  If you haven't tried this, you haven't tried REAL coke. Funny that Mexico has perfected one of America's iconic products. - Sweetbreads. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) Just a note: These are not brains, they are thymus glands... and believe me, they don't have a strong flavor, at all. This makes 'em like delightful little vehicles for any flavor you desire. Think of the texture as the lovechild of Foie Gras and a tiny scallop (with NO fishy flavor). Amazing. This was up there in the Top 3 of the evening. - Quail. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) I could've eaten three more orders of this. Why I didn't order a couple of 'em to go is beyond me. I think I had already started slippin' into meat shock. The BEST thing of the evening, for me. - Pigs Tails. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) These were like buffalo wings on the tastiest and greatest steroids on Earth. Kind of the cross of a chicken wing and a baby back rib, crispy skin, buffalo & ranch sauces, celery and carrot. If you don't like these, then you don't like puppies. - Foie Gras, Biscuit, and Maple. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) I didn't get a photo of this one, but it was simply marvelous. Almost like pure meat butter. Marrow's tasty, fattier cousin... And in the best way. - Oxtail Poutine. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) Like chili-cheese fries without the associated heart-burn. Oxtail ragu, cheddar "curds," and french fries. A culinary contribution that the Canucks certainly deserve a "thanks" for. - Pig face Croquette. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) My mom swore she wouldn't try it, but almost ate the whole damn thing. If you've never had pork face, you haven't truly lived by the Pork Code. Up there in the Top 3, for sure. - Balsamic Ribs. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) Do I really have to tell you why ribs kick ass? These were a little pedestrian in their prep and presentation, but that sure didn't stop them from tasting freakin' awesome. I could've kissed those bastards in the kitchen. I'll be damned if that wasn't one of the best dinners I've had in recent memory. Do those folks just go home, do a bunch of drugs and come up with brilliant culinary masterpieces? Are they even human?? Well, either way, they truly understand every element of the animals they serve, literally head to tail. A standing ovation for a truly inspiring meal.

What a great place for carnivores!  This place excels on taking a lot of different cuts of meat and putting them together with different ingredients to make delicious dishes.  What a great spot to impress people from out of town! Some pre-dinner recommendations: 1.  Definitely call a week or two ahead as the early night reservations fill up fast! 2.  Also, there isn't much room at the bar to grab a drink if your table isn't ready or you show up early.  I recommend heading to The Dime across the street for a quick drink while you wait, rather than stand outside.  They DO NOT let you go up to the bar and grab a drink if it is full. Animal has a bunch of tapa style meat dishes.  Due to the size of the dishes, you should probably order 5-6 to satisfy the hunger of two people. Some of the food highlights were in no particular order: 1.  Veal Brains-I'm always an adventurous eater and this dish didn't disappoint.  Very tasty and interesting texture. 2.  Skirt Stake-Something tells me that you can't go wrong with a steak at a place called animal.  It was perfectly cooked and seasoned. One of the best of the night! 3.  Poutine Fries with Oxtail Gravy-This is a hefty portion and fills you up quick!  The Oxtail gravy is amazing over the crispy fries. 4.  Avocado and Beet Salad-A nice starter and break from all of the heavy meat you put on your plate.  Light, airy and fresh! 5.  Bacon Chocolate Bar-An amazing way to end the meal.  Not too heavy and the sweet flavors danced over our taste buds. There were a few lowlights, but when I say low lights, I mean mediocre.  They weren't terrible, but just missed the mark. 1.  Grilled Octopus-Lacked some flavor.  Very small portion and it was just okay. 2.  Pork Ribs-Weren't the best ribs that I had.  They seemed just run of the mill and didn't bring anything new and exciting to the table. Overall, the service was great and I would definitely return!  It's much more reasonable priced then you would expect and can't wait to come back!

I'm still full from last night. We ordered mostly the same things I got (and loved) the first time. Only instead of four people, there were three! The other difference is that we ordered the Foie Gras Loco Moco instead of the Foie Gras Terrine, because, as I remember, the former was way too rich. I was actually uncertain about the Loco Moco for the same reason, but at least it seemed to have more diversity (hamburger, spam, quail egg, foie gras, and rice). In photos, this dish just looked ridiculous, like it's name, crazy! I would have never suggested this. It didn't even sound good to me. So glad I bit my tongue when my friend wanted to order it. But what makes this loco moco special is not the foie gras, it's the Carolina Gold rice and the sauce!  The maple syrup, teriyaki, and the Sriracha come together to form the holy trinity of flavor. I swear to god! We ended up canceling the pork belly sliders. That would have killed us. Of course, we had to try the tres leches cake, because dessert is different. It was surprisingly refreshing, not as over-the-top as I imagined. But I still think that after a meal like this something tart is a better complement. Everything else was just as wonderful as I remembered. No reservation, so we sat at the bar.  House wine only $7 a glass. And very nice. I maintain that this is one of the best places in LA. I want to go back already.

Came here with an anniversary dinner with the girlfriend. We both came with big appetites (standard for us) so we ate our way through maybe half of the menu. We ordered a bottle of the house wine which is a great deal for $20. I can't recall the details of the wine, but it's well worth your money. It's a well-rounded red, and I think it might be your best choice considering just how different every menu item is. Chicken Liver Mousse: Really uber delicious. I think chickens were meant to live and die to create this dish. It had just the right amount of that funky, bitter liver flavor and was paired with tart sweet bits. I want MOAR! Foie gras biscuit with maple sausage: Really decadent and tasty, but standard for foie. Enjoy all the foie you can get now before the hippies take it away from you. Kale salad: Not my favorite, but my girlfriend loved it. The greens were a little raw for my taste and I would have preferred them roasted to some degree. Matter of preference here. Pig ears: Chewy, salty and porky, but in a way I hadn't experienced before. I have had the Hunan cold dish version of pig ears that you can get some places, but this was more of a citrusy flavor profile. I dug it. Oxtail fries: From everything I had read, this was the thing to get. It was a bit too much fattassery for me though. Tons of cheese and a pile of crispier than average fries. I love oxtail, but was sad when it was overwhelmed by the cheese. Don't get me wrong, it's delicious in a "Gourmet superbowl party" kind of way. But it just wasn't my thing. The service was great. They have a sense of humor and whimsy about them all. The space is VERY crowded though. The person sitting behind me was probably tired of my butt rubbing on her shoulder every time I got up from the table ... If you can get street parking, do it. Valet was a huge mess that night. The valet guys were working REALLY hard and were very nice, but their system was just a wreck. Great place. I'd love to go back.

This just became my new favorite restaurant. pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg 12 (We had asked which were better, the pig tails or this one, and he immediately suggested this) barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw 13 hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut 15 marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions 10 rabbit loin spring roll, eggplant, sprouts, green curry 14 (least favorite out of the bunch, but still delicious) It's hard to even say which was my favorite. Everything was amazing.. the tostada was great because we had so many heavy things (i.e. pure fat from pork belly, pig ear, and of course, marrow) So it was a nice break to have in between meals. Can't wait to go back annnnnd to try the sister restaurant, Son of a Gun. ****It's a pretty busy place. We couldn't get a reservation until 10 pm on a WEDNESDAY night!

I tried to host my 26th and 28th birthdays here but I ended up cancelling the reservations because the place is so tiny. Instead, I came here with S, a self-proclaimed diva who does not eat dinner after 8pm. With 845pm reservations, he made an exception. The mycophobe (mushroom fearing) tossed out all chanterelle and morel dishes. Our server warned us against starting with a heavy dish so S ordered the hamachi tostada. Did I mention S has never had raw fish before?! He agreed it was light and clean-tasting albeit boring. I was expecting buttery or flavorful fish. Disappointing. Since quail fry wasn't on the night's menu, we ordered Thai BBQ quail because he was won over by the mention of yogurt. It was moist and perfectly cooked but we didn't understand the pairing with greenery, citrus, and the sauces. My most coveted item, the bone marrow exceeded my expectations. While walking to the car, we talked about how we should have ordered two of these. The dish was divine! The last three dishes of the night were sadly disappointing. The pork belly sliders were overwhelmed by BBQ sauce and the size of the pork belly made it difficult to eat. I adore both cheese and chorizo but I simply did not understand the dish that arrived on my table. Why is the chorizo like a pepperoni and why is there salsa hidden in there beneath the cheese? S took one for the team and eat most of this dish. I was so excited for the pork ribs and I have to admit, my dogs ended up eating most of this dish. The glaze was too sweet and the ribs were too tough. They should be tender and fall off of the bone. You know it's a bad sign when your favorite part is the salad. Out of the six dishes, I would be back for the bone marrow (*drool*) or quail. I also heard they also own Son of a Gun so that's definitely a spot I will be bookmarking.

Animal, its quite the beast they say it is. Took me over a month to get a Reservation at this spot. Upon arriving I understood why. It is quite small. The vibe is very hipster chic- so no need to dress up for this spot. It's next door to Canter's Deli. As for the food. I mean it was very tasty but very HEAVY! Lots of butter, cream and fat. We got the Rabbit and Shrimp egg-roll that were just two bites of HEAVEN in a Thai sauce. Then the Bone Marrow, I initially did not want to try this but when I closed my eyes and took a bite of the marrow on the butter covered challah bread I loved it. The Oxtail and fries was also tasty but heavy! All in all, it was great for one time but I could feel my arteries clogging as we paid the bill!

Eating at Animal is the culinary equivalent to having sex with a guy only because he's got a huge member. (Yeah, I said "member." Do you prefer "unit?") Everyone ooh's and ahh's but ultimately, it hurts more than it pleasures you. What's the fun in that? Listen, I'm not afraid of a big (redacted), and I'm sure as heck not terrified by foie gras. You want to slap it on top of your rendition of a moco loco? In the immortal words of Torrance Shipman, "Bring it on!" But if you step up with unseasoned hamburger and soggy rice, just know that you will get laughed out of the game. Overly citrus-y pig ears were terrifying acidic, rendering the crunchy cartilage nearly inedible, even with the poached quail egg on top. Chicken liver toast is, well, exactly what it sounds like - and serviceable here - but hey, it's chicken liver mousse smeared on toast. Jewish grandmothers all over the world have been making this stuff for decades. Buffalo style pig tails were fine, as was the oxtail poutine, but the chips were grainy and verging on cold. Maybe I'm tight - I don't think spending 70$ on a bottle of wine in CALIFORNIA is necessary, and I sure as heck can't handle a 13" the way I used to. I cede the crown to those who can handle big donkey kong and meat-meat-meat. Slow down with all that thrusting and bone marrow. I need some butter for lube and to catch my breath! Maybe I just want to be romanced. Maybe I just need a salad.

"Wow.  Wow.  Wow." The three words uttered by my husband after his 3 bites of the pork belly slider. "That's a f*cking huge piece of foie gras" As he points to the foie gras on top of the biscuit. Yes, those two were the best dishes of the night. The rest: Flat Iron steak?  Cooked unevenly and the truffle sauce was overpowering.  MEH! Lettuce & Beet Salad?  Wonderful.  All the vegetables had a distinct taste and texture. Grilled octopus?  Pass....  It was confusion on a plate.  Wouldn't order again.. Toffee pudding?  Didnt knock my socks off..  would have been better with a scoop of ice cream.. Service?  Our server made us feel rushed which isn't COOL especially when we are prepared to spend good $ here.  I felt like he wanted us to hurry and finish the meal, order dessert, pay the check, and get the f*uck out..   Flip the table, you know, kind of like at a Chinese restaurant...   Yes, I would go back for the 2 dishes we loved and would try a few new ones on the menu.  Hopefully they will be better than the ones we had last night!

I had wanted to try Animal for some time and I finally did and then was back the following weekend!  If you're the non-adventurous type, then it's not the place for you...pig ears, octopus, veal brains and so on are the norm on the menu (FYI, heavy on the pork if you don't eat it).  The way I see it, this is what makes dining out the most fun...trying new foods and bonding over the experience (and lots of wine!).  This isn't your typical restaurant, which is why it's so great! Plates are small, but full of flavor.  My favorites were the hamachi toastado, fois gras biscuits and gravy (a-mazing), baby broccoli, polenta bolognese...actually, I can name about everything that I ate and say it was one of my favorites!  The first time around, we asked our server to pick his favorites and we weren't disappointed.  I was able to try more the second time around because I was with a group of six and everything was delicious! The bar is left for walk-ins.  There is a small outdoor area with heat lamps for you to have some drinks while you wait for your table (beer and wine only).  Simple ambiance, friendly staff, great food. I'll be back.

Wanted to try this place ever since moving to LA, always looking for a restaurant that is looking for creative ways to serve other parts of animals that you don't usually get to taste. Reservations can only be done by calling them after 2pm, which for some, since OpenTable seems like a foreign concept.  Definitely made me realize how much I wanted to eat here. Parking was easy in the side streets (they also offer valet).  We were seated right away, we were placed at the table right at the front entrance, so we did get a little draft of cold air every time the door opened, I would say the positioning wasn't great.  The lighting was dim, the decor minimal just a few animals skulls hanging in frames..I'll leave that up to interpretation. Ordering is done tapas style which our waiter explained very well.  I would order about 2-3 dishes/person in the group.  They do charge for water, which they were very good about refilling, so I felt like I got my 20 cents worth.  The waiter was attentive throughout the meal. Bone Marrow: their signature dish, very delicious, the sauce on top of the very fresh bone marrow was delicious.  The marrow is plated like a spread, coming with these delicious warm toast that you spread the marrow over.  Heaven! Pig ears:  Being Chinese, I already love the protein, it didn't have as much of a crunch as I was expecting, overall okay dish. BBQ pork bellly sandwiches:  The clear winner among the table, the slaw and the tender pork belly went together very well.  Gone in a minute.  Comes with 3 sliders, so if you have a large party, you may need to consider more of these. Hamachi Tostada:  My second favorite of the night, all the seasoning and "herbs"  went together perfectly.  They definitely had some sort of flower in the mix and it was so delicious with the citrus sauce.  I felt like I could've had the dish with only the vegetables. Foie Gras Biscuits:  MY FAV! Another signature dish, reminds me why I love foie gras so much.  The salty and sweet combination of the dish is just to die for. Rabbit Legs:  A great way to end the meal, they cooked the rabbit so the gamey-ness that some people taste with rabbit is gone, very tender, fall of the bone.  The boyfriend liked the mashed potatoes it came with. Dessert: Tres Leche:  Soft and milky, everything you want after a pretty heavy meal. Bacon crunch bar:  I thought I would be blown away by their famous dessert, but to me it was only so-so.  The boyfriend loved it! The bacon crunch was a little too salty and I don't like the salt and pepper ice cream it came with.  Props for creativity! Definitely want to be back to try more of their other dishes, maybe their foie gras loco moco before the protein is banned.

What do I say about this place? My girlfriend has been talking about this place for quite some time now.  I checked out the menu to bring her here for her birthday in November and I was like....What the what?  Ew! No thanks!  The menu looked totally gross to me.  Tongues, brains, bellies...um... nah! Our anniversary came up and she planned the meal outing.  Where are you taking me?  Fondu?  French?  It's a surprise of course!  When we pulled into our parking spot my stomach dropped.  Oh no!  Not that Animal place.  hmmmmmmmmmm. I grit my teeth and smiled.  And, finally after we were seated and had our glass of wine I admitted that I didn't really want to eat at this place but I would be open minded. We started off with the chicken liver.  It was ok.  A lot of times for me it is the texture of things more so than the taste that is hard for me to get past.  The taste was fine.  There was some jelly-like substance on the top that my girlfriend says was some sort of soy paste.  I told her I didn't know what it was. Next we had the foie gras on a biscuit.  It was interesting.  One of the pieces of foie gras was better cooked than the other.  the biscuit and gravy was quite tasty with a bit of a spicy kick to it.  We both admitted had the second piece of fois gras been cooked a bit more thoroughly this would have been the favorite dish.  But, once again it was a bit lacking. Next, was the bbq pork belly and the baby kale salad.  I expected the pork belly sandwich to be shredded but it came in thick slabs but tasty.  The meat itself wasn't extremely flavorful but the bbq sauce was very tasty and the roll that it was on was extremely fresh and delicious warm goodness.   The baby kale salad was super tasty and might have been my favorite.  The lemon chili vinaigrette had a zing to it as well.  Was super tasty.  The bread crumbs added a very nice texture to the salad. All in all - don't bring a vegetarian here. lol.  I don't know how I feel eating somewhere that i don't want to know what is in the dishes out of fear to find out what I am eating.  But, I did promise my girlfriend that I would give it a whirl again.

I'm a fan of Son of A Gun, the other restaurant owned by this group, but stay away from Animal! Horrible service, awful acoustics, bad ambiance, zero decor, and strange food.  Sorry but not interested in veal brains.  The menu is full of pig and strange body parts which I do not eat and they don't post their menu online so you won't know until you get there. Plus they claimed they were booked through the night and they had plenty of seating.  Our "waiter" acted more like a bus buy.  Portions are extremely small. Do yourself a favor: try Son of  a Gun but stay away from this disappointment of a restaurant.

This place deserves a longer more compelling review but I am too lazy. Let me just say that this places ranks as one the most exciting restaurants that I have eaten in over the last few years. It is a stripped down supercar of a restaurant that is all about kick ass flavor, execution and spot-on seasoning. The crispy pig ear was cut beautifully with fresh lime juice, the veal tongue cured with pastrami spices and smoked foie made me laugh it was so good. We had half dozen dishes and they were all remarkable. A bottle of good Rose to start and some dulce de leche cake to finish; this was a great meal. Did I mention that we ate at 12:30 in the morning............? Kitchen closes at 1am on Saturday's - oh boy, I am coming back.

Okay, so when you look at my Yelp profile, I explain I'm not into following hype and will just give my honest opinion in my reviews.  Animal, seriously lives up to their hype, no joke.   The first time I came here I took my other half for his belated birthday.  We both really enjoyed the meal and said we'd come back again with his brother & sis-in-law.  Well, I came back a week and a half ago to take one of my best friends, BJ out for his super belated birthday (like 3 months belated lols). So I'm just going to cut through all the fluff and give you the low down on the show down~ House Chardonnay (bottle) - for the price this is pretty damn decent wine, granted it's not the best ever, but surprisingly tasty. Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - This was the first dish to come out for our meal and, O. M. F. G.   This should have been served last if anything because this set the bar way too high for anything served after it to even compare.  I've had the more pricier loco moco version and that doesn't even match up to this dish.  The buttery foie gras, dense biscuit, salty sausage, creamy gravy and a hint of sweetness from the maple...I can still taste it, and that my friend is what heaven tastes like, for real.  I could order 2 of these and just have that be my meal.  This is most definitely a "Must Order".   Marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions - I had this last time with my boo and we both really liked this pick.  BJ agreed that while this was good, he kind of wished they didn't add so much other stuff on the marrow as it masked the flavor of the marrow somewhat.  Overall this dish is another favorite. Barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw - This one was my boo's favorite dish (but he also never tried the foie gras biscuit, so it's subject to change once he does).  Delicious as I remember, but these little sliders are so deceiving, they might be little, however they hit your stomach like a huge piece of steak.  Very heavy & rich in my opinion, but the flavors are all there.  The only barbeque drenched meat that this barbeque hater loves! Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - Okay, yes this is a 5 star rating, but I have to say that this was not me or BJ's favorite and we both agreed that we could have done without ordering this dish.  Personally the flavors in this dish just didn't stick out to me, maybe because everything else that was served beforehand was exploding with flavor country that this just came off as being blah & muted.  The poutine was good as it stayed nice and crispy under the heavy, oily oxtail gravy, but we barely touched this dish and I made a mental note to skip this item next time.   Overall, this restaurant is one of my favorite spots and I can't wait to go back and try the rest of their dishes.  I don't really think I'm all that adventurous with food, but this place makes me want to try all the plates that one would consider to have "weird meat" like pig tails, veal brains, etc... just because I know that Animal will execute it beautifully.

Worth the wait, worth making reservations, it's not all hype.  Animal is GRRRREAT! Apparently open for a while, I hadn't heard of it until my friend Sung C came to visit me from San Francisco.  Here's what we enjoyed... (from Sung C's review) Hamachi tostada: amazing flavors from great ingredients. fresh and perfect example of a great appetizer. Kale salad: fresh and basic. bread crumbs give such a great texture. Pork belly sandwich: great, great dish. perfectly cooked barbecue + BBQ sauce + slaw = hope you're drooling by now! poutine: my first poutine and it was beyond my expectation! oxtail gravy was such a brilliant addition to the already great dish :) must-try! tres leche: perfection, everything about it was golden. Every bite was special, unique and you picked up on different flavors and notes.  I'll definitely return.  Don't be scared with the name Animal, it's not a game restaurant.

Tasty tapas bites, a bit pricey but well worth it..... I recommend making reservations if you plan on coming here for dinner.  Our party of four decided to just drop in on a Saturday evening around 5 for din din.  We walked in thinking score! bc the place was empty with the exception of two other small parties.  But the hostess said they were booked till 9 because of reservations. However, we were free to sit at the bar. We lucked out since nobody was sitting there, but I think there's only 6 or 7 chairs at the bar?  So make reservations! The menu changes daily.  Basically everything on the menu is tapas size, so mini portions that are perfect for sharing a few bites. They also have unique dishes that use parts of animals that wouldn't usually be served at other places, like veal tongue, bone marrow and the pig's head, tail and ears. Between the four of us we managed to split all of these and walked away happy and full.... *marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions 10- delicious if you like bone marrow *poutine with oxtail gravy & cheddar 18- loved this Canadian fave of french fries drenched in gravy, oxtail meat and cheddar but I would recommend eating this last because it is so rich and heavy.  Supposedly this serves the "biggest" portion of all the dishes. *barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw 13- tasty, two mini sliders *hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut 15- loved.  So light and melts in your mouth. *balsamic pork ribs, delicata squash, arugula, pecan 19- great flavor for the ribs and squash *foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger 35- I thought this was delish but everyone else thought it was a bit salty (I like salty foods eek!) *bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream 7- ok this is what everyone raved about but we weren't really impressed.  Would skip this next time.

This place is really amazing. note that there is no visible sign in front of the restaurant. Look for the Valet stand with the sign that says "Valet for Animal" or whatever valet signs say. I just sat there marveling at the menu, reading through all their crazy ass menu items. it's expensive BUT...the super rich foie gras will definitely fill you up. FOIE GRAS LOCO MOCO. that is all. please order this before the california foie gras ban is put in place. :( we went with one "normal" dish, the pork belly sliders. the waiter said these were really popular but I mean you can get pork belly sliders anywhere. I'd skip this for next time duck neck; i didn't know ducks had enough meat in their necks for us to eat..but yes. they do. it was splendid. i want to try the quail next time

This was a dinner I will remember for a long time!  I am generally suspicious of anywhere with 1,200+ Yelp reviews, but this place totally lived up to the hype. Chicken Liver Toast - Much bigger serving than I expected. Deliciously smooth chicken liver with caramelized onions on top. If you like pate, you will love this. Even my pate-hating husband loved it. Hamachi Tostada - Refreshing.  A little bit awkward to share, if you have more than 2 or 3 in your group, I would order more than one. Foie Gras with Biscuit and Gravy - The clear winner for the evening!  I almost didn't order it, which would have been crazy, considering my love of biscuits and gravy.  The sweet and smokey combination was incredible, and we ate the dish shockingly fast.  Go and order this before the foie gras ban goes into effect! Crispy Pig Ears with a Fried Egg - Delicious! The pig ears were thinly sliced and fried, and surprisingly not fatty at all.  There was some acidity in the dressing, which cut the fat of the egg yolk and the pig ears nicely.   Marrow bone with chimichurri - I expected to love this, but it was our least favorite dish of the evenig. The chimichurri was nice and tart next to the rich marrow, but I almost felt like the marrow needed salt. It was good, I just didn't love it as much as I expected to. The toast served with it was very buttery, and I think I would have preferred a plainer toast, so that the marrow could stand out as the main fat. Oxtail Poutine - I love oxtail, I love french fries, and I love cheese, so. . .this was clearly a hit with me. The french fries were crispy except for those under gravy, but anyone who likes chili cheese fries, carne asada fries, etc. will love this. The aged cheddar was really sharp and stood up to the rich oxtail. Can't wait to go back!

Animal is officially now one of my fave restaurants in LA! Why did it take me so long to come here?! I came here with 6 girl friends for a late dinner (8 PM) on a Thursday night. The place was packed! Ooh and we saw youtube star, Kevjumba dining here with Justin Chon (that one Asian guy from Twilight). HAHA anyways on to what's REALLY important: the sensational FOOD! Among the 7 of us, we ordered a bunch of dishes and shared: 1) pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg 2) grilled baby broccoli, crispy egg, smoked trout, mustard, hatch chili 3) veal tongue, smoked foie gras, pastrami spices, crab apple 4) barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw (2 orders) 5) hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut 6) poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar 7) foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy 8) balsamic pork ribs, delicata squash, arugula, pecan (2 orders) 9) bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream 10) sticky toffee pudding, mascarpone, orange The dishes are kinda small but after ordering and sharing so many, we were pretty full! I would say 10-12 dishes are perfect for a group of 6-7. There wasn't anything I disliked. I genuinely liked every dish I tried but the ones that truly stand out and were AMAZING are the foie gras and veal tongue. My 2 fave dishes of the night. I definitely recommend getting those!! My friends and I were OMG-ing after our first bite of the fois gras. UGH soooo good! How do they do it?! Seriously, you can't come to Animal and leave without trying the foie gras! The pig ear was also delicious! It was a powerful punch of limey and citrusy flavors! I also loved how there was a fried egg on top that you mix with everything. The hamachi tostada is also a GREAT dish to add because it's light, fresh and tasty so it balances out all those rich meaty dishes. Definitely get this one! If you're feeling guilty for ordering too many meats and wanna add a veggie, get the grilled baby broccoli! It's packed with spices and flavors so it's not your average bland broccoli. It's gooood! As for the desserts, I really enjoyed the bacon chocolate crunch bar. The bacon is very subtle so it's not too overpowering but it adds the perfect amount of saltiness to the chocolate. And who can resist that perfect delicate *crunch*?! However, some of my friends liked the sticky toffee pudding better. I am normally a big fan of toffee but I really think this was the weakest dish of the night. Bacon chocolate crunch bar FTW! Don't expect much in terms of decor. It's VERY minimalist which is fine because you can focus even MORE on the amazing food. They don't even have a SIGN outside the restaurant that says "Animal" so it can be pretty hard to find if you don't have a GPS/navi. There's valet parking for $5 or you can find meter parking free after 8 PM. I'll definitely be back!

This place is a solid 4.5 star establishment. I wish I could eat here all the time, but my heart would not be able to take it! Some of my faves from their menu: Pork belly sliders - tender, juicy, salty, fatty goodness! Foie gras agnolotti - it's like liquid, melt-in-your-mouth foie! oh, I will be so sad when they ban this heavenly stuff on July 1st! Branzino - I haven't seen this one on their menu in quite some time, but it is actually quite good. It's a whole fish served on a bed of greens and some kind of polenta which was absolutely delish! Bone marrow - I usually don't really enjoy bone marrow because I find it a bit too fatty, even for me, but the way they serve it is really awesome. The chimichuri sauce really balances well with the fattiness of the marrow. Kanpachi (amberjack) - this has very subtle flavors, and I actually wish they would serve it at the end instead of the beginning of the meal so it will cool off your palate after all the other rich foods. I understand they are trying to build flavors and textures throughout the meal, but I really tend to crave something light and acidic after eating so many rich dishes in a row! Bacon chocolate crunch bar - of course after a few years, I feel as though this is probably one of the most played-out desserts, but Animal's version is still is one of my faves! Oh, and a note about parking - one of my least favorite things about this place is the terrible traffic and parking situation. Leave yourself plenty of time to circle the block several times for street parking. I usually can find street parking within 10 minutes, but that feels like an eternity when you are circling around and around!

My boyfriend and I were here for a friend's birthday. The restaurant is small, so remember to make reservations at least a week ahead, especially if you're planning to come here on a weekend. They have a first-come first-serve bar area, but it fills up fast! My friend explained to me that they also have a "standing area". It's where you stand right next to the bar, so you're basically in line for the next available seat at the bar. I noticed that people are also able to order to-go. We were here about 7pm and I overheard the hostess telling people that the next available table will be at midnight! Whooaa! This place opens till then? Yeah! They don't close till 1am! Being from San Diego, it was rare for me to know of a restaurant that serves foie gras and closes so late! What we ordered: "marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions" $10- It was good, but not the best. The flavoring was a bit too sour for me. "veal brains, vadouvan, apple sauce, carrot" $14 - This was my favorite item that night.  Ewww..brains..gross right? NO! It was extremely tender, the texture reminded me of melted cheese. It was so good, we ordered seconds! "foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger" $35- I really liked the concept of this dish. It was unique! But like Bobby Flay would say, "The foie gras wasn't the star of the dish." They're were just too many types of meats here. I didn't like the spam! "foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy" $24-  The foie gras was was tender and I liked the gravy. If you haven't heard, foie gras will be banned in July 2012! Come here to get your foie gras fix, before it's gone.

Took my girlfriend here for her birthday because we wanted to try a unique dining experience. The restaurant does not have a sign so we walked right past it. The items on the menu were pretty cool because they included things like pig tail, pig head, bone marrow, foie gras and other cool stuff. Makes you feel like an animal ;) We ordered the kale salad which was pretty good. It was quite cheesy and crunchy. The pig's head was very good. I liked the sauce that came with it mmmm it goes good with everything. The bone marrow was pretty good but....its not that special. It was just cooked marrow with onions that you put on two pieces of toast. (although the toast was good). But the pièce de résistance was the pork ribs! Yum the ribs were dark and sweet, the meat fell right off the bones. You get 5 ribs for $19 and it comes with some squash thing with walnuts. Overall, Animal is good...but I'm not sure it is good enough for me to want to continue coming back. However, it's a good experience that won't disappoint.

What's not to like...tapas for grown-ups...had a great Beaux de Provence red at a reasonable price, sweetbreads, bone marrow, rabbit, raw kale salad, BBQ pork belly sliders and foie gras bisquit for dessert...Most of this was peasant food a few years back and now we are paying a fortune... "plus que ca change, plus que ca revient au meme....." serves up right for poo poo'ing this wonderful fare...1300 reviews can't be wrong...Animal is the best food experience I have had since Patxi Basque restaurant in Irun in 1971.

Went here for my hubby's birthday.  We had a 9pm reservation just after arriving in town, and it was packed on a Wednesday night.  It's not labeled but the directions on the website led us there without any problems. Very adventurous!   chicken liver toast: good, had some sort of preserves on top that almost tasted like hoisin sauce.  We ordered 2 but would have done just fine sharing 1 since it was pretty big. crispy pig ear: so interesting, all the flavors mixed well together with the fried egg on top and spicy kick from the chile.  2nd favorite dish. veal tongue: this was my favorite by far, the way every single item on the plate complemented the others.  You just have to try it! poutine: very much "comfort food" and a really large plate.  It was good, especially the gravy, but I'd only recommend for more than 2 people unless you're realllly hungry or not wanting to try a bunch of other plates. crispy rabbit: the rabbit was cooked well and hubby liked the breading but we both agreed the sauce was a little overpowering.  We ended up scraping off the excess. bacon chocolate bar: much smaller than it looks on TV, but dense and rich.  It was good, but my favorite part was the S&P ice cream. It was definitely worth a try, and hubby liked it more than I did but hey, it was his birthday so that's how it should be!  Go with a group so you can try more things on the menu.  There's also a bar in the back and good music/atmosphere to hang out.

I don't always crave chicken liver on toast or veal tongue but when I do, I come to Animal. Such an interesting array of carnivorous options; unadventurous eaters, stay away! Once I got over my initial hesitation towards the unusual animal parts (convincing myself that I've already eaten my share of gizzards and eyeballs in my lifetime consumption of dirty dogs), everything was pretty tasty, though my wallet was definitely limping on the way home.

I have been meaning to try Animal for-ever and finally did - on impulse.  I was thumbing through my bookmarks looking for something new to try for dinner, and Animal leapt out at me. There are a lot of reviews already, so my review's very specific to my experience rather than general comments. Everything on the menu had animal or animal products in it.  (READ: milk or cheese if not actual meat.)  I decided to go balls-out and tackle foods I don't eat every day, and hope they'd be special.  Hence the veal tongue and pig tails.  The hamachi was b/c I wanted something lighter and fresher after beef and pig. What I had: Veal tongue with smoked foie gras, pastrami spices, crab apple 5 stars - my favorite dish ORDER IT Everything was in perfect balance, and worked so well together that I had to swirl everything together onto the fork even though the separate components were artfully arranged on the plate Pig tails, "buffalo style," celery, ranch 4 stars ORDER IT only if you really like buffalo wings and would love to see it elevated to fine dining I thought these were delicious, and might order them again.  I love buffalo wings, but don't find west coast ones to my liking as much as the northeast wings I grew up with. Buffalo sauce - delicious Celery slivers - perfect Ranch - deliciously elevated Pig tails - tasty, texturally chewy and tender at the same time (I like that; some don't) but rather hard to eat (think bone-in) with a knife and fork; definitely a challenge to eat tastefully.  I secretly wanted to pick each piece up and gnaw it, but Animal isn't the kind of place where they deliver your food with 6 napkins and 3 wet-naps, so my enjoyment of them was slightly diminished.... Hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut 3.5 stars NOT A REPEAT ORDER FOR ME Hamachi - delicious Fish sauce vinaigrette - too sweet for me; I expected something sourer/savorier Peanuts - lightly roasted and worked great with the dish Salad/greens - too much volume, seemed like they were just trying to make the dish bigger; threw off balance of the dish for me Also, it's kind of nitpicky, but there was nothing special in the presentation of this dish; after two dishes with stunning presentation, this arrived and looked fairly similar to a tostada I'd get at an average Mexican restaurant. WINE: a 2009 Nebbiolo 2.5 stars It was a 3 star wine, decent but wholly forgettable; but for $16/glass it was a 2 star wine.  I can get a glass of Trefethen cab downtown for the same price.  Hell, I have favorite table wines that run $9-15/bottle that I vastly prefer.   Again, though, it's partly expectation/my personal taste.  They have a fairly small wine list (about 6 whites, 6 reds) so I expected excellence (especially when they start at $14/glass.) Next time, I'm either going to go with the $7 house wine or bring my own ($20 corkage.) SERVICE: 3.5 stars.  I sat at the bar, where, rather oddly, there were sometimes up to 6 people behind the bar (some stationed, some grabbing things here and there) and sometimes NONE.  Twice when I wanted something (another glass of wine, my 3rd dish) I had to wait more than 5 minutes before someone returned to the bar, and more than 10 to get the person's attention.  As a result, I didn't order the 2nd glass of wine. I also ended up having two different servers - 1st half of the meal was a woman; she was ok but not personable or attentive; 2nd half of the meal was a man; he was significantly better, but he was doing too much at once to be really spot-on. Dishes came out with terrible timing - I ordered two dishes to start.  One came out within 15 minutes; the next didn't show for another 20+.  Right before the 2nd dish came, I ordered a 3rd, thinking that if I didn't, I'd wait forever for it.  But the 3rd dish showed up super-fast when I was only about 3 bites into my 2nd dish. One last note: it appeared that whichever staff were stationed behind the bar (sometimes none, sometimes 1, sometimes 2) were expected to dry/polish glassware while they were there.  While I can appreciate the business efficiency in this, it was downright weird to sit and watch it.  In order to ask for something, I had to pull their attention away from their rapid-fire glass polishing. In short, I felt like I was interrupting my server to ask for, well, service.  Again, a minor point, but all of the above made me not want to sit at the bar next time.  Which is weird, because at similar type places, I find the service is often best/quickest/friendliest at the bar. AMBIENCE: Liked the minimal decor and overall feel.  It was loud, but ok. FINAL VERDICT: I'd give the overall experience 3.5 stars.  But the menu did capture my heart enough that I want to go back and experiment with more of it.  Hopefully next time will be even better.  Next time, I'll: 1) sit at a table 2) very carefully consider not only what I order but in what order I order it 3) ask more questions about portion sizes for each dish 4) BYOB!

It's expensive and pretentiously hipsterish, but delicious. Items you must try: chicken liver toast, bbq pork belly sandwiches, shrimp and rabbit sausage spring rolls, and the foie gras with maple gravy over a biscuit. ALL OF THESE ARE DELICIOUS. But don't be fooled - it's not really the carnivore's restaurant. That's that brazilian bbq on La Cienega. Don't bother with the desserts; they're not that great. And the liquor here comes in child-sizes, but it still goes great with the meal.

I'd have to rate this place around 3.5. I wasn't too amazed nor was I completely grossed out. If you are adventurous and aren't afraid to try new things, then I would suggest to give this place a try. In my opinion, there is nothing to rave about. I brought my boyfriend here for this birthday and this is what we tried: - Foie gras biscuit with maple gravy: This was the best dish out of all the ones we tried. The foie gras was perfectly cooked. The sauce was a little too thick for my taste -Chimichuri bone marrow: Although it was very rich, the chimichurri overpowered the bone marrow -Pork belly Sandwiches: Fat sandwiched between two slices of fat. Not only was the pork belly really fatty but so was the delicious buttered croissant like bread they used. I felt my heart pump faster from the fat shock and my arteries start to clog as I swallowed my last bit of this dish - Veal Brain: The taste and texture wasn't bad, I just couldn't get over the fact that I was munching on brains. It was psychologically painful trying to finish off this dish. Very small and hipster-ish restaurant with about 7-9 seats the bar. It was very dimly lit.There is no private parking, so your best bet is street parking or valet. I'm not sure how much the valet is since I was able to find a spot a few blocks down.

Animal is totally meatastic. Contrary to what you might expect, it's not the place to go if you want to gorge on a huge quantities of meat (I'd recommend Salt's Cure, Korean bbq or Brazilian bbq for that). Rather, it's a place that celebrates animal products in all the ways it can be deliciously wrong -- like rich oxtail and cheese over fries, crispy pig ears underneath a runny egg or fatty pork belly in a slider bun. Which is yummy...if not a little TOO rich for my tastes. But definitely a feast to experience at least once!

Really good, really expensive. This is not a complete review.  I guess none are as we don't eat every dish when we go out, but I don't eat all animals.  At least, not the cute ones.  So from personal experience I can say that I really liked the following dishes: chicken liver toast baby kale, pecorino, lemon chili vinaigrette, breadcrumbs grilled quail, plum char-siu, apple, pear, yogurt hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut octopus (not on the site now) The citrus dessert (not currently on the menu) and was lukewarm on: gnocchi that I don't currently see on the menu tres leches, dulce de leche bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream Other people at the table loved the poutine and foie gravy and biscuits, but did not like the sliders as much. At the price, it is good but not mind blowing.  I have been lucky enough to go to many really amazing restaurants recently, and this would not rank up at the top for me, nor would it for my decidedly carnivorous husband or friends.  But it was very, very good.  For the price, though, I'd go elsewhere next time!

Not my cup of tea.  The entire meal was very heavy & rich...I felt a bit disgusting afterwards.  The dishes were all executed well but nothing really stood out for me.

The food at Animal is like sex in the mouth.  The whole experience was phenomenal and well worth the pain of having to make reservations far in advance. ATMOSPHERE: A mix of hipsters, business folks, and families fill up the small bar and restaurant.  The bare floors and fairly bare walls make the place pretty noisy yet the fairly close proximity of the bare wood tables and the shared plate style idea gives it an intimate feel. SERVICE: It's awesome when the busboys and waiters are as interested in the food as the diners and offer thoughts and suggestions.  Everyone was enormously friendly without being overbearing. PRICE: The food here isn't cheap but given the quality it's a great value.  For less than the cost of a nice steak dinner you can try well prepared, interesting dishes.  The one oddity was 20 cents for still water. DRINKS:  Wine and beer only.  We opted to bring our own vino.  Corkage was $20. PETIT BASQUE: Melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread.  The cheese came out boiling hot over a layer of Spanish chorizo and onions.  The dish was really good and would be the perfect fit for any tapas joint. BABY BROCCOLI: Grilled baby broccoli, crispy egg, smoked trout, mustard, hatch chili.  This dish didn't sound particularly exciting but really hit the mark.  Between the mustard and the chimichurri there was a nice spice and tang with the trout adding earthiness and the trout skin adding crunch.  The crispy egg was a lightly coated, deep fried soft centered egg - like a soft boiled version of a scotch egg. RABBIT LEGS: Braised rabbit legs, green beans, matsutake, potato puree, mustard jus.  If you had a French grandma, this would be the dish that she dreamed of making.  The rabbit legs were amazingly moist, like dark meat chicken, and not too gamy.  The mashed potatoes were super rich.  Was it rabbit fat?  Whatever it was it was delish. FOIE GRAS BISCUIT: Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy.  This is the real deal, and something you must try before the California foie gras ban goes into effect on July 2, 2012.  You really can't get any more rich and decadent than this, and the sweet gravy pairs really well with the foie. DESSERT: Berries, vanilla custard, lavender crumble, opal basil; sticky toffee pudding, mascarpone, orange.  The lavender and basil offset the sweet berries and creamy custard perfectly.  A dish I would definitely order again.  The sticky toffee pudding was pretty traditional and not particularly exciting. VALET: The only problem of the whole night was that there was only one valet when we arrived.  The poor guy was running back and forth taking tickets, parking cars, and retrieving cars.  Unfortunately for us, we were stuck on Fairfax behind other cars with the Saturday night traffic honking at us for 10 minutes.  Not a biggie since the food more than made up for the valet issues.

We had great food and service from the folk at Animal, once we were seated that is..... The only reason this restaurant didn't get five stars was that it took over 1 hour 20 mins to get a seat at the bar! There were heaps of empty seats at the bar and tables but one was seated there for the whole time we were there. Also people who arrived after us without reservations were seated first cause they pestered the staff. Pretty disappointing really that such a simple thing, seating people was handled so badly! The sliders were awesome, the duck magnificent and the chocolate, bacon desert amazing!

Ahhhhhhh!!!!.................. sorry caught myself reminiscing about Bone marrow in and around my mouth! ok back to the review, came here a few months ago with friends and we all were in heaven. They have all kinds of delicious animal creations. Atmosphere here is great for a date or for just having dinner with friends. I look forward to my next visit here, I just hope its soon!

Giving this place 5 stars because the service was great (genuinely friendly and not at all stuck up) and the food is very unique and flavorful! Favorites from the night were: CHICKEN LIVER TOAST (we had 2 orders!) and TOFFEE PUDDING CAKE!! Chicken Liver Toast - much larger portion than we thought we'd get! Liver spread on small piece of bread with some sort of sweet onion topping.  Really good mix of salty and sweet! Baby Kale Chips - really well seasoned and it comes with a CRISPY EGG WITH RUNNY YOLK!! Crispy Pork Head - meat flavor is average, but the pieces of picked veggies complement it really well. Pork Ears - crispy, a little spicy and also with a hint of something citrusy. delicious! also comes with a runny egg on top!! Toffee Pudding Cake - realllllllly yummmmmmy! the cake was the perfect amount of dense chewiness and sweetness.  (Even though I was SO FULL by this point, I didn't feel that icky-over-sugared-feeling that you get sometimes when you eat dessert even though you really shouldn't because you're already full) Going to Animal was a last minute decision for a late dinner, when we were trying to find something to eat after leaving The Grove.  So, we didn't have reservations, but the hostesses were super nice about keeping us updated on the seating options and were able to seat us at the bar after maybe 5-10 min.  Once seated at the bar, the bartender was also great and very patient with us as we "mmmmm, ummmm, what would you recommend....?"-ed for a very long time and also gave recommendations on beers. Really want to go back and try the Shrimp and Sausage Spring Roll (they ran out) and the Bone Marrow Toast!!!

Animal, I rave about you to all my friends. I upload your daily menu just for fun. I've had many first here, and now you have me craving bone marrow, oxtail, and quail. Is this normal? Being obsessed with a restaurant? Yes, I credit Animal for the evolution of my taste buds. For my willingness to take more risk, and trying a wide variety of animals that I foolishly thought as being "inedible."   What can I say about the food that hasn't already been stated by previous yelpers? ... The pigtail reminds me of Mexican street food but with a touch of class. Oxtail is decadent, flavorful, sinful, and very filling. Ohhh, and the bone marrow, I shamelessly sip the fat off the bone, soak up its juices with my bread, and keep at it till the bone is clean, dry, and naked. This is what eating is all about. Make reservations if you plan on going during the weekend. If you dine too late, certain plates might no longer be available. Oh, when deciding between the two foie gras dishes, get the one on the biscuit and maple syrup. Trust me! oh, I feel bad for vegetarians.

Phenomenal place! Bone marrow fantastic. Foie GRAS on biscuit w gravy amazing. Lavender crumble with custard and berries delicious. Bacon bar with salt and pepper ice cream something out of Willy Wonkas crazy tasty lab. Very reasonably priced. Came from out of town and can't wait to visit again. It's up there with French Laundry as a very memorable meal.

It was about time I reviewed one of my favorite spots in Los Angeles. An unapologetic tribute to all things... well Animal. This brainchild of Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo is everything it should be. A collection of beautifully executed, often clever, often re-imagined "small" plates centered around all sorts of wonderful cuts, and unexpected (or perfectly expected) animal bits. The most amazing thing about this spot is that the simplest items will likely surprise you, and probably win you over. Take the toast with chicken liver. Probably the most inexpensive item on the menu, and perhaps the highlight of that particular meal. Clean, yet powerful flavors, well seasoned, and presented in quite possibly their simplest form. Head-cheese with pickled veggies was a wonderful play on a reuben sandwich. Flavors were impeccable, and mind-blowingly good. As always, you should leave room for favorites like the delightfully rich poutine with oxtail gravy, and the pork belly sliders. Desserts are also quite good, but I would only try the bacon-chocolate bar once or twice, and then move on to their ridiculously good tres-leches. Yes Animal is always packed, and yes it can get a few decibels too loud in there, but who really cares? (Do avoid going there with a large party). Service is great, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the food is amazing. If ever there was a restaurant that can make me smile time and again, this is it.

Finally got to try Animal after trying for my last three visits to LA-- NOTE: make your reservation well in advance unless you don't mind eating after 9:30, even on weekdays-- and was not disappointed.  Flavors were bold, preparations creative, and the service was warm and relatively knowledgeable (after a quick consult with the kitchen b/c of food allergy stuff).  The food is quite rich, I mean the name of the place is Animal after all, and on the suggestion of our waiter we finished the meal with fresh mint tea which was a perfect touch. The atmosphere is cozy and stylish.  And the prices are good for the quality, in my opinion.

I called about a week in advance and had no trouble getting a 6:15 p.m. reservation.  The bar was already pretty full although there were two seats available if I hadn't made the reservation.  Parking wasn't a problem on the residential street behind the restaurant. My friend and I shared the foie gras biscuit with maple sausage gravy, the barbecue pork belly sandwiches with slaw, the flat iron steak with sunchoke hash and truffle parmesan fondue, and polenta with six-hour bolognese and parmesan. The foie gras biscuit was, indeed, unique and excellent.  The polenta dish was quite rich and tasty.  The pork belly sandwiches were so cute and flavorful.  I liked the way the pork belly had a nice crisp on the outside and the creamy slaw worked well with the sandwich. The flat iron steak was a little overcooked and not out-of-the-ordinary. Animal is definitely a place worth returning to and is worthy of all of its hype and popularity.  Next time, I'd probably try the marrow bone and the pig's ear.

We ate here because it was featured prominently on "The Layover" and we were pretty disappointed. I am a street food lover and lover of food from all cultures and countries.. but this I don't think deserves merit. - - - CONS - - - Everything we ordered was massively masked in lime juice, and I felt like I was going to have a heartburn attack from the acidity and from the deep fried fat content. We had pig ears, pig tails, bone marrow which tasted much more like we were eating a hyped trend for dude bros that don't know their restaurants or what good food really tastes like. + + + PLUSSES + + + However, their pork belly sliders are pretty yum and I would order this again. It's just that their more 'experimental' items are not worth it.. even if just to try to say you did it. Pass please. Our dessert order of Tres Leches gets an A rating and was well portioned for $7 and quite good quality. Overall, their other restaurant son of a gun is better. The wait was not worth it.  I'd recommend going out and trying real foods from real cultures. I mean, we're in L.A.!

I just don't get the hype about this place. 3-hour wait if you don't have reservations. Food is certainly tasty but I felt almost sick from the food because it was so rich. Portions were small, unhealthy, and... just odd in general. I tried all the things people raved about (pork belly sandwiches, foie gras with maple syrup, hamachi tostada, etc.) and I was not really impressed, maybe because I had too high expectations. I could probably get the same type of food in a food truck.

I don't get it...I don't understand the raving reviews on this place.   I've been wanting to check out this place for awhile so when I finally got reservations we were pretty excited.   Maybe I'm not into comfort fatty food and weird animal parts. We ordered what the servers recommended, but still we left disappointed.   veal tongue, smoked foie gras, pastrami spices, crab apple - eehhh it was alright. poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - french fries with oxtail gravy - this was probably my favorite. foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - ick, I guess I wasn't used to sweet gravy. the foie gras was not bad. shrimp & rabbit sausage spring roll, eggplant, sprouts, green curry - not impressed hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut - average bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream - it was alright, the ice cream was quite peppery. minus one star for the rude waiter we had. On the other hand the hostess and waitress were super nice and helpful. We had to try this place once and now we won't have to wonder what's so good about this place because there really wasn't anything great about it....I'm still scratching my head on all these 5 stars reviews.

YUM! My boyfriend took me here on my birthday and boy, was I in for a treat. I love the atmosphere of this place, it's so simple, calm, yet creates this brand new vibe of hipster and coolness. There were a lot of unique items on the menu and I was excited to try them all. 1) Kale - topped with bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. MM MMM good, it was so flavorful yet healthy 2) Crunchy Pig's Head- the meat was fried into a patty and came with ginger pickled vegetables and this delicious horse radish sauce 3) Bone Marrow- this was just alright, I've had better bone marrow at Bacaro LA. I didn't like how it was super gooey instead of creamy. 4) Pork ribs- these were super good. tasted like the ones I've had at lucilles, or other bbq places (that are known for their ribs) I was introduced to Kronenbourg- a pale lager from France. It was so tasty and had a Stella Artois feel to it. I really liked Animal but I don't think the price is worth it. The plates are a bit expensive for the little amount that you get. I believe a one-time visit is essential but any after that isn't ideal.

If you love protein, this is the place to go.  We met a friend and did a few different plates so everyone could try.  I am a less adventurous eater than my friends so I stuck with the pork belly sliders (OMG YUM) but they got the rabbit, bone marrow, braised oxtail poutine and a the veal brains. All in all, we liked it  a lot, will definitely return.  If not for the bacon chocolate crunch bar... that was really amazing with the different textures and mix of salty sweet.

It's been a while.  Two months to be exact.  In the zone, locked in, and compelled to write, so buckle your seat-belts we're in for some turbulence.  Truth be told, I've gone here more than once, however this last experience was one of the best if not the best I have been through for at least the last few centuries, you could say it was a near life experience.  So here's to a very non-awkward and pleasurable evening, the tail end of a whirlwind weekend where in typical fashion, everything got done, but not quite done to excess.  Late reservation, they were so kind as to move us up a bit, and after a sojourn to the bar for glasses of wine we were seated. The seating itself, like the restaurant in general, can best be described as cozy, and it has remained the same for as long as I can remember, and more power to them for it, the urge to not go Vegas with it must be a daunting challenge, but in a world where everything changes with ever-increasing quickness it's nice to find something exactly the same way you last left it.  Within a few minutes, a table became available and the menus were presented on very informal paper, it was almost the consistency of papyrus, which of course means "that which belongs to the house" in ancient Egyptian.  This my friends was the original Kindle e-reader. With the first glass of wine quickly beginning to dissolve the wall between my subconscious, naturally it came time to order another glass and some appetizers, as I have a habit of getting naked and attempting to start the revolution should my food to stomach capacity ratio reach a certain level.  To start things off, they brought out the Grilled Quail, Plum Char-Siu, Apple, Pear and Yogurt.  It goes without saying that this was delicious, the quail was succulent and balanced perfectly with the fruit salad composed into a collection of shapes that I believe was meant to symbolize a microcosm representation of the famous painting "Guernica" by Pablo Picasso. Next up was the Barbeque Pork Belly Sandwiches and Slaw.  Silently, a Portlandia urge began playing through my mind... "I have a question about the pork, about the pork, is it local?  I'm going to ask you one more time, is it local?  How big is the area where the pigs are allowed to roam free?  Do you have a profile of the pig?  Does it have a name? Does it have papers?  Was it a happy pig?  Did it get to run around with other pig friends, had other pig friends to pal around with?"  Snapped back to earth, I managed to utter "Bring. Sandwich. Now. Please."  In mere minutes, there it was, the porn version of food.  Oh god, yes. Next up, in blinding fashion, along with a third glass of wine, this time a red, were the third and fourth dishes, batting cleanup as it were.  The Marrow Bone, Chimichurri and Caramelized Onions were surprisingly good, a personal first for me, as I cannot recall a single instance of eating the marrow of any animal, outside of that time my soccer team crashed in the Andes mountains and we were forced to... No wait, that was a movie I watched on TV, I'm still a marrow virgin until tonight.  And it was good.  Real good.  At this point I was a bit at a loss for words, as I was surprised at just how good this actually tasted together. Finally, the grand finale, the Foie Gras Loco Moco, Quail Egg, Spam and Hamburger.  If this was a fireworks show this would be the part where all hell breaks loose in a fusillade of explosions, only they were happening in my mouth.  Words do not do this dish justice, it truly must be experienced to be understood, like aliens, and cowboys, and aliens and cowboys fighting it out in the southwestern desert with the galaxy up for grabs.  Yeah, it was kind of like that.  I recommend cutting it up into small pieces and taking the whole stack of it at once in your mouth, it will make you question your very existence.  Who am I?  What am I? Embarked on a self-inflicted existential meltdown, on small plates.  I wanted more.  So it was to be one more order of Barbeque Pork Belly Sandwiches and Slaw.  However, I was forced to contemplate the meaning of heaven and hell: I was full.  I felt like Sean Connery in "A Bridge Too Far".  The Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar and S&P Ice Cream appeared divine, but I could do no more.  But I'll be back.  Was it as good for you as it was for me?  This review is officially dedicated to O:), windy weather, the number "5" and the letter "G".  Until next time...

BEWARE!!!!!! I was charged $144.52 for a $120.43 bill. FYI - I paid a cash tip of $25 and marked my credit card receipt with Zero as the tip. I was alerted to this by my bank. They had to issue me a new card as a result of this. My server's name was Jeff. He was caucasian, 5'9", fair with curly medium length brown hair. I think it's possible he altered the receipt to get an additional $24.09. Thankfully I was refunded my money but, I had to call twice to make it happen. Too bad. The food was good. I'll never go there again. Too much of a headache dealing with the bank and being without a card until the new one arrives.

Animal is an evocative name. Touches on the primal need for food and hunting. A blatant reminder that we are what we eat and we should relish that. The small+ plates menu encourages sharing and experimentation. Although it's possible to avoid encountering any animal and/ or animal parts you haven't tried before, I can't promote that sort of behavior.  The dishes are best shared in even numbers, so a party of four is ideal. We consumed: *chicken liver toast *pig face *rabbit and shrimp spring rolls *smoked trout hash with a perfectly runny centred crispy egg *foie gras, biscuit, and maple sausage gravy Although that last dish causes me to swoon, I heartily recommend all the dishes we ordered and shared. For dessert we had the Tres Leches cake. the sticky toffee pudding, and then a second Tres Leches cake call back for good measure once we had a bite of the first.

I love red meat, fatty food, and well-prepared offal dishes, so I was very excited to try Animal's menu.  I also heard about their foie gras loco moco, which I knew I *had* to try before the foie gras ban goes into effect (although I hope they flout the ban at Animal anyway...!).  Overall, it was a great meal - service, menu, and execution deserved five stars. We had dinner reservations earlier in the evening, so the restaurant was relatively empty when we arrived but became packed by 7pm.  Our server was friendly and helpful and the waitstaff was also extremely attentive.  My glass of water never reached the half mark throughout the whole evening and we always had new plates after each course.  I was pleased with the service and overall dining experience. As for the food, we ordered: -Chicken liver toast: nice starter, flavors came together nicely -Pig ear and fried egg: great blend of textures and the chile & lime gave the dish a unique kick -BBQ pork belly sandwiches: probably one of our favorite dishes.  The pork belly was very high quality and prepared perfectly. -Foie gras loco moco: interesting concept and well executed!  This dish combines everything I love (foie gras, Spam, Hawaiian comfort food); it really is loco moco with a twist.  I thought it was really interesting how they altered the traditional ingredients of loco moco and played around with the textures.  Instead of gravy, they used foie gras; instead of a fried egg, they used quail egg; instead of ketchup (which is what I like to use over my regular loco moco), they added a Sriracha-like chile sauce for garnish, etc.  Overall, I was very happy - although I do wish the portion-size were larger. -Balsamic pork ribs: wow, huge portions!  I wasn't expecting so much food because all of the other dishes are considerably smaller. Very tender ribs and I liked the sweetness of the balsamic; however, this is probably the only entree dish that I don't feel the need to order again on a return visit. -Bacon chocolate crunch bar with salt & pepper ice cream: nice dessert, though a bit hard to share between two people.  We were pretty stuffed by the time we got to dessert, so this one isn't necessarily a must-order for me. Overall, I had a great dining experience at Animal.  I was very happy with the dishes we ordered  and my friend agreed that our selections were better than the last time he ate at Animal.  I would recommend Animal if you enjoy this type of menu and are perhaps more used to eating "weird" animal parts.  They have good service and a unique, well-executed menu that is worth checking out.

Such a fun dining experience! We made RSVP a week in advance since the prime dining times are booked early. We were seated promptly and the service was great. The portions are small, so be sure to order a bunch of dishes to try! 1) chicken liver toast 2) marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onion (my favorite one) 3) veal tongue, smoked foie gras, pastrami spices, crab apples 4) hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut 5) grilled quail, plum char-siu, apple, pear, yogurt 6) bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream

Amazing!  As I write this review, I have only visited Animal once, but I will certainly be back for more.  I'm pretty sure I ate at least 3000 calories, but I had such a unique and delicious meal, it was totally worth it. My friend and I ordered and LOVED: Barbeque Pork Belly Sandwiches - My favorite dish so far.  Normally I am turned off my pork belly because it just tastes more like fat than meat and generally has the chewy, slimy texture of fat.  However, Animal cooks their pork belly to perfection.  It is partly charred and crispy on the outside with soft fatty parts for a great textural contrast.  Packed with flavor and perfectly complementary with the slaw. Poutine, Oxtail Gravy, Cheddar - Super heavy and rich but stick to your ribs good!  The cheese has sort of a pungent taste so you might get sick of it after a few bites, but it's a must try and a must share between 2 or more people because one person cannot and should not finish it alone. Foie Gras, Biscuit, Maple Sausage Gravy - Foie gras was perfectly cooked and delicious.  So sad that it will be banned later this year.  The Maple sausage gravy was very rich but not sweet.  Probably should share this one too. JUST OKAY: Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar - Served with salt & pepper ice cream and little piece of bacon fat crystals.  I certainly love the idea and know this was featured on Food Network's The Best Thing I Ever Ate, but I'm just not digging the salty bacon sweet chocolate thing. There is simply no place like Animal.  If you're a meat lover and not scared of exotics cuts or types of meet, this place is a must try.  Stay away, vegetarians! 4.5 stars rounded up.

I love sucking bone marrow from soup bones so when my friend said they wanted to go to Animal for dinner my wallet said no, but my mouth and stomach said yessssssssssssssssss. It was so worth it BTW. We had a lot of dishes and many were recommended by my Yelpers. What can I say that other people haven't already said? The food is creative, ridiculously rich, and quite luxurious. Their plating is beautiful and the flavor profiles are usually a hit. I guess since people write about what they LOVE I'll write about what I didn't love. T H E B A D: If you are a Asian kid that ever nuked a frozen burger and ate it with rice, and egg, and some hot sauce or any combo of the above... DO NOT GET the Foie Gras Loco Moco, Quail egg, Spam, Hamburger FOR $35.00. What a waste of my money. Tasted like something I made as a after school snack in the microwave for my siblings and I. Their Tres Leche dessert gets a BIG FAT PASS. It was too dry with none of the creamy-sogginess of a true Tres Leche. I'm not Latino, but I work with many of them and I eat their homemade desserts and maybe this is a good one, but I don't think so. It was barely sweet & the caramel sauce was pretty, but there was so little of it that it could not save the dessert. Foie Gras with berry and peach preserves. It just tasted like a cold brick of liver was put on a plate with preserves and (yummy) bread. Oh wait that is just what is was! I mean it was rich, but its BORING FOIE GRAS. How is this possible?!! S E R V I C E & A M B I A N C E: Great service, loud atmosphere, fun servers, but its so dim and dreary. I guess in that way its trying to retain its "hole in the wall-secret hide out joint" but you aren't a secret anymore Animal! Bust open a wall and make your store bigger & better so we aren't so cramped! :) M Y F A V E S: Oxtail Poutine: Yummy high quality chilli cheese fries, but who doesn't like that? Potato Angolotti with truffles and cream sauce. I love truffles and would and could eat 3 of these plates. SO F-ing GOOD! Get the Grilled Quail, Plum Char-Siu, Apple, Pear and Yogurt, its small but tasty. Bone Marrow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Foie Gras, Biscuit, Maple Sausage Gravy

AMAZING!..for meat eaters. I went awhile back with some friends and didn't think much of it, but when I went back with my husband I had a completely different experience. Everything we had was phenomenal: hamachi tostada, marrow bone, pig's ear, foie gras biscuit, and flat iron. Our server's recommendations were spot on and he was very attentive I can't wait to go back to try the pig's head. Street parking available if you're lucky, valet for around $7.

I took my hubby here for his birthday last year and it was amazing.  The hubby's not big on food that's overly exotic in terms of animal parts but I managed to get him out of his shell a little bit that night.  We ordered the Veal Brains, Pork Belly Sliders, Poutine, and Bone Marrow on garlic Texas toast.   Veal Brains: This dish was amazing.  It was super creamy and not game-y at all. Pork Belly Sliders:  This was so good I would've ordered another plate if it wasn't for the wait.  The pork belly was perfectly cooked and topped with some slaw for a little bit of acidity and crunch.  I could eat this all day. Poutine: This was actually a bit on the heavy side.  It's basically tender oxtail and gravy on top of fries.  I personally like my fries a bit crunchy so smothered in gravy just isn't my thing.   Bone Marrow:  O. M. G.  I'm a big fan of marrow and when spread on garlicky texas toasts...it's to die for.  They pretty much split the bone in half and serve the marrow still inside the bone.  You shave to scoop out the marrow with your knife and spread them on the toasts yourself.  It's a creative way of serving it. All in all, I think this place is great.  Please note that everything is served tapas style so the portions are a bit smaller.  4 dishes between me and the hubby was fine but we could've eaten more.  Maybe 5 dishes would've been perfect.   I would definitely come back and maybe get my hubby to try some sweetbreads next time.

Came here with a group of 12 people, but we sat at 2 different tables.  It was nice of them to accommodate us. We tried bone marrow, bbq porkbelly sandwiches, grilled quail, flat iron, chicken liver toast. Out of all the dishes, my favorite as the chicken liver toast because they were able to mask the liver taste.  I usually don't like liver, but I could eat this again.  There is a very subtle taste of liver at the end, but it wasn't overwhelming at all.  The bread was okay, slightly burnt.  I can slightly overlook that. The bone marrow was an interesting concept.  That's about it.  Besides the novelty, nothing of this dish stands out.  There is huge variation in how it's cooked.  We had 2 orders of this and one marrow still had some redness while the other marrow was totally white.  This shows how it's not uniformly prepared/cooked.  The chimichurri sauce was definitely not the sauce to go with it because it just added to the already fatty nature of the dish.  I understand using onions and what not, but the dish is incomplete. The porkbelly sandwiches were alright.  The buns were toasted, not burnt. The porkbelly was overcooked.  Too chewy!  Momofuku in NYC has WAY better porkbelly.  I was glad that the slaw wasn't too "watery" or "drippy".   The quail was cooked decently.  It was moist and had tons of flavor.  It was on the sweet side, but I thought it was better than the porkbelly.  At least it wasn't over cooked. Lastly, the flat iron dish, meat was cooked medium rare, cooked to perfection, BUT the melted parmesan over it really ruined the meat for me.  It looked like something you would get at a diner in the south.  Meat with gravey and mashed potatoes placed over the meat. For dessert, we had tres leches.  It was okay.  Not overly sweet and the cake wasn't soggy at all.  I've had some in NY that were really soggy.  This dessert didn't wow me over though. Despite the harsh review about their food, their service was excellent!! Service would be on par with some lower tier upscale restaurants. I am giving it 3 stars mainly because other people have given much higher reviews than I.  I don't think it deserves a 2 star but I wouldn't come back here nor would I recommend it.

Seriously.  Where to start?  I've barely started truly digesting my food and I simply must lay down my review of this joint.   Outstanding!  Granted was there with a group of friends for an exciting birthday but that was just added energy for what most of us knew was going to be a truly different kind of meal.  Once you gaze upon that menu you know you are in for a treat.   Between five of us, we managed to somehow make our way through the majority of the menu at Animal. Our server William (who was fantastic, kind and knowledgeable) assisted in our menu decision, which in turn meant only knocking off maybe 4-5 items of the list.  We ordered everything else.  :)   Animal consists of a great number of dishes perfectly suited for sharing.  What took all of us by surprise was how incredible and well thought out these dishes ended up tasting!!  I am no expert by any means but thankfully adventurous to a certain extent when it comes to food.  But maaaaaaaan!  The ideas of some dishes just seemed far fetched and almost too wild to work.  Yay for being wrong!  Not one dinner dish we were served was bad in taste or execution.  Favorites?  Impossible!  There were entirely too many incredible-delectables passing to us, my friend pointed out, it's  simply too difficult to make a choice!   I do have hands down a biggest surprise moment though.  Veal tongue, smoked foie gras, pastrami spices, crab apple.  I know the menu changes daily, but if they have this when you go, do yourself a favor and try it.  All I can say is holy chit mang!  Delicious!   We finished off the evening with all four desserts.  Told you we went all out!  salt n pepper ice cream?  Uh huh!  Tres leches!  Wow!  Sticky toffee pudding!  I can still taste that one!  :)  Berries, vanilla custard and basil?  Oh my!   Need I say more????  Get ur ass to Animal!  My friends and I have already said how this will be hands down one of the most difficult meals to surpass in taste and quality for a long time!  Happy eats!  -d

Am not a fan of the "nose to tail" / game/ obscure meat trend in foodie places these days, but I will say WOW! Had the quail, the rabbit legs, the halibut, and himachi. All were superbly arranged, presented and flavored. I'm a fan! Would have given it 5 stars but it was freezing cold inside... and the server (clearly an actor) was dressed in "laundry day" jeans and sneakers and frequently looked away from the table while reciting his "script" about the food with an air of total boredom. Not something I expect from a $200 meal.

Had to leave a voicemail for reservations since they barely pick up the phone! But finally got through and went here with an amiga. The place itself is very small and the tables are really close together, no wonder they almost never accept walk ins. The ambiance is very quiet and definitely a good date spot with the dim lit lights. Now onto the real review, the food. Went here based on friends' recommendations and because they serve poutine!!! First dish was the foie gras with maple sausage and gravy, delicious, decadent, and creamy. The richness does linger on the tip of your tongue after for a few minutes. Next up, bone marrow w/ chimichurri, all in all good but a little on the salty side. Then we had the pork belly sliders, quite delicious and the pork belly was very juicy and fell apart in your mouth upon the first bite. For the last course, we had the ox tail poutine, it was quite a letdown because it was just wayyyy too salty and just too rich for our liking. I consider myself a true animal and one that is capable of devouring plates upon plates of food at buffets, kitchens, or hundreds of samplers from Costco but after just 4 dishes from Animal, I could no longer eat. It was if my arteries had clogged up and I felt like I had just ate an anchor, a savory and hearty anchor. Would I go here again? Yes, I still need to try that damn foie gras Moco Loco that I would've ordered had it not been for my fullness and my friend's weak appetite offered no help (Note to self: stop going to pig out spots with skinny, whiny girls). Coolest part of the dinner? Aziz Ansari got seated right in front of us. You know? RAANNNDDDYYY? I wanted to ask him to tell me a joke but I don't think that would've been appropriate...

I've been sitting here for the past hour, trying to regurgitate some fancy-gold leaf-saffron-carrageenan-gel-topped words to express the gastronomical orgasm that was Animal, but to no avail. In a really lengthy sentence, Animal was the execution of pure culinary gumption--it fused the elements of comfort food with an inventive flair, taking each dish to an unpretentious yet exorbitant level of taste and texture. I'll let the pictures speak for themselves: http://www.ferosh.net/20…

I feel like I've been waiting my whole life to indulge in a place like this.. Unique, interesting fare that challenges notions of what food is supposed to be like and provokes one to explore rare combinations of flavors and well, meats, of course! Animal is exciting, inventive and daring, to say the least. So let me get on to the subject at hand... During my last visit here, I went with a party of 6. We had the pleasure of trying the following: - Marrow bone, chimichurri, carmelized onions - how can u go wrong with marrow? The chimichurri was a bit sour, but this dish was wonderful in terms of texture.. The bread had crunch and the marrow spread like butter - Pig tails "buffalo style" with ranch - just like chicken, but pig tails instead.. Lol - Sweetbreads, creamed spinach, brown butter - very rich and decadent, bursting with flavor.. definitely a dish to share - Shrimp and rabbit spring rolls - the rolls themselves were yummy, but the green curry was very spicy.. (and this is coming from a girl who loves her spice!) - Hamachi tostada - delicious and everything went very well together in this dish - pork ribs - good, nothing surprising here - Grilled quail - nicely flavored, but small in portion size.. I guess that shouldn't be surprising with this particular bird.. Lol - Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - ***THE MUST TRY ITEM*** Buttery, mouthwatering goodness smothered in a delicious gravy.. You can't fully appreciate this amazing dish until you've tried it, so get it while you can! - Tres leches, dulce de leche - heaven in a dessert dish! One portion is more than enough for 2 people to share. On a past visit, I also tried the: - Oxtail poutine - this is another delicious dish.. Hearty and complimented perfectly with fries and gooey, melted cheese - Crispy pig ear w/ fried egg - a nice tangy, appetizer that would go well with beer The Cons: - Small dish size - An ambiguous location - no signage, but if you see a black facade with huge glass windows, you've arrived! - Pricey - our bill came out to about $280 - Parking - only street parking available (you can park in the nearby neighborhoods) - Small restaurant size - seating for couples or very small groups is best - Popularity - plan to make reservations weeks to a month in advance because this place fills up quickly! Fortunately, they are open quite late. In short, this is definitely the place to try if you're looking for a culinary adventure. The food is wonderful and at the very least, makes for some interesting conversation! Can't wait to go visit again...

i've been waiting to try this place so was happy when i was able to get a last min reservation the day before i came in.. ordered (in order they came out in): -pig ears w chili, lime and fried egg: the ears were good but wished they were crunchier. the chili was a nice way to start the meal bc the heat was gradual. the lime was a bit too acidic for me and would've liked it taken down a notch. the fried egg was good, but who doesn't love a fried egg?! not this girl.. love runny yolks -marrow bone w chimichurri and caramelized onions: oh what fatty goodness! i wanted more.. -foie gras w biscuit and maple sausage gravy: every component was great. the biscuit was buttery and fluffy. the gravy was perfectly sweet yet savory. the foie was rich and creamy. -bbq pork belly sandwiches w slaw: i'm a sucker for good buns and this didn't disappoint. the pork belly was fantastic. i'm not a big slaw person so i could've done wo it but it had a nice crunch. the sliders are a tiny bit messy, but who cares! let that juice drip down your hands.. -foie gras loco moco (hamburger and spam) w quail egg: the patty was nice and juicy on top of the rice. the spam was good but almost non existent!- thought the slice was too tiny and would've liked a thicker piece.. it is loco moco after all. the egg was good.. again, who doesn't love an egg! i was looking forward to trying the bacon bar but they just ran out! =( the yogurt and custard desserts didn't appeal to me. since i scarfed down an ice cream macaron at milk right before i walked in here i was ok w/o ordering dessert.. looking back i should've just ordered the tres leches.. oh well, i have to come back soon anyway to try the rest of the menu! side notes: -parking can be a hassle, so glad they have valet -decor is minimalist and tables are close to ea other -while i was going over the menu i started to think the place kind of smelled like feet? -make reservations. they have 6-7 seats at the bar for walk ins.. so arrive when they open or later in the night for a better chance to get seated right away

I've been holding off on writing a review for this place because let's face it, I'm one of the few who came out of this place a bit disappointed. I found this place a year ago while browsing yelp and it had everything that I would dream for in a restaurant. The savory, innovative, and somewhat different type of dining experience. This place is always booked and you have to book a reservation daysss in advance. One weeknight, we were able to get a reservation at about 9:30pm. It was a late dinner but we booked it anyways because I was sooo sure it would totally be worth the wait. I loved the feel of the restaurant. It was more simple, rustic, and I loved that about it. The place was definitely bustlin' and I was excited to get started with our meal. Sunny L. and I had a bottle of wine and ordered everything all the yelpers were raving about. Foie Gras Biscuit And Maple Sausage Gravy, Chicken Liver Toast, Bone Marrow with Chimichurri (THIS WAS REALLY GOOD), Pig Ear with Fried Egg, and bacon chocolate crunch bar. The size of the plates are perfect and gives you the opportunity to taste everything on the menu. I'm not one who is new or scared to try different types of food and animal parts. However, I did feel like Animal was way too flavorful for me. It was overly salty, overly creamy, and just over the top in flavor and not in a good way. I guess you can say I feel like simple is more and that was especially the case for Animal. I like how Animal showcases different parts of the animal that a lot of Americans are scared to try. Overall, I'm glad I got to finally try this place!

Animal is next level. I've been a bit off-put by meat lately. Likely the result of too many Netflix documentaries but some friends recommended Animal and I didn't want to be the weird semi-vegetarian-sometimes pescatarian person in the group so I agreed to check it out. My favorite was the polenta, six-hour bolognese. I've been dreaming about this stuff. Other must tries are the barbeque pork belly sandwiches with slaw, grilled quail and the foie gras on a biscuit with maple syrup gravy. As a disclaimer I had one small bite of the foie gras because I kept thinking about baby ducks with swollen livers but I digress... I wasn't a huge fan of the bacon chocolate crunch bar. Really this type of combo should leave you in a semi-conscious chow-coma. Fail. Anyway, this is a great place for foodies that have eaten themselves through a majority of the City's great restaurants. Will give you a fresh take on being a carnivore.

What a perfect place to go during the Halloween season! I first heard about this place through the Food network show "The Best thing I ever ate: Frightfully Good episode." Their pig's tail dish was featured and let me say that it didn't look like something I would try. After I saw the high rating for this place on Yelp....then I felt like it was a place I had to try before Halloween was over. My friend & I came to this place with a very open mind. Thinking we were going to see the weird combinations of food with the most unlikely style of meat. This place does take the phase of using every piece of the animal to another level! (SO I guess it isn't all going into hot dogs anymore? LOL) Ahh....the Pigs tail. I just had to try it after seeing it on TV. So my friend and I ordered it. These pigs' tails ($11) are treated like regular buffalo wings by going through the same process like they would with chicken wings. I tried it and it wasn't bad at all. It was very tender, and better then any chicken wings I ever had. My friend ordered the veal brain ($14). I didn't think it looked good enough for me to even try it, but my friend seemed to love it. He ate the whole thing, and just turned to me & said, "Its better then the pig's tail." I ordered something "normal" and got the BBQ pork sandwich ($13). OMG! It was one of the best pork I ever had. I believe that the sauce was also homemade. Boy this place is a perfect place to go during Halloween. Even if it isn't Halloween, I think I would try this place at least once. The portions are TINY, but it has massive flavor and will have your tastes buds singing. Go with a open mind, and you won't be sorry.

Here's is the breakdown Service: The hostess was very rude on the phone number one. When I came in I was seated by the bus boy? My waitress was polite but very rushed. Would not help me find something on the menu that was less unadventurous. Location and Atmosphere: Also Animal is impossible to find at night. Can you be more brown colored on the outside? I walk inside on a wednesday night no one is at the front desk and reallly packed. Its too packed to the point where its kinda unpleasant. Finally orfer my food. I actually came for the tres leches and im excited to try but since i havent eaten im kind of hungry so i get the pork belly sandwich. Food: Pork Belly Sandwich, delicious, very tasty, but not as good as Forage in Silverlake. Tres Leches was good, not extremely good. Would I go back? Probably not.

I still remember my chocolate bacon heath bar I had for dessert. I don't know how else to describe the awesomeness of this place, except that if you like Pork and more Pork, and southern food that's been hipsterized, you'll love this place.

This place is amazing. We ordered the chicken liver toast, pork sliders, and foie gras with biscuit and gravy. At first, when our food came, I was nervous because the portions here are tiny, but it ended up being just enough. I don't eat that much, though. For a typical couple, I'd recommend 1-2 small plates, 3 medium plates (the menu is not divided into appetizers and main courses), and a dessert. Here's the break down of what we ate: Chicken liver toast - This was delicious to me, but for some reason, the boy didn't like them. Pork sliders - This is one of those must tries if it's your first time at animal. I have to say, the pork is amazing. It's incredibly flavorful, with the perfect combination of crispy and tender textures. I was actually kind of sad that they put barbecue sauce on the sliders. I just wanted a big slab of pork with nothing else. Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - Oh my god. This dish is a plate of orgasm, I kid you not. The sauce is sweet from the maple sausage with a kick of spice that hits you at the end of a bite. the biscuit is soo buttery it melts in your mouth. And the foie gras? no words can justify it. Of course, we had to finish off with dessert. We decided to go for the bacon chocolate crunch bar since it was our first time here. I was a little skeptical about the salt and pepper ice cream at first, but it won me over with its unique flavor. The bar itself was alright. Frankly, I wasn't loving the combination of bacon and chocolate. Overall, it's a dessert worth trying, but it didn't blow me out of the water. Summary: get your butt to animal because the hype is real!

The mecca to which every carnivore must make journey to during their dining existence.  It is a gluttonous experience that will keep you ordering sides of bread to sop up the decadent sauces which accompanies each plate of their extremely creative, incredibly rich offerings. Eat your heart our Lucky Charms, this is magically delicious defined. The menu changes often, but the must trys are the mainstays such as: Oxtail Poutine, BBQ Pork Belly Sandwiches, and Marrow bone.  Of course, there is also the infamous "Foie Gras Loco Moco",  topped with spam, hamburger, tons of gravy and a quail egg to top it off.   Of course, it's too much, but you couldn't have it any other way.   The desserts are pretty solid as well. The Tres Leches was my favorite, with the other much lauded Bacon Chocolate Crunch running a close 2nd. Only slight comment seemed inconsistently cooked (burnt bacon) the several times I've ordered it. Definitely a dining experience which will stay in your memory (and your arteries) for a while.  Make a reservation early, as the restaurant houses a tiny 43 seats, and the buzz has only downed slightly since it's opening. Bring your appetite and more than a few friends in order to maximize the tasting of Animal's fab four-legged fare. Yum!

Animal has some crazy combination of ingredients packed in their dishes that truly confuses one's taste buds for the good. Located near Fairfax and Beverly this place doesn't have a prominent sign that yells out "Animal." Instead a discrete little address is all one will see; usually showcasing many people outside the store's front.  This place tends to be really packed so reservations are a must. Moreover, due to the funky combinations price per plate tend to be on the expensive side at least for the usual Joe. This place is highly rated by Yelpers while having as astonishing amount of reviews - 1,148 total. I came here with a friend after a photo shoot. We only got desserts, so this review is just based on the desserts we had and they did not disappoint. We ended up getting the bacon chocolate crunch bar with ice cream (4.5) and the berries, vanilla custard, lavender crumble and opal basil (4/5).

I took my girlfriend here for our 11 month anniversary and, wait for it, I didn't make a reservation. I'm the best boyfriend ever, I know. So we waited it out and we got seated at the bar after about 20 minutes. Here's what we ordered: Gina Kogen Silver $9 Marrow Bone, Chimichurri, Caramelized Onions $10 Rabbit Loin Spring Roll, Eggplant, Sprouts, Green Curry $14 Coconut Sweetbreads, Raita, Mango, Tamarind $15 Poutine, Oxtail Gravy, Cheddar $18 Balsamic Pork Ribs, Delicata Squash, Arugula, Pecan $19 Foie Gras, Biscuit, Maple Sausage Gravy $24 Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar $7 The Good: The service is obviously stellar. Considering I'm paying in my flesh and ball sack, you would expect that from a fine establishment like this. The Gina Kogen Silver Japanese beer was recommended and it did not disappoint. It was a very clean and full bodied beer with a pleasant aftertaste. The Poutine, Oxtail Gravy, Cheddar was simple, but very filling and hearty. The meaty oxtail is reminiscent of beef brisket and went well with the starch from the French fries. I could do without the pungent cheddar. The Balsamic Pork Ribs, Delicata Squash, Arugula, Pecan had meat that was literally falling off the bone. I was really full at this point, but I enjoyed the juicy and full texture of the meat so I kept eating. The balsamic sauce they used was slightly too sour to be really enjoyable. The squash was sweet and warm. I'm not much of a fan for arugula and I definitely don't remember any pecan. The Foie Gras, Biscuit, Maple Sausage Gravy WAS A CONCOCTION MADE IN HEAVEN. The rich softness of the foie gras mesmerized the senses of my tongue. I'm very fond of liver's taste and it was only beautifully amplified by the buttery flaky biscuit and sweet gooey magic of the maple sausage. Hands down the best dish of the entire night. The Bad: The Bone Marrow, Chimichurri, Caramelized Onions was not particularly bad, but it was only serviceable. They serve it with 2 big slices of garlic bread or something. Aside from the greasy richness of the marrow, it didn't really taste like anything. The Rabbit Loin Spring Roll, Eggplant, Sprouts, Green Curry was happily enjoyed by my girlfriend, but it was throw away for me. Rabbit reminds me of a more tender gummier chicken. I will admit that green curry sauce was exotic. The Ugly: I have two words to describe the Coconut Sweetbreads, Raita, Mango, Tamarind: Popcorn Shrimp. Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar should have been called the Bacon Hyped Disappointment. The Verdict: $126.15 later before tip and I can say that I won't be back either until I pass part one of my national boards or I'm a dentist. Considering there is going to be a ban on foie gras in California, I'm all right with never coming back.

Went to Animal on a Friday night at 10:30. After scoping the minimal decor, I knew I was in a place that meant business. Prior to arriving, my girlfriend, best friend and his lady and I decided that we would be using the divide and conquer feasting style. My girlfriend is not one that goes out looking odd things to eat, but participated in everything we tried. That said, we attacked the following items: - chicken liver toast; - marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions; - pig tails, "buffalo style," celery, ranch; - pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg; - barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw - hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut; - foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy; - flat iron, potato hash, truffle parmesan fondue; - tres leches, dulce de leche; and - bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream. Of the items, the hamachi tostada and deserts were the least memorable. Not bad, but not anything spectacular. These menu items appear to be there as "safe" choices for those who are whining about having to eat tails, organ meats, bellies, ect. The entire group really liked the treatment of the chicken liver toast, the balsamic reduction and crusty bread were very good. While my team enjoyed the marrow bone, my friend's team prefers a simple preparation of the bone without the chimichurri. They still enjoyed it though - after all, it's like meat flavored butter! The boys liked the pig tails and pork belly sandwiches a bit more than the ladies. He nominated the pork bellies as one of his favorites. The tails were nothing fancy, seemed like Frank's Red Hot, but I love Frank's and they were cooked perfectly. Slaw with pork is always a plus in my book, and the buns complemented the pair well. We all thought the fried pig ear strips with the fried egg topper were fantastic and unexpected. Good crunch, a bit spicy, and creaminess from the egg. Wish I could recreate this one at home. The stars in my book were the foie gras and flat iron. Again, both were cooked perfectly, with the steak drawing praises from my girlfriend who normally does not enjoy rare-ish meat.  The flavor profiles of both dishes were simple and enjoyable. We did not find the maple sausage gravy too sweet as some others have commented. We have decided that we will make the trek back from Orange County a few times a year.

Came in on Valentine's Day. Our reservation was at 9:30pm but we arrived early and they promptly sat us. We ordered the chicken liver toast which I didnt like but BF thought was yummy. Next up was the veal tonguew w/smoked foie gras, pastrami spices andcrab apple which was awesome. We also ordered 2 dishes which was my all time favorite. The pig ears w/chili, lime, fried egg and wild sturgeon, harissa aioli and kabocha squash. Both was just sooo incredible. The ingredients really completed each other. YUM! For dessert we got the berries w/vanilla custard, lavender crumble, opal basil. A truly awesome dessert to finish the nite. All in all a great Valentine's Day dinner.

I finally got a chance to eat here, and I must say, I am extremely happy that I did. Small venue, and I actually walked past it without realizing it, then doubled back.  The place is small and cozy, but it isn't a sardine can either.  You definitely need to call ahead for a reservation, or if you get there early enough, you can lock down a spot at the bar (which we did). We had the following items: -baby kale, pecorino, lemon chili vinaigrette, breadcrumbs -polenta, six-hour bolognese, parmesan -barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw -shrimp & rabbit sausage spring roll, eggplant, sprouts, green curry -flat iron, potato hash, truffle parmesan fondue -tres leches, dulce de leche The pork belly sliders are insanely delicious.  we actually ordered it twice!  It was my clear favorite, and I could've eaten that all day.  the flavors of each item were vibrant, and each dish stood apart from the other.  Normally, for me, food that is rich on the palette halts my appetite fast, but not this time!  The kale dish was a nice light start too, whet the appetite but didn't fill you up too quickly. It's on the pricey side, but definitely worth it.  I have not eaten anything like what they serve here, so, I was quite satisfied all around. They don't have vegetarian options, so, you might want to choose another place if you have vegetarians/vegans in your party.

A great place to eat in LA!!! Their food is outstanding and I also like their ambiance a lot as it's not the usual LA hipster environment but very down to earth and casual. We had a good selection of their dishes and all of them tasted great (a few pictures can be found at http://www.flickr.com/ph…) The favorite dishes of the night had been the Hamachi, Foie Gras, Balsamic Pork Ribs. Some of the dishes sounds strange on the menu (like Foie Gras with Biscuit) but they all work very well . Trust me ! Only slight let down is their wine/cocktail list . But not something which would stop me from coming back. One of the must see/eat spots in LA

This place is so good! My boyfriend wanted to take me somewhere cool on our way down to San Diego. He had read some reviews, thought it looked promising and it was! Ambiance is cozy, food delicious and service was great! We had an excellent time and I can see this being a really good place for a date. We had the following: Foie Gras with biscuit and maple sausage gravy, pork belly sliders, polenta with bolognese, and pig ear with chill, lime and fried egg. We each beers for drinks. Foie gras with biscuit and maple sausage: DELICIOUS! So creamy; it just melted in your mouth. The gravy wasn't too overpowering, and you got just the slightest hint of smoky sausage. I was worried the maple would be too standout, but it was just enough to add depth to the gravy. Polenta with 6 hour bolognese: COMFORT FOOD. For real. It would be perfect for any cold winter day. The bolognese wasn't greasy, or fatty, had the perfect amount of tomato flavor and the polenta was delicious. Not plain or boring like it sometimes can be. Pork belly sliders: OMG this was good! I personally love pulled pork sliders, and this made it that much better. I'm not a huge fan of cole slaw, but this wasn't too tangy or creamy or anything. Just the perfect amount. We were practically licking the plate after. The sauce was more Carolina-style BBQ sauce, so the vinegary taste was awesome! Pig ear with chili, lime and fried egg: To me, after a hard day at work, or just bad day, I would want that with rice and whatever Real Housewives was on. The pig ear was crunchy and salty, the chili and lime adding the tang and acid needed and the fried egg making it creamy and delicious. Overall, fantastic experience. Our server/bartender was incredibly helpful, very attentive, and entertaining. Check it out!

Wow! What an interesting dining experience!! What we ordered (for 2): Chicken Liver Toast - Great portion/ flavor balance between the chicken liver and the toast.  Liver was not too overpowering. Buffalo Style Pig's Tail - Great sauce on top of perfectly cooked pig's tail. Foi Gras Biscuit with Maple Gravy - OMG! So good!  This was my favorite!  The combination of sweet and savory flavors was like having a surprise party in your mouth! BBQ Pork Belly Sandwich - Not out of the ball park fantastic, but better than most.  The pork was very tender and flavorful. Poutine Ox Tail Gravy - A little on the salty side for my taste, but very flavorful. Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar - Amazing!!!  So rich, but so good!  Definitely a must!!! Make sure you make a reservation a few days in advance and enjoy every bite!!

I am probably the only person who is not a fan of animal.  Maybe it's all the hype but this restaurant did not hit the spot for me.  I was disappointed in the items I chose....1) Poutine - it was very much similar to the Canadian thing without the actual chunks of meat but it was lacking in the gravy.  To me, poutine is suppose to be drenched in gravy but too many fries were left undressed.  2) flat iron - probably one of hte worst steaks I have ever had in my life, the parmesan fondue topping, for me, did nothing to add to the flavoring, instead it gave the whole steak a weird texture.  As for the steak, it was flavorless and overcooked (at least the half that I had)   So why did I give it a 3 star you say?  That's because there were other items that were ordered that tasted pretty good - polenta, tandoori octopus (very well cooked and seasoned), smoked foie gras that went with the veal tongue....so in conclusion, if you are a fan of the parts of the animal other than the mean - foie gras, ears, etc...they are done well but for the usual stuff, don't bother!  If you are not an equal opportunity eater, this may not be the place for you.

Wow, I'm so impressed!  This was one of the best meals ever.  I've had this place bookmarked for the longest due to the # of reviews and all the high ratings but I just wasn't in a rush to eat Animal - parts.  I'm so glad my besties brought me here for my bday. Chicken Liver Toast: Very rich and creamy.  The liver was strong and it started to get a bit overwhelming.  However, when I got to the balsamic shallot jam part, the problem went away.  The jam was sweet and helped mellow out intensity of the liver.  Next time I will spread the jam out so I can get some in every bite.  The toast was nice, thick and chewy.  Yum!  Great deal for $3! Pig Ear: The lime was damn strong but it went really well with the crispy pig ears.  This dish felt very snacky. BBQ Pork Belly Sandwiches: Amazing!  I'm still thinking about how delicious it was.  It was rich and fatty (in a good way) and it was very flavorful and very enjoyable to eat. Hamachi Tostada: I love this dish.  I can eat it all by myself.  It was very light and it had great flavors.  The fish sauce was wonderful and went really well with the slaw and the crispy fried onions.  This was a very crunchy dish! Poutine: I think my besties enjoyed this one more than I did.  It was good but it was very heavy!  This dish was savory and the oxtail was very tender, however, I felt that the cheese didn't really do much. Foie Gras, Biscuit, Maple Sausage Gravy: I think that the portion of this dish was just perfect.  If it was any bigger, the sweetness would be a little overbearing.  This dish was really good and it was the best Foie I've had in a while.  The gravy was sweet and rich and yummy! Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar, S&P Ice Cream: The weakest dish of the night.  I did not enjoy this at all.  I barely tasted any bacon and any that I did was bitter.  I didn't get any of that luscious salty chocolaty creamy goodness that I was expecting.  I didn't care for the salt & pepper ice cream.     Tres Leches: OMG, this was so freaking delicious!  We should have gotten 2 of these instead!  This cake was incredibly moist without being too dense.  It was sweet and very decadent.  I'm in heaven. I'm definitely coming here again before year end to try the Foie Gras Loco Moco and the Foie Terrine.  It's getting banned in California in 2012!!!

Overpriced, overrated, TOTALLY and DEFINITELY UNDERWHELMING! I have waited quite awhile for a special occasion to come to this place to try. I felt bad, because I felt like this wasn't good enough for my friend's birthday that we came to celebrate. We had 7 dishes including dessert...all but ONE was disappointing in every way possible. Potato Angolotti - Fancy name, sounds fancy and creative..but it was just a mash potato ravioli... Pork Belly Sandwich - Great flavour and crisp...but get out of town, these should be called  "slightly" bigger SLIDERS. Quail Something - So unforgettable that I don't even remember the name...it's quail with a bed of freaken fruit salad..you are better off with Chinese Squab Oxtail Poutine - If you have been to any Chinese restaurant...seriously, Animal has just given Oxtail a horrible reputation - Flavour was OVERLY pungent! Marrow Bone with Chimichurri - Nothing special, you can get this elsewhere...and seriously 2 pieces of TOAST?! Foie Gras Loco Moco - $35..and it tastes like Indian Fried Rice from the many Chinese cafes around San Gabriel Valley. THE MOST DISAPPOINTING DISH OF ALL TIME...YES OF ALL TIME.. The Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar with S&P Ice Cream.. Sounds delicious and ambitious...but HELL was this the worst tasting dessert I have had to date! First off...it isn't even a bar...it's a SLIVER...I rather have a Snicker's Bar...and don't freaken call it S&P Ice Cream when it's not even Vanilla Ice Cream...the only reason we finished it was because it was $7... The service was another story...should've not tipped at all and just gave it all to the bus boy who was the most attentive and welcoming person of the whole night. I do not enjoy snobby hostesses who believes that checking facebook is more important than greeting their guests and a waitress who gave off the vibe like she knows everything and is better than you... my friend/birthday girl got hit at least 10 times and they just looked at her and didn't even apologise..RUDE RUDE RUDE~! Animal needs to fire their super unwelcoming / unfriendly staff... OVERALL....THE MOST OVERRATED RESTAURANT EVER! and no, of course, I will not go back!

Definitely go and when making the res, ask for a non-booth table.  The booth tables are way too close and difficult to have a conversation.  Here's what we had: Hamachi Tostada - hamachi on a crispy tostada with tangy greens and roasted peanuts.  This was my favorite of the night! Rabbit & Shrimp Spring Rolls - spring rolls on a bed of greens and curry sauce.  Was my husband's fave dish! Bay Kale Salad - chopped salad with a citruis chili dressing.  Was good, not great. Marrow Bone -  served with chimichurri sauce and carmelized onions.  two thick toasts to spread it on.  Yum!   Foie Gras Loco Moco Hamburger - Niman Ranch hamburger, spam, foie gras and fried quail egg all on a bed of golden rice.  Delish but $35 is a lot of dough for this small portion. For dinner, we shared the bacon chocolate crunch bar.  It was delicious although we didn't really taste the bacon.  The salt & pepper ice cream was good but it tasted like vanilla bean flavor to me.

The balls of this restaurateur.  Being located in Cali and spitting in the face of "eco conscious diners".  Its the Jolt cola of the restaurant world, filled with paradoxes An example, there are no real vegetarian options but the produce they use to accompany the dishes is organic.  In fact, vegetarians won't find a satisfying meal here and may even be insulted by the menu alone (not just veal but veal brains).   The food is inventive and uses unique ingredients creating flavors that are unexpected. The bone marrow with chimichurri is incredibly unctuous.  Spread the melt in your mouth, creamy marrow on some toast for some textural contrast and you're in foodie heaven.  The crispy rabbit legs, near perfect.  Succulent pieces of rabbit served with a tart lemon aioli that brings out the unique gamy taste of the rabbit. (at least you know its not chicken). Finally, the BEST LOCO MOCO (easily blowing away any in Hawaii; its birth place).  Seasoned rice (not quite fried rice), topped with a burger, spam, thick piece of pan roasted foie, all topped with a sunny side up quail egg.  The fat from the foie soaks everything and is the ultimate brown gravy.  Take a knife, cut it apart, mix it up and you're in heaven. Continuing with the unexpected, the selection of wines by the glass is excellent, creative, and extremely well chosen with a lack of emphasis on new world wines.  Prices are good. Service is excellent. Some might say "you're an animal" for recommending this place.  So be it.  Highly recommended.

I'm a lucky duckling who has an amazing friend who was able to get the foie gras reservation after we were both trying to call for hours to get thru. I hadn't been to Animal prior and not by choice, so I was grateful when I had the chance. The place is TINY and dark and I'm not too sure about their regular menu but I was blown away during the Chef Ludo 2 day event. This review isn't for their normal business so I apologize, but I will say this, if they have another foie gras event, it's a MUST GO!

These are one of those places where you get a tiny portion for a a hefty price but the flavors and textures are amazing to taste. At least it's more food than The Bazaar! It's very minimal decor when you enter but this a great place to taste wacky foods. I wasn't a fan of the bacon chocolate crunch bar... it comes with a side of pepper ice cream and the flavors were just not melding well. The chicken liver toast was salty but delicious. I also tried the quail, rabbit, etc. Think delicious foams and creamy, flavorful sauces and colors on the plate.

Call me crazy, but I simply do not understand the appeal... First, the service:  We arrived at 9p for our 9:30 reservation for a birthday party of 6. We were seated at 10pm. So, we waited outside for 60 minutes drinking overpriced beers (the bar area inside is much too small to accommodate non-diners). They had only one Coconut Porter left in stock. Really? Then, the food. They were out of several menu items, which surprised me. Overall, the food could best be described as Heavy, Greasy, and SALTY. Overwhelming, really. I shared the chicken liver toast, petit basque with chorizo, flat iron, and poutine. Also on the table to taste: the pork belly and quail.  Honestly, the only good dishes I had were the toast and the flat iron steak. Even the potatoes with the steak were incredibly oversalted.  For dessert, we shared a tres leche, which we all agreed seemed a bit stale. To quote the birthday boy, "I could get a full cake that tastes twice as good for this price at a Mexican bakery." Touché. In sum, leaving aside the somewhat bizarre concept behind this restaurant, they didn't execute that concept very well.

FINALLY. It happened. I thought about it for months, maybe years. I dreamt about it. I drove by it. Then, finally, FINALLY, with my former vegetarian self and two former vegan friends, we DID IT. We put millions of vegetarians to shame and indulged. MARROW BONE + CHIMICHURRI? Done. Did it. Wanna do it again. I wanna lick that marrow off the bone, forget the toast. BARBEQUE PORK BELLY SANDWICHES? Inhaled it. The boys even let me have the last little bite. 2 gentlemen and a fatass. FOIE GRAS, BISCUIT, MAPLE GRAVY. Shut up. Seriously, I shut up because I was inhaling that thing. Will absolutely never forget watching a certain uber granola/"vegetarian"/mountain climbing/truck living friend of mine asking for a spoon to spoon out every last bit of that gravy. Easily the most unique thing we had at animal/that I've ever had. BALSAMIC PORK RIBS. Absolutely too full by the time these reached the table, but they were placed next to me, and I was powerless against them. The smell of balsamic wafted up from these bad boys...well you know what happened next. HAMACHI TOSTADA: we decided to go with a light" plate - assuming that this little bite was going to be just alright was far, far from the truth. Amazing hamachi dish that I'd take over a sushi spot any day of the week. BACON CHOCOLATE CRUNCH BAR: for me...eh. maybe i was too full? maybe i just don't appreciate the bacon/chocolate combo. i wish we had gone for the sticky toffee pudding or tres leches - that bar just felt muddy and just plain yucky. but animal gets five stars nonetheless! loved it. thought about going back the next night, but my growing midsection convinced me to stay at home.

Oh Animal! Foie Gras will never be the same!  Absolutely nothing can compare to your Seared Foie with biscuit and maple sausage gravy!  I'm still salivating thinking about it!  Everything we ordered was excellent and each plate got better and better! We ordered the following: - Veal Sweetbreads - Rabbit Loin Spring Roll - excellent presentation and tasty! - Pig ears with chili, lime and fried egg - super duper tasy! - Flat Iron with sun choke hash and truffle parmesan cheese - order it rare! - Foie gras with biscuit and maple sausage gravy - major foodgasm!!! - Bacon chocolate crunch bar with salt & pepper ice cream!  Sweet and salty! Genius!   This place definitely gets packed, so if you don't have a reservation try to go right when they open so you can sit at the bar!  Their wine list is extensive and I love that you can order by the glass, carafe or bottle!  Their 2009 Nebbiolo d'Alba was fabulous!   I seriously loved this place!  Excellent service and food!  If you are a bit adventurous when it comes to food I highly recommend Animal!  You will not be disappointed! Cheers!

Top quality ingredients, blended and prepared masterfully, what's not to love? The Rabbit and Shrimp sausage spring roll is possibly one of the greatest things I have ever tasted. The Buffalo Pig Tails, glad I tried 'em. The Buffalo sauce was beyond words but the tails themselves were pretty fatty, like biting into semi-melted butter. I don't think they came from happy pigs, as those tails didn't wag very often. The Pork Belly sliders are a must-order item every time you go. Super delicious, perfect slaw, great bun, excellent sauce, crispy outside, tender and juicy inside. Nice space, but LOUD, and you are right on top of your fellow diners, which isn't totally awful because everybody seemed cool and you can get a glimpse of the menu possibilities and even ask your fellow diners how they are liking it if you are so inclined. Great date spot as you will quickly discern what type of person your date is. If she'll eat Veal Brains, there's not many things on this third rock from the sun that she won't put in her mouth... I'm just sayin' ;-)

I'm going to keep it short. 4 stars on Chicken liver toast, pig ears w/chili lime topped with sunny side up eggs, & marrow bone w/chimichiri. (amazing actually) Flat iron steak, sunchoke hash, truffle parmesan fondue was good and bad, I would totally give this dish 5 stars but the chewy steak stopped me. Perhaps an off night? 2 stars on the Poutine Oxtail. Dish was all too heavy for me. Parmesan just put it over the top. I woke up with THE worse stomach ache the next morning and felt nauseous. Really wanted to try their polenta 6 hour-belognese and fois gras loco moco, but we made the biggest mistake by not making a reservation and ended up waiting for 1 1/2.

I was super excited to try Animal after hearing such wonderful things about it.  Let me just say now that I was disappointed from the get go. The space is way too cramped and way too loud.  They need to take away some of the tables because you are literally back to back with the table next to you.  Once you sit down don't even think about moving.   We tried six dishes and they were all forgettable.  The only dish that I enjoyed was the pork belly sliders.  The other dishes we tried were: Potato Angolotti - basically a potato ravioli.  Probably the second best dish of the night Quail - sat on a bed of fruits and had an asian taste to it.  Can definitely be skipped Oxtail Poutine - this was alright, but is way too salty.  After a few bites I was over it Marrow Bone: tastes the same as any other place Foie Gras Loco Moco - super overpriced dish that is basically just fried rice Don't even think about getting dessert because their desserts are just sad and way too expensive for what you get. Service is terrible.  Remember the cramped space I was talking about?  Yes, I lost count of how many times the hostess hit my chair while walking by.  No apology or anything of that sort.  No, I will not be coming back.

Thank god for Yelp, for helping me find this amazing restaurant. Do yourself a favor and make a reservation ahead of time. Since October when I went, I now saw the episode of Top Chef where the owner of Animal was a judge on the "game" challenge. LOVE! I was in town for a wedding and needed a nice place for a 10 year anniversary dinner with friends. 6:15pm and 9:45pm was all they had, and I took the 9:45pm. I was so happy that we actually pulled through that night, driving from LAX, to Pasadena, and back to LA area for Animal. We were TIRED, HUNGRY, and EXHAUSTED. Not a good combo when you have a late reservation. We finally made it to a semi-sketch neighborhood and LA, parked (after driving in circles), and located the front of the restaurant. Charming! Just like NYC. We were seated right away. We ordered a bottle. Right away. Everything was so diverse on the menu, we had to try a bit of everything. Love that they recommend family style for that reason, and love that my friends don't have cooties and share germs. Here's what we ordered: Poutine oxtail gravy - SH*T. I've had poutine in french speaking Montreal and it tasted nothing like this. Give me a fork so I can shove as many fries in my mouth as possible. Yes, please. Oxtail gravy? Hell yes. The cadillac of fries. Crispy pig's head - I'm eating a pig's head and I don't care. Deep fried pork? Yes. Fois gras maple sausage gravy - Wowza. It's like Denny's and your local French spot had a baby. A really good baby. Most innovative dish I've seen in a long time! Totally unexpected. Polenta bolognese - Meat with polenta. So hearty and flavorful.   Yellowtail collar - Yes, it was good! But as you can see, I was busy pigging out on the other dishes. Hamachi tostada - Yes, it was good! But as you can see, I was busy pigging out on the other dishes. Bone marrow with chimichurri and caramelized onions - Can't go wrong with bone marrow. This is a meal that I'll always remember. We were all so excited and engaged with live mobile photo upload updates during dinner at the time. I can't wait to go back! OH, YES!

Easily one of the best meals I've had in Los Angeles, and now one of my fave restaurants! Ordered: Grilled baby broccoli with poached egg Hamachi tostada Foie gras loco moco Balsamic pork ribs Flat iron with truffle parmesan Pork belly sliders Poutine oxtail gravy Everything was exceptional, and the flavors just kept unfolding whether it was as simple as the Grilled Baby Broccoli or the masterfully assembled Foie Gras Loco Moco. The pork ribs just fell off the bone, and the pork belly sliders were definitely the best I've ever had with the perfect balance of tenderness and crispiness. Every dish bursted with flavor, but never teetered on salty. Great wine choices, and the service was impeccable. I heart you Animal!

It is with a sad heart that I give Animal 4 stars instead of 5. I really, really, wanted this to be a spectacular review, granted, 4 stars is still great. My fiance and I went here for our 3rd anniversary, and we ordered the chicken liver toast, pork belly sliders, grilled quail, yellowtail collar, & foie gras, biscuit with maple sausage gravy. YES, it is as good as it sounds!!! The food was phenomenal! The pairings of flavors was AMAAAAZZING --- totally reminiscent of Ratatouille, when Remy added lightning-y to his repertoire of flavors, it was a BURST of deliciousness. You MUST get the foie gras before the year is up -- 2012, foie gras will be banned in California! So get it while it's good; it tastes like BUTTTAHHH my friends. The yellow tail collarbone, was without a doubt, my fav entree of the entire night. Absolutely spectacular, fattiest part of the fish, ugh, can i have seconds, thirds, fifths, tenths pleasssseeee! Chicken liver toast for $3!!!! Do NOT share, get your own. such a great way to start off our dinner. the sweetness of the blackberries with the chicken liver, and the crunch of the bread, goodness, this is how all meals should start. What I was disappointed in was the pork belly sliders -- granted they came last after the stars of the entire night, but I was expecting a little bit more  -- can't win them all. THAT BEING SAID, the SERVICE BLOWS. I mean majorly blows, like seriously, could it get any worse? I wish I could upload the picture that our server took of us. it was off - centered blurry and was just of our heads.. WTF??????? He could give a shit about our keepsake memories. I almost want to give this place 3 stars because of how terrible the service is. With how much our dinner cost, we had to shell out $15+ for this dude, who could give a crap about us! Too bad I have a heart for those working in the restaurant business, I could never leave a bad tip -- but seriously UGH.

With 1200 something reviews, what's one more. I can understand the uniqueness of Animal compared to other restaurants, and the creativity they put into when preparing the dishes whether it be with oxtail, bone marrow, veal brains, veal tongue, or pig tails. But like any adventurous eater, taste is supreme, and the only dish that clearly stood out was the hamachi tostada, which is an appetizer. The pork belly sandwiches are good, but they skimp on the pork belly.  Poutine oxtail was also noteworthy, but a little too thick and heavy for me. We also ordered the rabbit legs and hedgehog. Funny part is we thought we were actually getting a real hedgehog animal, and asked wheres the hedgehog?  They looked at us disparagingly and said it was a mushroom. This place is called animal! Try a little harder, Animal.

My first real L.A. dining experience. I've eaten all over L.A., but never in a place with such star power. For my first time, I'm so glad it was Animal. THE RESTAURANT It's small, and unmarked. When walking down the street, pay attention to the numbers of the stores/other restaurants or you might miss it. MAKE A RESERVATION! I can't stress this enough. My boyfriend and I forgot to make a reservation, but we were LUCKY (lucky, I tell you!) to get bar seating after only a 20-minute wait. The waiters and hostess are very nice. Our waiter, Jeff, recommended a nice beer for my bf, the Ginga Kogen. I've always had a thing for guys named Jeff, and so I think it was meant to be. Our foods were brought out in a pretty timely manner; there was a little bit of wait between the fourth and fifth course, but it wasn't that big of a deal. THE FOOD 1. Rabbit Loin Spring Rolls, $14 -- tastes just like chicken but much more tender. The spring roll skin was delicious, and I really enjoyed the green curry. All of the ingredients worked well together. I don't know if I would order this again, though. 2. Coconut Sweetbreads, $15 -- Reminded us of popcorn shrimp. Seriously, substitute the sweetbreads for shrimp, and one would hardly know the difference. I thought the main item was largely flavorless, but I liked the mangoes and tamarind. 3. Marrow Bone Chimichurri, $10 -- I'm not big on marrow; this was really my boyfriend's dish. I personally liked how they made the garlic bread, and the marrow was all right. I can't remember much of it. 4. Foie Gras with Biscuit and Maple Sausage Gravy, $24 -- OMG. This was the one thing I really wanted all night. The flavors are rich, but they didn't feel heavy. I thought having the foie gras with a thick biscuit and maple gravy would taste way too fatty, but the opposite was true. I wanted more! It's a shame foie gras will be banned next year. 5. Poutine with Oxtail Gravy, $18 -- This was the dish that really made us full. They didn't skimp on the oxtail, and they certainly didn't skimp on the pungent cheddar. The fries were crispy and delicious; they made for a nice base for the gravy. 6. Balsamic Pork Ribs with Delicata Squash and Arugula, $19 -- Since I'm not a big fan of ribs in general, I didn't care much for this dish. I did like how the meat literally fell off the bone, and it was cooked until it was totally tender. The dish's highlight for me was the caramelized squash. They should build a dish with that in mind. 7. Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar, $7 -- Disappointing. The bacon, I think, is really there just for shock factor. I could barely taste it, and the bar was a lot smaller than in the pictures here! Imagine a really rich and thick chocolate bar with nuts inside, and you'd have a pretty accurate picture of this crunch bar. THE FINAL GRADE For creativity and atmosphere, I give this place an A. For actual taste, B+. Some things wowed me, like the foie gras and poutine, but some things were just a one-time order. (Skip thing like ribs and pork belly sliders; you can get those anywhere. If you come here, come with adventurous mind and taste buds. Otherwise, you're wasting your time.) The menu changes daily, so what you see in the pictures might not be available when you get there. Check the website for a clearer idea of what the menu will look like each month. Remember, MAKE RESERVATIONS. And order the foie gras with biscuit and gravy. You'll be glad you did!

So good that even my girlfriend who's first real steak was when I grilled it for her (4 years ago) loved it.  That's saying a lot, considered she is very squimish about any rare piece of meat or fat on anything...haha. The Ox Tail Poutine was soooooooooooo good!!!!  I want it every time I am hungry!!!

AMAZING MEAL FROM START TO FINISH. Fine details: atmosphere was chill, casual and relaxed. Service was friendly and attentive. Food was amazing. Decided to go all out for my best friends birthday and take her here. Started off with some wine and beer and chose about 6 plates + dessert for the night. Can I just say again... best meal ever!? We had one dish that listed croutons as a garnish, but little did I know these croutons would blow my mind. HOLY effing shit these croutons were the best croutons I've ever had... crispy but chewy... ugh. Also had a seabass dish that was mind-blowing. Ribs that fell off the bone as soon as the tine of my fork slightly touched it. I ate here a while ago, so I can't remember many details but the only lingering thought I have in my head it... HOLY effing shit. Best meal ever. From start to finish.

Not too long ago, Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo first met while attending culinary school at The Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  We've  walked pass this place dozens of  times while waiting to board our cruise. In June 2008 they opened their Animal Restaurant in Los Angeles to widespread culinary acclaim. During the same evening after dining at Jon and Vinny other restaurant Son of A Gun we headed over to Animal.  It was packed wall to wall with tables and diners. Unlike our experience at SoAG where we were able to taste and savor each dish, we were initially rushed by 3 of the 12 tapas being dumped on to our much too small table for 4 all at once. After bringing this dining flaw to the attention of our server, the pace was slowed down and we had a chance to settle in and better enjoy the food. Our table was kept very tidy and arrangements to have our dinner were changed periodically which was a nice compromise given the noisy and tense environment. Definitely more food was consumed at Animal than at SOAG. My preference between the two is the food at SoAG that is not as heavy and the overall dining experience was much more relaxing. I wouldn't recommend dining with more than two people. It was very uncomfortable not to be able to sit squarely in front of your meal. Plus their tables are better suited for two diners. I even have to wonder if the number of diners jammed into this place exceeds the fire code. I say that because the servers can barely squeeze through the  aisles. I will be the first to admit that our dining goals were much too lofty for this evening and we just consumed way too much super rich food between  here & SoAG. The next time... I'll wear ear plugs and come much hungrier with just my wife. FYI... this place is like a US Mint and there's no excuse for their gasoline station like unisex restroom.

One of the best places in LA. I've eaten here many times and all their savory dishes are great. My favorite are the rabbit legs!!!  Even the house wine is tasty.. Things to know: Their desserts are not great, walk down to Canters if your craving something sweet. Also, it you want a table on a Saturday night, make your reservation at least a week early.

When I think of the LA restaurant scene, I think of small restaurants that serve your favorite foods but with a gourmet twist. Animal is JUST that! First things first: make a reservation. We ate around 6:15 pm -- a time that's more considered part of the senior citizen dining scene but at Animal, it's a pretty darn good time to go. Not too many people there yet! Now on to the food. After salivating over everything on the menu, we narrowed it down to three: 1. Marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions - came with two pieces of perfectly toasted toast.. pretty much the best 4-5 bites ever! 2. Barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw - good, but really, nothing special 3. Foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger - came on a bed of rice and some sort of ridiculously awesome red sauce... in a words: ah-maze-balls! Everything complemented each other perfectly and while I'm quite convinced this may be a heart attack on a plate, but lessbehonest, some food is just worth it.. and this is one of them! And of course, we had dessert. We got the sticky toffee pudding upon recommendation of our server. This was served on top some mascarpone with a little bit of orange zest and sea salt -- these added so many different and delicious dimensions to the dessert that words kind of escape me. Words cannot do this dessert justice so go there and get yours!! Food is served tapas style so Animal is definitely a great place to go with a big-ish group so you guys can try out more of the menu. You better believe I'm already rounding up another group to go soon!

OMG, top 3 fav spots in Los Angeles. The "foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy" is what I would want to eat if i was stuck on an island and could only have one thing for the rest of my life. Assuming if I also had a very accelerated metabolism. WOW.... so good. Dont be scared to try the crispy pigs head or the marrow bone. And definitely dont forget to make a reservation ahead of time.

Soooo indulging!!   Yay: -Foie Gras Loco Moco: I think this was the best dish I had there! -Flat Iron Steak with Fondue: Yum! -Bone Marrow with Chimichurri: The chimichurri sauce was what made this dish so good. -Poutine with Oxtail Gravy: Really nice flavor.  The oxtail was cooked very nicely as well. Nay: -Pork Belly Sliders: The pork belly was cooked extremely well.  The reason why I didn't like it as much was because it had a bbq sauce on it and I'm not a fan of bbq sauce. -Chocolate Cake with Bacon and Salt and Pepper Ice Cream: I liked the ice cream but the cake wasn't that great to me. Great place to go with a group so that you can try everything.  I kind of felt sick a little afterwards just because everything seemed to have the same texture (super tender/fatty from the pork belly and the bone marrow). I only went with one other person and was super stuffed afterwards.

For those who don't care about ambiance, service, hot spots or scenic views... For those who only care about food... Animal is really as good as it gets. Everything on the menu sounds exciting and tastes even more so.  Bone marrow? Pig tails? Sweetbreads? Yes, yes, yes! Animal does small plates and the food is meant to be shared. For two people, the server recommended 4-6 plates. DH and I have bigger appetites than most in this town, so we had six plates and were utterly satisfied. My cholesterol and blood pressure must have spiked after this meal--good thing it was totally worth it. And I'm 25. My favorite dish was the foie gras loco moco. It was the best I've ever had (and I'm from Hawaii, so I would know eggs, hamburger, rice and gravy)! I couldn't believe foie gras and spam could co-exist on the same plate, let alone play on the same team. The dish was so comforting, creative and an edible heaven to die for. I also loved the barbeque pork belly sandwiches and pig ear. The pork belly was so minimalist yet perfectly fatty, flavorful and tender. I could eat this any day, any time of the day. The pig ear had was a surprise in my mouth--the crunch from the ears, kick from the chili, zest from the lime and comfort of the fried egg. It was different yet familiar and so refreshing. Everything else was excellent at best, very good at worst. As a NorCal girl, I barely visit LA but Animal is one reason to... and I only need one reason to do anything. If you have time for only one dinner in this city, Animal is it. And it is beastly (in an incredible way).

Chicken liver toast:  Oh. My. Gawd.  Creamy, savory, slightly sweet... nice crunch to the bread. Pork belly sliders:  Yes please!!  Fatty, succulent, flavorful pieces of pork with finger linkin' good bbq sauce.  I can eat 10 of those in one sitting, but I don't want a heart attack, so I won't. Hamachi tostada:  Light and refreshing! An explosion of flavors in your mouth.   Bone marrow with chimichurri:  You delightful piece of fat, I will suck you right off your bone!  But I won't, because I am proper and ladylike. Foie gras loco moco:  Comforting for the soul, expansive to my belly. Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy:  Sweet, savory, rich, and food-coma inducing.   Sticky toffee pudding: Good, but meh...  I'll pass next time. Service:  Attentive and friendly! Reservations:  Recommended.  And be there on time! Will I be back?  Heck yes!!

Animal is a great place to come to if you just want to try a bunch of unique dishes, each with its own distinguished flavors.  My friend and I stopped by for a quick bite while in LA and ordered what most people would recommend as must tries if you come to this place: The order the dishes came out in was a bit peculiar, but the timeliness of each dish coming out was paced perfectly. For the most part, the dishes were good but there were a couple of dishes that were misses for me. Crispy pig's head, pickled vegetable aioli- Amazing flavors from the veggies that complemented the perfectly fried pig's head. My friend's favorite dish of the night. Chicken liver toast- I'm actually not a big fan of liver because of its sandy texture, but this appetizer was made to be a spread and went down quite smoothly. Veal brains, vadouvan, apple sauce, carrot- Considering how fatty brains are, the veal brain was kind of bland and overwhelmed by the veggies it came with. Probably my least favorite dish of the night. Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy- Animal's signature dish and I can see why. Once again, I'm not a big fan of foie gras, but the maple sausage gravy that came with it made the foie gras amazing. Never knew gravy could be so succulent. Balsamic pork ribs, tomato & cucumber panzanella- paired perfectly with a glass of pinot noir. My favorite dish of the night.  Generally I can only find ribs flavored with barbecue sauce at tailgates. It was nice to find a different seasoning for once. My friend thought the ribs were too burnt, but I thought the smokiness went great with the balsamic vinaigrette. Marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions- It was good, but I was getting full from the ribs so I didn't really appreciate the dish as much as I could have. This dish should have came out earlier along with the chicken liver toast while the crispy pig's head should have come out in the end with the balsamic ribs.

I am just speechless... this is probably one of the best meals I've ever had! If brains, sweetbreads, and pig's ears freak you out... save yourself some time and go to the Cheesecake Factory... or even better stay home and watch Rachael Ray prepare a 30 minute meal. However if you are in for some bone marrow and foie gras, followed by pork belly sliders then this place is definitely for you! Make sure you make reservations ahead of time and go with a group of 3-5 people so that you can share as many different things as possible! PS: Please do yourself a favor and be adventurous... sure the ribs are great but they are ribs... try something new! Preferably something that would gross out your ex!

We had James as our waiter. He suggested us get the poutine, biscuit foie gras, while we added chicken liver toast, bone marrow, and lavendercrumble to the list. First, the service was okay. We showed up half and hour early and they managed to seat us, it was a slow Thursday night after all. The bus boy was sweet and attentive. Our waiter dint bother for introduction and was far less attentive. He also continued to check our id's for a long time... Sorry asians look younger than we appear? Food in order of favorite to least Chicken liver toast - a must have! Also for three dollars a pop. There was a lot of liver slather on the toast and probably the least saltiest dish of the night Bsicuit foie gras - delicious and creamy. Small portion but enough. I was done and tired of the flavor by the end so it was a good thing the dish was small. Bone marrow Salty goodness. Bf had better bone marrow but this was also decent Lavendar crumble For me this was one of thebest crumbles I've ever had. The lavender was delicious and really xame out in the dish. However I wish the dessert was in a cup not a dish for better scooping Poutine oxtail- No. tasted like pot roast on fries, the end. Overall may return o try other dishes but was not as good as we anticipated!

Let me just state for the record that the name makes it very clear this restaurant is not for the vegan crowd. Everything about Animal celebrates the mighty animal in all its tastiest (and sometimes surprising) forms. And as devout foodies, the preparations are among the most inspired and delightful we have tasted of late. If you have enjoyed the fried pig tales at Momofuku Noodle Bar in NYC (and God knows  you SHOULD), Animal will not disappoint. Pig parts feature prominently in these dishes, even in the bacon accented dessert. And each mouthful sings praises to the porcine pleasure before you. Between the four of us, we shared: - marrow bone and chimichurri sauce, - pig tails -  barbeque pork belly (phenomenal) - hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut; - foie gras -  bacon chocolate crunch bar ...and more... My advice? Go with friends. Share some dishes. Don't pass up dessert and enjoy one of the best dining experiences in LA these days. Modestly decorated, packed and very loud, the excitement about this restaurant is well deserved. Book well in advance and don't be in any hurry to savor every single course presented...just go hog wild.

Mash together 1 part Fine dinning restaurant, with 2 parts Waffle House and a BBQ roadhouse...  and you end up with 3 parts of Yummy that is Animal!!! First and foremost, I estimate I've been to Animal at least 30 times.  It's my favorite restaurant! What brings a simple bus driver from the valley back time and time again? The food? The vibe? The staff? Well all of the above. It is the most unique place in Los Angeles.  And because it's unique, Animal is a little different than the rest. If your going for your first time, don't freak, there is a high chance someone at the table next to you will peer over at your dish and ask "What is that?" don't be offended, look at it as a conversation starter, more than likely you'll peer at the next table over and do the same yourself.  Also don't be mad in the order your food makes it's way out of the kitchen...  It's a small kitchen and it will get there sooner or later. Rest assured I've never been left starving at Animal. Food-wise Jon and Vinny have this style that plays to all the flavor and texture points. My advice; order one thing you never would dream of eating.  That's how I discovered the Fried Pig Ears, Corey the waiter told me they simmer the ears for 30 hours to get them tender then they fry them crisp, mixed with a lime vinaigrette and a runny egg its a sloppy ode to crunchy heaven. A little tip; don't overlook the cheapest thing on the menu, the Chicken Liver Toast..  it's not your dads liverwurst and its a creamy yummy way to start the meal. I'm not going to run down the menu, this place is afterall the best reviewed restaurant in town..  but I want to mention the Poutine. Animal does their's  with the deepest, richest, stickiest, succulent, roasted oxtail imaginable, matched with a very smooth white cheeder cheese.  I've been known to drive 20 miles on a dark rainy night, just to beg for  seat at the bar to have some of that dark roasted goodness. Most importantly let me  talk service, because it's often overlooked. It is however, the cornerstone of Animal's success.  The space is small and busy, without a great staff it wouldn't be what is is today..  It may be the two famous dudes place, but in the 20 times I've been there I've only seen them 3 or 4 times( one or both are usually busy in the kitchen). But  people Like Victor the head server is working his butt off every night.   Ashely the manager is always nice and attentive. Corey, Sal, William and et al are great waiters and the whole staff rocks.  The reason I love all the service is that it's professional and attentive without being pretentious.  Make no bones about it... The Food is the star of this show!! As once was said about "The Clash" is so true here. Animal is the only Restaurant that matters!!!!!

I chose Animal for a special birthday celebration because many of my foodie yelper friends (whose opinion I hold in high regard) spoke so highly of the joint.  Plus, I love the name.   Thanks guys.  Wink. I loved it!!!  The service, food, wine and dessert were superb.  Truly.   James was our server.  He advised us on the menu and coursed the meal beautifully.  The plates are small and best shared- think tapas.  Eat here with friends so you can try as many dishes as possible. A reservation is practically required & valet is $5.50.  This is the order in which we feasted... Chicken liver toast: I couldn't resist ordering this little $3 appetizer.  I knew it would pair beautifully with my chardonnay and it did.  Lovely texture and flavor.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Hamachi- a delicious super fresh plate of yellow tail sashimi, avocado, cabbage, peanuts and jalepenos on a tostada.  The dressing was bright and clean. The tostada was crispy and salty.  It's presented like a gift topped with crunchy onions and a little edible flower.  It was my favorite dish of the night besides the dessert.  Seriously, I could have ordered two of these for dinner, eaten nothing else, and been a happy girl.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… BBQ Pork Belly Sandwiches:  yummy gourmet little sliders.   Poutine: This was very much what I would call a guy dish.  Imagine a pot roast exploded on a bed of fries.  Add cheese and gravy and there you have it.  It was good.  A little too salty.  Would have been better at 2:00 am after a long night of partying or if I was high.** Just saying.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Foie Gras Loco Moco- um- definitely a guy dish.  I tried it.  It was quite tasty.  I'm not really an eater of spam or ground beef.  Giggle.  He loved it though.  I will say the little fried egg on top was adorable. :) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Tres leches cake.  OMG!! Yes!! Ok.  Just- Yes!!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… So to review- I loved the entire dinning experience at Animal.  The simple plain décor of the restaurant clearly makes the food its star, and it certainly is.  Our server James was awesome.  The meal was timed and coursed perfectly.  The crowd was trendy LA foodie types- my people.  My favorites were the sashimi tostada and the tres leches dessert- Latin/Asian fusion does it for me every time.  At least I'm consistent.   Food: A Ambiance: A Presentation A+ Service: A+ Price: $$$$ Expect to spend.  But so worth it!!  Bring your own wine for $20 corkage fee.  This is a real price saver considering the wine starts at about $17 a glass.   So in closing my dear carnivores, your next meal in Mid-City must be at Animal.  Trust.   **Please let the record show that I am not implying or admitting to partaking in any activity that is illegal or can be construed as such.   How dare you.

Went here for the first time with a friend who lives in the area, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The place was crowded, so we waited for a half hour for the bar on a Tuesday night, which wasn't so bad, they do take reservations so if I'm ever out here again, I will be sure to book a spot before hand. We ordered the pig ears first, which were spicy and tasty, but I wasn't that big of a fan.  Fortunately, each dish coming out was better than the last.  The pork belly sandwiches were the best pulled pork sandwiches I've ever had, the consistency of pork and cole slaw was perfect, and the meat was JUST the right amount of fatty and textured at the same time. Next we had the oxtail poutine, which was definitely a tasty blend of fries, cheese, and...oxtail.  We finally topped it off with the foie gras, biscuit and maple syrup gravy.  this thing literally is meat that just melts deliciously in your mouth.  it's uncanny, and i'm wondering if Animal will import foie gras when California passes the ban on it, because this is the knockout punch on the menu. It was also nice to have a Coke from Mexico, they make it with real sugar cane instead of corn syrup, so it has a distinct pop to the taste. I will definitely be back when I visit LA.

I heard about this place years ago from a friend who had heard about the signature bacon chocolate crunch bar on the Food Network, but never thought to check it out until recently. We ordered 4 items and a dessert. First dish was hamachi tostada. It was nicely presented on the dish and tasted just as good. The tostada stayed crunchy instead of getting soggy. The only thing that wasn't good about this dish was the distribution of the vinaigrette. Some portions of the tostada were lightly seasoned with vinaigrette, while others were overly heavy, making the taste a bit too sour on the palate. Next up were the veal brains. It may sound odd, but it was super delicious. This was one of our favorites of the evening. Each bite literally melted in our mouths; it was so creamy, almost like butter. My husband commented that he understood why zombies liked brains. Try it and you will understand too! The third dish for the evening was the balsamic ribs. The meat just fell off the bone and was so tender. However, as with the tostada the balsamic vinaigrette seemed a little overpowering at times, but overall, still good. Last up was foie gras loco moco. We enjoy all things foie gras so this was a must for us. This was heavenly. For dessert, we were deciding between the bacon chocolate crunch bar and highly recommended (by Yelpers) dulce de leche. We went with the bacon chocolate crunch bar. Sadly, it was disappointing. It was small, as another reviewer noted, and nothing that seemed that special. It was a chocolate bar with bacon. The chocolate taste comes out first when you eat it and then the bacon kicks in at the end to let you know it is there.  I have a Mo's bacon chocolate bar waiting for me to try and I'm going to guess that it will taste similar.  I would recommend passing on this one and trying something else. We were able to get a 6:15 p.m. reservation; they open at 6 p.m. so it was not crowded inside yet. When we finished eating, it was packed and that was about 8 p.m. Definitely get a reservation if you plan to come. They do offer valet parking out front for $5 and street parking is free after  8 p.m. (metered).  Service was good - our dishes were cleared after each course and our water constantly refilled. The ambiance is a bit on the darker side, so for those that have trouble with reading in dark places, be forewarned.

Holy crap.   That is the thought that runs through my mind when I revisit the food from Animal.  While the prices of each plate can stack up incredibly fast and hit your wallet hard considering the proportions, the preparation, flavor and presentation of everything was pretty damn spot on. Pig ear - A really good combination of citrus and heat delivered by crispy pig ear strips.  I'm used to eating the Chinese stewed version of pig ear which leaves the crunch of the cartilage in tact, so this version was a pleasant change.  The cartilage practically melts into the slight crunch of the rest of the ear.  Oh there was an egg in the mix too, giving it a creaminess that awesome, because that is what eggs do.  That and hatch into baby things. Barbeque pork belly sandwiches - Hella good.  Tender meat, fresh slaw and fat all melted into a pillow like bun.  But then again, if you manage to fuck up pork belly then seriously...cmon.  It's pork belly.  Serving bad pork belly is like messing up beer from a bottle.  It's ALREADY GOOD AS IS. Foie Gras Loco Moco - WTF.  This shit is the reason why I want to go to animal rights protesters slap them with a hunk of beef that was raised in horrible conditions while still unbearably innocent.  Seriously.  Foie gras, spam, a medium rare hamburger patty, rice, and a quail egg (see how egg just gets shit done???) combine to form a party orgy in your mouth where your tongue is the star.  Of a gangbang.  A delicious gangbang.  Damn you LA for banning foie gras.  This is why PETA can suck it.  Seriously.  Suck.  It.

If the name doesn't tell you that you are in for a meaty experience, I'm not sure what will. I've been to Animal many, many times. It's one of those indulgent places where I feel guilty after having a big meal. We went in a group of 6 last night and I was happy to see that they've added many new things to the menu. My favorite new item was the soft egg with "texas caviar" or black eyed peas and bacon. Another new favorite was the quail! It was excellent, tender, juicy and flavorful. We also ordered a few of the things that have been on the menu forever: petite basque (ooey gooey cheese), pork ribs, hamachi tostada and the poutine. They were all great. I wouldn't recommend coming here with a group of six as it's really hard to share most of the items. We literally got a bite or two of most things. A group of four is a much better size. For the first time, I tried dessert last night at Animal. The bacon chocolate was ok, if not a little over rated. I did like the berries with lavender and crumble (a great recommendation from our waiter) as well as the sticky toffee pudding. It's a good meal but a heavy one!

Freaking. Wow. I've heard a number of things about this place: (1) that the decor is minimalist, and (2) that the food is supposed to be exquisite. Both things are true. Although some reviewers have said this minimalist decor leads to an uninteresting ambiance, I think it's GREAT. The interior feels very intimate but clean - a great environment for enjoying delicious food. As for the food, I was blown away. For some reason, despite what I'd heard, I wasn't expecting much.  My friend and I were hoping to get a 6:30 reservation but the first available was for 10:30 so we weren't even sure if we were going to make it out at all (call ahead... I made the mistake of calling on the same day - they take reservations starting at 2 pm). We ordered the following... Chicken Liver Toast (we were gonna share one, but gotta get your own): This thing is literally just chicken liver on a toasted baguette (with I believe caramelized onion and chives? on top) but it was addictingly good.  Seriously so simple but so good.  It's only $3. No reason to not get it. Foie Gras w/ gravy:  while eating this, I couldn't help but let out a few (or a lot of) "MMMMMMMMMMM"s,  "OHMYLAWD"s, and generally just keep asking my friend if he was enjoying this as much as I was.  It's a small dish but it's pretty HEAVY and rich so you don't need any more than what they give you.  As you're eating it, you experience so many flavors, it's like a party in your mouth.  There's a little bit of sweetness, savory saltiness, a little kick of peppery spiciness, its truly a delight for the palette. Although it was good, the next dish was my absolute fave. Hamachi Tostada:  After having such a decadent dish, eating the hamachi felt like biting into freshity crunchity heaven.  I am totally going to try to recreate this at home (and will probably fail) but its just hamachi over a tostada with cabbage, peanuts, thinly sliced jalapenos and some kind of delicious light Vietnamese (?) sauce.  I am doing such a poor job of describing how good this thing is but its GOOD.  My fave dish of the night. Pork Sliders: The sauce was good but after the hamachi, this was my least fave dish of the night. The meat felt a little overcooked.  It was good, no doubt but I wasn't as blown away as I was by the other items.   Overall, this was just a great eating experience and I know I'm going to be craving it pretty much erryday until i go back.

We'd been itching to go to Animal ever since we read about it in the New Yorker.  At last we decided to make our dreams come true for our 15th anniversary and made this a part of a weekend jaunt from San Francisco. This place did not disappoint!   Fried sweetbreads with Indian condiments arrived in minutes after ordering.  Crisp and delicious.  The presentation was divine, with tamarind sauce brushed in a broad stroke around the plate. Remaining dishes were served at a stately pace, but the wait was never unbearable.  The view into the kitchen revealed a steady, brisk rhythm. Our favorites: #1 Loco Moco #2 Liquid foie gras agnolotti with shaved truffles #3 Pork Belly Sliders Desert:  Tres Leches Don't hesitate to order everything you want.  The Loco Moco, although pricey at $35, is not that big in size if big in flavor.  I was kind of surprised when our bill came, because the total wasn't that high considering we had 8 dishes total, including desert. Also, be sure to come early and check out the nearby stores Supreme and Turntable Lab.  Great stuff!

This is the type of restaurant that you would want to take your friends to when they come into town. It is distinctly LA.  The place is too cool to have a sign and you need a reservation. Good service, my water was always full and the food did not take too long once we were seated. Try the bacon chocolate bar, pig ear and bone marrow.  Get about 2 dishes per person and share.

Man oh man, what an amazing meal.  This place is a carnivore's dream! We had quail, calf tongue, pigs ears, foie gras, and veal brains.  The menu was a little frightening at first, and the brains were added after the initial order, but we could not resist trying them because everything else was so splendid.   Highly recommend reservations.

If you are looking to take a few risks with your food intake -- try this spot.  As the name suggests you'll be eating a variety of animals, tapas style.  My favorites were the Hamachi Tostada (the perfect appetizer) and the Bone Marrow with chimichurri.   The wine list is expensive with no bottle under $30 and so is the corkage fee -- so good luck there. Go in knowing you'll be spending 60 per person for a memorable meal.  I'd like to go back and try a few more things but some other spots in LA will be visited first before I return.

First off, the food was amazing.  Everything.  I have to say though that the famed bacon-chocolate bar was over-rated. My only complaint(s) were in the service area.  My wife and I were meeting friends for dinner and we arrived early so we went to the bar.  We are in no way wine-experts, not even close, and I didn't know they only served beer and wine.  The bar chick was kinda bitchy when we were asking questions.  Never smiled, didn't really want to help and acted really impatient.  That is my main complaint. Other complaint is although we knew what would be served, we had no idea they wouldn't make any sort of concessions for my wife who is Kosher.  They wouldn't use a different dressing on a salad or not include cheese on a side with some of the meat courses.  We made do, but it was a slight annoyance, although I understand, sorta.  The waiter seemed annoyed to go over the menu with us to see what she could and couldn't eat.  We did initially tell him she was allergic to dairy as almost always that is easier to explain that how Kosher works.  Server wasn't too attentive.  Eat hear and then go eat at Craft to see the difference. Other than that, the food was amazing.  I forgot some of the details but in no particular order: Hamachi Tostada - we ordered 2 Chicken Liver - I am not a liver fan (working on it) but this was delicious.  Came simply on toast.  Id probably get this again as a starter. Pig Tails - fried and crispy served buffalo style.  Just like chicken wings but crispier and meatier.  TRY THIS. Veal Brains - yes, I ate this and it was good.  Creamy even.  I probably wouldnt order this again as I dont really like the concept of Veal. Grilled Baby Broccoli Salad - really good.  had some pork element in it, but I didnt tell the wife. I think it came with a poached egg?  Really good dish. Beet Salad - decent, but nothing special.  Could have made this at home. Pork Ribs - meaty and tangy.  I ordered this last (before desert) but I probably wouldnt get it again. Marrow Bone - first time eating this (a lot of firsts this night).  Came with a Chimichurri sauce on top.  Although the herbs were a little overpowering (but tasty), the richness of the marrow came through.  Also served with grilled toast which was delicious just on its own.  Another Veal dish that I probably wouldnt get again, regardless of how good it was. Foie Gras Terrine - our friend got this and I had a few tastes.  it was good, but so so so rich that I was glad I didn't get my own order, I wouldn't have been able to eat much.   The texture was amazing, flavor was decent. Stripped Bass - my wife really liked this.  I had a bite.  Pretty good although I am not a Stripped Bass kinda guy. Chocolate Crunch Bar - over-rated, sorta gimmicky.  The chocolate part was good, bacon wasnt too strong but not needed and added a saltiness to the bar that was a little too salty for my tastes.  I would have preferred just the plain chocolate. Sticky Toffee Pudding w/ mascarpone - amazing.  I would go back just to have this for dessert. I REALLY wanted to try the other pig stuff (head, 'listeners', belly sandwich) and the rabbit stuff... actually, I wanted to try one of everything but I just couldn't fit it in. Total bill before tip and including drinks came to $266 which really isnt bad, $66/per person.  Figure you go to any other restaurant where a main course could be $30, appetizer, 1-2 drinks & desert and you would pay just about the same  but with not-so-interesting or tasty food. 4 stars because of the attitudes.

Everyone that knows me knows I am a huge animal lover.  I have 3 cats that I treat like my own children.  So it may be a little macabre that one of my favorite pastimes is feasting on animal parts (hence my personal quote).  So it was inevitable that I found myself dining at Animal.   Animal gets high marks on the novelty and originality factor.  There aren't many restaurants in LA where you can choose from 3 different preparations of foie gras, rabbit legs, veal brains, or pig tail. The menu looked interesting and we settled on some of the more popular dishes:       * chicken liiver on toast (5/5):  This dish (only $3!!)  was surprisingly the star of the evening.  So simple in construction yet complex in texture and taste.  The balance between savory and sweet from caramelized onion hit a high note on my palette.   * hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanuts (3.5/5):  This dish was light and refreshing.  A nice contrast to the other dishes which were very heavy and flavorful.  Good but standard stuff. * Bone Marrow, chimichurri, caramelized onions  (4.5/5):  The bread that you smear the marrow on was thick, soft, and pillowy.  Chimichurri added a nice touch!  Fat + Bread = Win. * foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy (4.5/5):  This dish tasted like a McGriddle.. on crack!  I just wish the biscuit wasnt so drenched with the maple gravy, kinda ruined its delicate flaky crust.   * Bbq pork belly sandwiches, slaw (4/5):  Wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be, but still delicious!  Meat was so tender and flavorful.  Reminded me of a McRib.  I know its a travesty to make McD references at a place like this, but hey let's not be food snobs :) * Pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg (1.5/5):  a resounding least favorite of the night!  The lime was way too overpowering, its all I could taste!  Even the fried egg didn't salvage this one.  If you want tasty pig ears, go down to any Taiwanese eatery in San Gabriel.   We did not order wine or dessert, so including tax + tip + 1 root beer, the total came out to $101.  Not bad.  I am truly an animal lover!

I'm so happy that I finally got to try this place. Star sighting alert.. Aziz Ansari from Park & Rec was sitting at the table right next to me!!! I love him on that show! He's hilarious! Okay... back to the food. Delicious tapas! I'd recommend ordering at least 2 dishes per person because the portions are pretty small. My fave dishes are: 1) Foie gras w/biscuits & gravy 2) Veal tongue 3) Bone marrow 4) BBQ pork belly sliders 5) Pig ear Save room for the bacon chocolate crunch bar w/ice cream for dessert! The only thing that kinda sucks about this place is that it can't accommodate large parties.

I heard many good reviews about this restaurant but a few pplz warned me that it was a little over hyped...that being said, I brought down my expectations but Animal really lived up to its reputation and did not disappoint.   When I walked into the restaurant it was much smaller than i had expected. Normal decor...i was doubting if i had entered the wrong diner!!! I had just automatically assummed that this high end restaurant would look similar to a Boa or XIV.  I came for a Friend's bday but without reservations but it was a monday so we tested our luck. we got lucky and was seated immediately. The Bday girl and I love animal parts and so we were excited to order: pig ears, foie gras loco moco, bone marrow, hamachi tostada, flat iron. Everything was delicious!!!! pig ears started out w/ a sour flavor and ended w/ a nice kick of spice. flat iron was tender, hamachi (this was good but wasnt nearly as innovative as the other dishes so skip) really tasted more like a fish ceviche on a tostada shell. bone marrow was overwhelming in flavor and fatiness, mucho muy bien if u like bone marrow, its one of the better ones i've tasted.  loco moco is an interesting one, i liked the heavy foi gras in the dish but it also rubbed me another way as well. Sometimes foie gras taste like solidified lard/fat and when eating it w/ the hamburger meat it was a good compliment to each other. the food had plenty of flavor but my artery had to work overtime to unclog!!! totally worth it though.!!!!!!! I told our waiter that it was my friend's bday and they brought out a small plate w/ a candle...!!! no dessert included on the bdays??? its almost like a standard practice nowadays to have even a tiny scoop of ice cream. we were both full out of our minds but I didnt think they needed to skimp us out on that part.

I am as obsessed with Animal as I am with eating them. I have to admit, I was unashamed to lick my fingers because yes, it's that great. pork belly sandwiches- amazing. i cannot stop thinking about them. poutine oxtail gravy- so rich. so heavy. (a tad on the salty side) but hey, finished it with a huge smile on my face. froi gras with biscuit- oh get in my belly. A generous portion atop a bed of sweet, crunchy biscuit, cooked to perfection. balsamic pork ribs- heavenly. fall-off- the-bone-with-a-swish-of-your-fork delectable! Personally loved the balsamic rub and the bf who prefers bbq ribs even loved them. eating at Animal is mouth wateringly necessary. oh but there are some cons (unrelated to the actual meal): a rez is a MUST. the word's out that this place is orgasmic so just make a reservation. The place is pretty small and so easy to miss as they do not have a sign in front of the restaurant. Hostesses code for "about 20 min" is more like 1.5hrs without one. Salud to a memorable meal!

Hi my name is William S., and I haven't written a review since March.  Let me fix that. I went to Animal, and why I've never wrote a review about this place right after eating here kind of leaves me flummoxed.  Let me fix that, too. This is one of those places that took forever for me to get on the ball with. You know, a place where everyone of your meat-eating friends have gone before, and you have to damn near beg them to go back again, so that you have someone to go with when it's your first time? Those places? Well, the only difference between a typical place that requires the aforementioned begging and Animal is that this is not a place I had to beg anyone to go back to. This place takes the hype, bends it over its knee, and has it screaming before its first smack.. If that doesn't make sense, this should:   I invited a group of friends to come and join me just so I could name drop to other people that I, too, have been sophisticated enough to dine there.  "Oh yeah, I've been to Animal before. Oh, well, you know ... it's no big deal. Oh you've never been there before?  You should totally go!" I didn't have nearly a tough time having a group go with me as I thought. And so to Animal I went; and to Animal I dined.  And now I see myself as someone who's willing to go "along for the ride" the next time around if someone else were to ask if I wanted to go eat there. Because the portions tend to run small, and the prices aren't really congruent with that, the safe bet is to order a variety of dishes. That's exactly the approach my friends and I took. And while they offered a smattering of interesting options, the dishes I chose to add to our table's family-style dining were the rabbit loin spring roll and the Thai barbecue quail.  The rabbit loin spring roll is made, and garnished with, eggplant, sprouts, and a green curry drizzle. Unfortunately there's no super sizing the dish, but I would've gladly thrown in a couple dollars more and had a steroid-sized version if I could. The quail entree was small as well, and made with scallions, citrus, cashew and a yogurt sauce that the quail rested on.  Both dishes were worthy of the praise I had heard about regarding Animal. Some other culinary doodads I tried were the hamachi tostada, complete with herbs, a fish sauce vinaigrette, and crushed peanuts; the barbecue pork belly sandwich; and the melted petit basque with chorizo, on grilled bread.  All of them left an impression, with the exception of the pork belly sandwich -- typically something I could do without, anyway. Lastly, the place is rather -- how shall I say this? -- small. It doesn't really have the quaint factor of place that's homely and comfy. It's just small, maintains an heir of elegance, but also not very showy. While the place, itself, remains rather unspectacular, given many other dining options in L.A., this place is really just about the food.  And it does that really well.  The waiters also really know the dishes very well. Well, anyway, how does one round-out a review of this caliber?  I don't know! What if I just tell you that this receives a 4-star worthy of praise? Will that do the trick?  No?  Ok. (Just go.) - Will P.S. The Obligatory Information of Relevance Part of the Review:  Corkage fee is $20 a bottle, so I think that pretty much speaks for itself.

I hate restaurants that say "no substitutions." That's either chef arrogance or "no real chef" laziness, but either way it doesn't put the guest first. Since when was "dressing on the side" for your only real salad considered an earth-derailing modification? Best parts of the meal - interesting, obscure wines and delicious meaty stuff (marrow bone and pork belly sandwiches rocked my world). Our server was very, very average - zero personality bordering on douchebaggery, and we didn't see him for half an hour; were keen to order more wine until he was MIA. Great bartender though. That said, too much salt on everything! At least they kept pouring the water... Will not be back. Enough other great restaurants in LA that care about making guests happy.

Without a doubt my favorite restaurant in LA. The incredibly creative menu may be daunting for the more reserved palates, but wow, every dish I ordered was so incredibly rich and delicious. Must haves: chicken liver toast, foie gras loco moco, veal sweetbreads, pig ear, bacon chocolate crunch bar. Go for a few hours and really make a night of it. Try as many things as you can. Talk to the staff, they are foodies too. They'll help you pick the perfect bottle of wine and will walk you through every dish.

On my drive back from a most fabulous second visit to Animal with my gf C. I was trying my best to remember what I had on my first visit - having gone with a large group, most of the the dishes were a blur and I couldn't remember what I ate or how it tasted but I had a general fuzzy good feeling that I enjoyed most everything. Last night was no exception and after awakening from my food and beer coma this morning, I'm trying today to record last nights taste sensations. BRANDYWINE BEER - If you like a sweet beer, then this your choice.  Unfortunately you can't pretaste any of the beers as they're all in bottles and cans, but the bartenders made some nice recommendations for both the beers and wine.  My brandywine was served in a wine glass, which made it feel pretty classy. CHICKEN LIVER TOAST - Soft stable & somewhat dense thick slice of bread served as the bed for a smooth smear of chicken liver topped with a line of sweet onion jam and finely chopped chives.  My gf chopped in half and I'm glad I had someone to share it with.  The liver was smoothly pureed with a nice umami taste in the forefront that was punctuated by the sweet/savory of the onion jam, and ended with a light liver-y taste.  I'm not the biggest fan of chicken livers.  I've eaten it yakitori style while growing up in Japan and never really preferred it since it was so concentrated and grainy. But C. and I thought, "Hey it's $3 and we've never had it before, we're game."   If I had to eat chicken liver it again, I'd definently prefer Animal's instead of it in yakitori form. FOIS GRAS TERRINE - O. M. G.  Hands down best dish of the night for me.  C. is a big fan of fois gras and tries it whenever she encounters it in her dining adventures.  As there were three fois gras options, including the ever popular fois gras with a gravy covered biscuit, the clincher was we've never had it as a terrine before.  What a delicious combination of spreads for the toast - the terrine was soft and cholesterol-y with a layer of prosciutto in between, the date jam was sweet and unexpected, add the crunch of toasted bread with a smear of both made for the most decadent slice of toast.  We ordered another order of 4 pieces of toast as we were frugal with our smear on the first round. PORK RIB SLIDERS - Always a crowd pleaser, it's kinda difficult not to just pull out the tender rib meat and eat it alone, but the crunchy smothered slaw & sweet hawaiian bun are worth it to enhance the rib meat. SPICE RUBBED YELLOW TAIL COLLAR - This one was definently not my favorite.  If I see yellowtail collar on the menu I'll order it and last night was no exception.  It looked tasty, all dry rubbed with dark spices sitting in a light sauce.  Unfortunately the spices were so strong it overwhelmed the delicate fish flesh and wipe out my tongue.  My palate was so covered in spice it was hard to eat anything afterwards and be able to taste (I also got a little heartburn with each bite).  I saved eating this one for last and once I got into the interior meat and left the spice rubbed pieces alone, it got better.  But poor fish - it really doesn't deserve to be masked like that.  Better to just grill it simply with salt and such. BACON CRUNCH BAR with S&P ICE CREAM If you've managed to finish glutting your self on all you've ordered, and are desiring dessert, I totally recommend getting a cup of coffee for this.  C & I were stuffed and didn't end up finishing our dessert.  =*( What little I did experience was the surprisingly strong smoky & leathery tastes with a salty sweet finish of the bacon crunch bar and the interesting cool palate cleanser of salt & pepper ice cream with crumbled polvoron  (Filipino folks, you know what I'm talking bout) on the bottom. It was nice little bite of meat covered dessert and definently a good thematic finish to our meal at Animal. RESERVATIONS & PARKING Not a bad experience at all in both reservation and parking.   Around 2:45ish I left a voicemail with my reservation request time and the staff returned my call after 4:15.   They couldn't accomodate my after 6:30 PM request as they were all booked, but fit me into a 6:15 slot.   I bounced outta work at 5:15, but gave them a call mid-trip just to let them know I might be a little late.  The staff let me know that Animal has a 15 min grace period - which after all that rushing, I didn't really need and arrived there from DTLA a little before 6.  I parked and walked a couple of blocks over to grab a drink.  My gf however wasn't going to make it in time for the grace period so she went straight to valet about 6:25 so she could make it in time. Be warned, they won't seat your party unless everyone is there.  I would recommend that if you're expecting a large group, make sure everyone gets there a half hour in advance (even if you have to lie to them to get them there).  Street parking isn't the easiest, especially as the night goes on.

I had heard about this place for a long time and always wanted to try it. Luckily I went with someone who was very familiar with the menu. Many of the dishes were like nothing I had ever had before. The Quail was AMAZING. Also amazing was the ribs and fois gras. I had never had fois fras before, and I have to admit I am now a fan. Don't be afraid to try the cow tongue and pig ears either. Though they sound scary, they look normal on the plate and they taste fantastic. Also, do not leave without trying the bacon Heath bar...among the best desserts I have had.

This is my first yelp review.. so you know this restaurant has to be that good in order for me to write about it ;) A good friend of mine took me here for my birthday dinner and we ordered: (in order of favoritism but most of the ones in the middle are tied for 3rd) Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy- This could have been my last meal and I would have died so happy. We couldn't stop raving about this dish. The foie gras and gravy together just melt on your tongue. The biscuit was a nice addition to the dish as well. All the flavors combined made the plate really rich in flavors. Rabbit loin spring roll, eggplant, sprouts, green curry- we mainly ordered this dish because we wanted some sort of "veggie" substance to balance out the rest of our fatty dishes. The rabbit spring roll was nice and crunchy and was paired to a tee with the green curry puree. Chicken liver toast- mMm the spread was perfectly creamy on top of the toasted bread and the shallot dressing on top just made each bite more savory than the first. We could have eaten 10 of these that night. Pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg- I was skeptical of this one at first but the fried egg reeled me in. No, they don't shove a pig's ear in your face, but presentation wise, it looked like thinly sliced chips seasoned with chili and lime (sort of resembling those hispanic chicarones chips) with the fried egg on top. Who needs bacon when you can substitute pig's ear? It was THAT good... BBQ pork belly sandwiches, slaw- The dish came with 2 mini sliders. The pork belly was crispy on the outside, tender and succulent on the inside. I'm usually not a fan of slaw but the flavors mixed together in the sliders were delectable. Marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions- this just melts in your mouth. All the flavors combined on the garlic toast was muy deliciouso! Not only were we stuffed, but we had to try the dessert: Bacon chocolate crunch bar with s&p ice cream- Let's just say if I didn't have the last dish, I could have probably eaten the entire thing myself without feeling so guilty, however it's a great dish to share. The bacon chocolate bar is a little hard at first but the bacon comes as a kick after the sweetness of the chocolate. I think the ice cream had sort of a hazelnut flavor ( I can't remember exactly) but the ice cream and bacon bar were definitely the finishing touches of our evening. I will definitely try a new desert next time. Service was really on par as well. We were running about 20 minutes late, but the host was nice enough to push our reservation back. We got seated quite quickly and our charming waiter made sure we enjoyed our meals and also made a few suggestions to our indecisiveness on which meals to get (because everything sounded amazing) You can definitely find street parking or park at the lot down the street for $5. Also, don't forget to make reservations as this place gets very packed. Bon Appetite! :)

make a reservation, parking is difficult to say the least.  don't believe  the hype. they  have  an unusual menu but we couldn't help to think twice  about thier morals because they still serve foie gras which we thought to be pretty  lame.........hoping they take it off the menu then we will go back - until then its a  big NO.........

"Animal", a funny name for a restaurant but very fitting. Their menu will make any adventurous carnivore happy. However, if you are expecting some manly meaty love, you might be disappointed. Animal really reminds me of a restaurant called Ubuntu in Napa Valley. For those of you not familiar with the Bay Area dining scene, Ubuntu is a vegetarian (and vegan friendly) restaurant featuring farm fresh ingredients and highly innovative menu. How is that related to a meat centric restaurant, you might ask? I found these two to be almost the mirror image of each other. Their philosophy and creativity are the yin and yang. Let me quickly get to the point before you get tried of my rumbling. The food is excellent. Everything tasted and looked great. You have to come here with an open mind and be adventurous. Don't be scared away by items such as veal brains or pig head on the menu. I can reassure you, the presentation is amazing and most of the time the food looks nothing like its original form. All of the dishes I have tried were excellent. The most memorable ones were the veal brains and the quail. For those of you who never had brains before, it actually has a silky texture similar to tofu with almost no distinct flavors. The deep fried veal brains was such a delicacy. The sauce compliments it well. The quail has a great texture. Every bite was juicy and tender. Love that yogurt sauce too. If you want something refreshing to offset the stronger meat dishes, Heirloom Melon is an excellent choice. It works well as a palette cleanser too. Of course, you can't go wrong with their foie gras with biscuit. Oh...let's not forget about their Coconut Sweetbreads and Crispy Rabbit Legs. Did I mention I like most of their dishes I have tried? The Balsamic Pork Ribs is probably my least favorite one. The sauce was too sour and the ribs was not as tender as I would like. Dinner format is tapa like and sharing is highly encouraged. Bring a bunch of friends so you can try a variety of stuff. The dessert was not as amazing as their main dishes I am afraid. I found their Tres Leches cake to be quite weak. What happened to the rich milk flavors? Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar was decent but this combination should be no stranger to anyone who tried the famous Vosges bacon chocolate bars. Reservation is a must. There are only very limited seats available for walk ins. Make sure you reserve your table well in advance too.

Any restaurant that can make veal brains delicious let alone edible is worthy of 5 stars to me. BIG MISTAKE:  We did not make reservations on a busy Thursday night before Labor Day weekend so we ended up waiting TWO HOURS for 3 seats at the bar. I would recommend making reservations a couple days in advance, otherwise expect a very, very long wait. SERVICE:  The hostess was really nice and apologized for our long 2 hour wait, even though it wasn't really the restaurant's fault. We appreciated that. The servers were just right. Not too chatty, not too haughty. They were very down to earth and quick at their hands and feet. What I appreciated most is that all the employees at Animal pitched in with everything:  the servers were wiping down silverware as the hostess was wiping down tables as the manager was pouring water in empty glasses. You can tell that the people behind Animal have a great staff with people who work hard. AMBIANCE:  The restaurant was filled with semi-hipsters, first time dates, and mature palettes. It was our first time at Animal, and we never felt out of place or inferior. Great, down to earth ambiance. FOOD: The food was AMAZING. Here's what we ordered: Chicken Liver Toast:  I hate chicken liver, but this stuff blew me away. If you're not a "spreadable meat" type of person, order it anyway. It's only $3, and easily sharable with one or two more people. ORDER IT. Bone Marrow (marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions):  I've never had bone marrow before (there were a lot of firsts for me at this restaurant), and it was nothing like I expected. It comes in this big bone and the innards are moist, full of flavor and spreadable on the piece of buttery toast. ORDER IT. Burrata (burrata, raymundo's tomatillo salsa, olive oil):  I've also never had burrata before, and this was one of the best dishes of the night. SO refreshing, so light...perfect amidst all the heavy, rich dishes. MUST ORDER IT. Potato Agnolotti:  My friend put it so perfectly:  It's like mashed potatoes in ravioli! It comes with about 7 pieces, so an easy-to-share dish. Not too heavy, and not too creamy or oily (like most pastas are). Lightly peppered with cheese, so it's not overwhelming. ORDER IT. Barbeque pork belly sandwiches with slaw:  This comes as 2 sliders. The bbq pork belly was extremely soft. I'm not a huge fan of slaw, so I could've done without the slaw. However, my friends really enjoyed it and thought it was the best plate of the night, so ORDER IT. Veal brains (with vadouvan, apple sauce, carrot):  WOW. Amazing. We knew we wanted to try something adventurous and crazy, and the one dish that looked the most bizarre was the veal brains. It almost looks likes mini beef patties. The outer texture is very beef like, but then you bite into it and you get this warm, melt-in-your-mouth, yummy gooey-ness. YOU HAVE TO ORDER IT DON'T BE SCARED JUST ORDER IT!! Poutine with oxtail gravy and cheddar:  Probably my least favorite dish of the night:  Slightly too salty and the fries were not cooked very well. But the oxtail was spot on. MAYBE ORDER IT. By the end of the night, we were stuffed and had NO room for dessert. I think 7 dishes between 3 girls is just right (the chicken liver toast is just one piece of toast that can be split 3 ways, so it's really considered a mini dish, so 6 dishes can do the job for 3 girls as well). I will definitely be coming to Animal again. My high expectations were met.

THE INTRO: What a solid dinner. Like seriously. Solid. I guess the fact that my friend had her work comp part of the meal made it that much better, SHWING :D Anyway, so day of, my friend was like, "Hey, did you make reservations like I asked you to?" Me "Uhh, I called yesterday, but didn't talk with anyone, just left a message....hopefully they got it?" Yes, undependable me :( THE SERVICE: We get there and they didn't have the reservation, and they were COMPLETELY booked for the night. WOW. That popular guys. Luckily, the hostess hooked us up as she probably saw the dagger eyes I got from my buddies. As soon as some bar seats opened up, she flagged us over. Hospitality? 5 stars right there. THE DRINKS: So after being seated, we perused the menu. Some interesting items for sure. We had no idea where to start. The bartender/waiter was excellent. While mixing drinks, he gave us some great suggestions and even entertained our indecisive banter. We grabbed a bottle of Coteaux (great recommendation, crisp and light) and began chowing down on some amazingness. THE FOOD: Hamachi tostada, a nice way to start, some poignant flavors. The BBQ pork belly sandwiches definitely stood out, crispy and tender at the same time?! How'd they do that?! The flat-iron with truffle parmesan...wow, rich, juicy. We also ordered the foie gras, which my buddies devoured with contentment beaming from their faces...nope, I'm not a liver fan :P We ordered a couple other dishes, but can't remember now. THE PUNCHLINE: But all in all, great dining experience, from the people to the food to the chill/simple ambiance. Great place to bring a date. Just make a reservation :)

This is not me being hyper-negative, cynical, or angry about ex-girlfriends, past car accidents, health insurance rates, or traffic; This is a simple, truthful, and realistic review of dinner tonight at Animal. Way too salty, way too heavy, and WAY over-priced and over-hyped. We had the pork belly sandwiches, the hamachi toast, the short ribs, and a couple of other dishes that I can't remember (which in and of itself says something). Hard for me to believe that this place gets so many good reviews....or maybe not to hard to believe, based on a few other restaurants that many Angelenos rave about but are sub par. The only slightly redeeming dish was the hamachi toast, but more of the kind of dish you'd find at a slightly fancy Swingers or something. Thick, hyper sweet and hugely salty sauces; greasy, heavy combinations; amateur tastes for the amount of the money required at touchdown. How can a bill of $115 be the end result of this? I'm perplexed, flummoxed, and bemused -- and there are no better words coming up in the thesaurus right now. You may call it being negative; I call it being realistic (and I smile and laugh way too much). Animal -- at least in my experience tonight -- is not at the level. Off night in the kitchen? Perhaps. I'm just not terribly inclined to try it again...

I went to this restaurant for my friend's birthday. The restaurant is a little bit too loud, I  have  hard time to hear what my friends said. The service is pretty good, our server was very nice but sometimes is hard to locate him. Looks like they are under staff, our server is sweating a lot probably because of all the running back and forth, could hire couple more people. The food is ok, but a little bit pricy and the dishes are pretty small. For 5 people we ordered like 10 dishes + We like the Chicken liver Toast, pig tails, pork ribs, hamachi tostada and the burger. Not too crazy about the marrow bones, pig ear, pork belly and the desert. Overall is not bad but is not as good as I think will be, probably because I have too high expectation.

I've been wanting to try this place for a while.  Fresh off a 6 hr drive to LA, this was the first restaurant I went to. Food: 4/5-   Explosion of flavor.  We loved the chicken liver toast, the bbq pork belly sandwiches, the poutine/oxtail gravy, and foie gras loco moco.  The only downer of the night was the flat iron steak, which wasn't very good.  You should be warned that everything is very heavy, so we felt a bit queasy at the end of the night.  I think next time, I'll try to add in more veggie and seafood plates. Service: 3/5-  Decent service.  The star of the night was the gentleman who was bussing our table.  Our waiter was good also. Environment: 4/5- The environment and the menu compliment each other nicely.  It's a small intimate place that is simple and unpretentious. Value: 2/5-  Pricey for the amount of food you get. Return again?:  Yes.  I would like to return with more people so I can try more items.

A place for foodies, by foodies. I'm not a foodie but my fiancé is and she really wanted to try this place, so we went. Now the best thing about this place is the staff. They are foodies, they love food. It's not the usual stuck up waitstaff of wanna be actors who are pissed they have to serve you to pay the bills. It was a pleasant surprise. The atmosphere is nice. The restaurant is clean, simple, neat and relaxed. Like every other place in LA the prices are high. I personally think they are higher for what you are eating, you're telling me these guys can't get a price break on chicken liver? Any way, it's LA, you're not getting out cheap. The food, well for me it's just eh. My fiance loved it but by the third plate my body was done. It's like shoveling spoons full of fat into your body and mine had enough. Everything on the menu is rich and very fatty. Now don't get me wrong I like to have something fatty every now and then but after 3 plates it was just too much. The waiter said for two people he suggested 5 plates, but we had ordered 3 with the intention of trying desert. After the third plate, there was no way I could eat anything else here. Overall it is what it is, you're eating well prepared over priced misc parts that are very rich and heavy.

Came here on Saturday April 7th for my birthday surprised by my wonderful bf. Animal takes reservations at 2pm and does not open until 6pm. The closest availability was at 7:15 PM. Since we live in Orange County and were in the area, we arrived about 40 minutes early to wait for the other half of our party and to find the place easily and fast (reason: LA Parking is a hassle). Coming from the Grove and using the navigation, we headed North on Fairfax. Passing the place, Animal does not have a sign that says "Animal". It's almost a hole in the wall type sorta place where the address number is easily visible. We parked in the neighborhood, since it was Passover, Parking Security had the day off and tickets were not issued. BIG BIRTHDAY PLUS!!. Walking around the corner onto Fairfax, we see the lot for Canter's which is strictly for Canter's with validation.Pass a couple of stores and bam! ANIMAL! Animal sits right at a crossing light. We tried to enter the restaurant, but some guy was leaning on the door and my bf did not want to be mean and see the guy fall.Barely any tables were filled. Once he left, we check in. The hostess half highlights our names and offers us drinks/beverages to sip on while waiting for our party to arrive. My bf asked the hostess recommended dishes and what she prefers, she gave us her honest opinion. Ordered the Hanks Orange Cream Soda ($4) while waiting. I'm not a big fan of Orange Cream, but this had a subtle cream flavor to it with a balance of Orange soda..MmMMm Delicious. I know this is odd to say about ice cubes, but they were nicely cubed shaped and served in nice tall cylinder cups. Not often you see nicely cubed ice. From 6:40pm to 7:15pm, when we got seated, all the tables were filled. NOTE: It is best to order all at once and to share due to the rich flavors of every dish. It's not super filling, but enough to suit your appetite. Dishes are a lot smaller than they look in pictures. Also best to make reservations in my opinion. Ordered the Veal Brain $14, had a nice texture to it. Rich in flavor. Veal Tongue $14,      -My favorite appetizer dish to start with. The tongue comes in small sliced pieces, which reminded me of Chinese sausage. Then a nice big sharing piece of soft Foie Gras, which was all nicely presented. Quail Fry.     -meh..I found this to be a whatever dish. Came with 4 small pieces of Quail legs. Nothing too exciting to say about this. If you want Quail, go to any Asian place that serves it for a smaller price and the pieces would be bigger or just buy it and fry it in a small pot at home. Hamachi Tostada..Just your typical average cerviche tostada you can find else where. Foie Gras, Biscuit, and Maple Gravy, $24      -Very good, the biscuit is very very good, but the flavor overwhelms the foie gras. So if you're not a foie gras lover, this would be good to try out. The maple gravy was nicely sweet because of the maple. The combination over all, I would recommend. Foie Gras Loco Moco, $36     -BEST DISH ALL AROUND! It's like eating heaven in your mouth. Everything in this dish is perfect. Rice had a nice slight crisp to it, the infusion of salty, sweet, rich, etc. To die for! 2 Bacon Desserts, $7 each.      - I highly recommend as well. Very rich flavor dish, best to share! It's hard to describe this, but it's something you'll regret if you don't get it. Great experience!

Made a reservation for 3 people for 10:30pm this past Saturday (a few hours ago actually). We showed up a little over 17 mins late, and the hostess was fine with that. Then again, we did call to let her know we would be late, but I'm glad she was so nice about it. Walking in, you can hear in addition to people talking, some moderately loud music, which is fine. This isn't an upscale fine dining joint, despite the quality of the food. Our waiter had a great sense of humor and I couldn't need or ask for more, so the service was amazing. So here is what we ordered. -Chicken Liver Toast ($3): This was ridiculously delicious. I mean if you love chicken livers, the pate you get on vietnamese sandwiches, or liver in general, wait even if you don't like liver give THIS a shot. It's a nicely thick piece of toasted (ciabatta? not sure but it had a lot of holes like ciabatta) bread spread with a perfect/non-skimpy smear of chicken liver pate. This is then topped off with sweet caramelized onions with a touch of balsamic vinegar for some acidity. I ordered a second one for myself after. The bread is perfect: grilled for crispy exterior, yet interior is soft and chewy. I didn't think the liver spread had that bitter liver funk at all. -Veal sweetbreads, creamed spinach, mushroom, capers, brown butter ($14): This was really tasty. Crispy sweetbreads (which is thymus gland haha) with the other components. There were also small segments of lemon which made the dish really bright and balanced, but there were twice as many segments of super sour lemon than needed. The portion is ridiculously small also. Three pipsqueak nuggets... -Char siu grilled quail, apple, pear, yogurt ($19): It hurts that this small dish (one quail cut up) costs 19 bucks. It's a really good dish. You have smoky succulent quail, with a sweet glaze on it, but it's definitely not cloying, then you clean that fatty, meaty, smoky flavor with the apple pear and yogurt combo. -Grilled baby broccoli, smoked trout, crispy egg, romesco ($12): This was my second favorite of the night. I wish all of their dishes were like this. Everything's there for a great reason, and in the end the it's freaking amazing. Crispy trout skin, a nice protein from the fish, a tart but not overly sour romesco, the grilled broccoli, and that fried egg...which was PERFECT. Runny yolks...mmmm :) I should have gotten two plates. :( -Foie Gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy ($25): This would have been off the charts delicious if it weren't for the disappointment of having a limp piece of foie gras. I wish the piece I got would have been scored to make it crispy when seared. It was also undercooked a bit. Also the biscuit was alright, you could have shoved a popeye's of kfc biscuit under that thing. I will give this another shot, next time I'm here. -Pig ear, chili lime, fried egg ($12): I thought the texture was going to be crunchy and hard like pork cracklins. Instead, the texture was crispy yet when you bit into them, they sort of collapse from being tender. Flavorwise it reminded me of how around where I live, at the Mexican market, people would eat chicharrones with hot sauce and lime juice. The egg was needed because the ear dressing with the lime and chili was tangy. -Bone Marrow with Caramelized Onions and Chimichurri ($10): This was actually a bit disappointing. Only because it was nothing worthy to crave or rave about. You could honestly make you own better bone marrow for a lot less money. The chimichurri did not at all balance with the caramelized onions which both engulfed the bone marrow in awkward flavors. It also needed some salt. Possibly less chimichurri would have been fine. -Veal brains, vadouvan, apricot puree, carrots ($14): I don't recommend this at all. This dish was definitely the LEAST favorite. Lacked seasoning big time. The brains were creamy and soft as expected but the blandness just made the experience unpleasant. I could have also use maybe some of those extra lemon segments from the sweetbreads here. -Pig Tails "Buffalo style" ($11): The pig tails themselves disregarding sauce were tasty. Crispy exterior and unctuous fatty interior. What killed the dish for me was the sauce on the outside. A yelper commented that the sauce was pretty much Frank's red hot or similar to it...I think Frank's red hot is better to be honest. This wing sauce was WAAAYY too damn sour for those itty bitty pig tails. And a tangy ranch doesn't make it any better. -Bacon chocolate crunch bar with salt and pepper ice cream ($7): The ice cream and bar were garnished with this powder with black specks, to sort of imitate salt and pepper I guess. It had the feel of cornstarch but when you eat it, it's ever-so-slightly sweet. Smart also, because if you put the ice cream on that, it won't slide  when melting. The bar had nice crunch from the bacon. The rich bar yearned for the sweet ice cream though, which actually had a hint of pepper. Overall, I would come back to try more menu items.

I would never come here on my own nor would I have gathered a group to go here, but I know someone that is ballin' outta control so you already know what the deally is. Had a reservation to eat, and even though we were a bit late, they were very accomodating to the situation because everyone was dealing with Thanksgiving traffic, which was borderline insane in SoCal this year. Anyways, all in all, the food was delicious, packed with flavor, although the sizes of the dishes weren't too agreeable with me (this is why I never go to these types of restaurants as the money I pay doesn't equal complete satisfaction to me, but you know how it goes. You go to these places to get wow'd, then go home to fill up till satisfaction). Chicken liver on a biscuit - This was my 3rd favorite. Very creamy, very flavorful, and the play on the old Southern classic was dope. Hamachi tostada - This was my 2nd fave. The whole Asian flavor fusion madness on top of a tostada? It was awesome! It was really fun trying to figure out ways to divide this dish amongst a group, but being an opportunist and a fat boy, I got to have the biggest piece. There is a LOT going on with this dish. Lots of ingredients, flavors ALL match and harmoniously punch your taste buds. It was a one bite wonder. Oxtail poutine - I've always wanted to go to MTL to try this signature dish, because how can you go wrong with fries, thick gravy, and cheese curds? Animal's rendition on this was awesome! Oxtail meat, #1, is one of the top cow meats out there and wow, they cooked that mofo to perfection. Flavors were so bold and savory. I wish I were high as fuck for this one. I'll be trying this dish in my own kitchen for sure. Balsamic ribs - Gross. It was a dish that wasn't finished. Way too sweet. Way too vinegary. You're eating ribs of meat that simply taste like seasoning. BBQ pork sliders - Good enough, but nothing wowzers. Nice fatty chunk of pork with good slaw but yeah, seems like an appetizer that can be served at Chili's or BJ's Brewery. Polenta with 6 hour bolognese - This was very tasty but it was maybe 3-4 tablespoons of food. Perfect example of paying a shit ton yet going home with a still-breathing appetite. That basque cheese or whatever with the burnt up bread - Bleh. Same as the polenta. I mean it's good yeah, but c'mon son, it's just melted cheese above onions and peppers. Make it bigger, my friends. All in all, good food.

This is a perfect example of how poor customer service will always outweigh good food.  From the poor experience of making the reservations, to how we were expected to stand outside because we were 15 minutes early even though most of the tables were empty, to the downright rude and crappy treatment we got from our waiter (the small thin guy with tattoos on his arms) - unbelievable.  In the end, the food wasn't that great and the experience was so bad that we left feeling totally disappointed and abused.  Definitely NOT recommended!  Oh, and, hey waiter guy - if you don't like working there and can't be courteous to people and passionate about the food, find a job somewhere else.

I love LA, if for nothing else, because it's a city of late night eating - something sorely lacking in the Bay Area. 11 p.m. on a Friday evening after a frustratingly delayed flight, we enter Animal, are seated immediately and are soon noshing on small plates of soft eggs, Texas caviar (black eyed peas) and Benton's bacon (my favorite from Tennessee). My husband couldn't resist the foie gras, biscuit maple sausage gravy and the bone marrow with chimichurri was a great way to couple meaty marrow with the vinegary flavor of the Argentine green sauce. A disappointment was that they were out of the burrata with tomatillo salsa. Other interesting sounding items that we couldn't justify at 11 p.m. at night was the balsamic pork ribs, pig ear with chili, lime and fried egg and poutine with oxtail gravy and cheddar. Way too heavy late at night, plus we needed to save room for dessert. The tres leches cake was a spin on the classic, with deep condensed milk flavor, which was super moist and a nice ending to an interesting meal.

"Changes & Modifications Politely Declined"  as they should be! In a city where people have a need to feel special, to have this with that, or have one of the many trendy food allergy/ diets... Too many people don't trust the Chef and or watch too much Food Network and think they know better!   I have a ton of respect for places such as Fathers Office that stands strong and doesn't serve ketchup or Animal where they politely refuse modifications!  Trust the Chef and if you don't like something that is in a particular dish than choose something else on the menu!  With all the amazing offerings Animal presents daily, you are bound to find something you love! My GF and I used to live off of Melrose and would frequent Animal regularly to basically have a starter course of the Foie Gras Biscuit and then work our way through the menu to either have the Bacon Chocolate Bar with Black Pepper Anglaise for dessert or Another Foie Gras Biscuit... Depending on how many other flavors we experienced in the middle. First about The Foie Gras biscuit... I've mentioned it twice!!  Gastronimically it's a stretch on making sense.  Your putting pan seared fat, on top of a biscuit levened with fat, covered in a sausage- cream (fat) gravy but cleaned up with a maple syrup gastrique. It's fat on top of fat on top of fat accentuating the obvious like a "fat girl wearing a thong!"  BUT I can honestly say, it is one of the best Foie Gras preparations I have ever experienced here or in NY!  It's so good on all the many trips, we have been interested in trying the Foie Gras Loco Moco, but why fix it if it ain't broke... Plus foie & spam?? Maybe for Don Ho to wash down with a glass of tiny bubbles, but we'll stick with our thong wearing fat girl! Other must tries: The bone marrow with chimichurri ALMOST as good as Blue Ribbon Brasserie in New York with there oxtail marmalade!  Also a must try is the crispy pig ear salad with fried egg on top... the dressing is super acidic almost like a Thai beef salad dressing made from lime juice, nam pla and chilies.  But once you break the egg yolk to release that perfectly running yolk to mix into and balance the salad you have pure crunchy ecstacy on your plate! The hamachi tostada is also a really nice favorite and light as well.  The pork sliders are good and safe, but with all the fun and interesting things on the menu, they take up a lot of space in your gullet!  i suggest skipping the sliders and choosing two more dishes instead or saving room for a Foie Gras Biscuit Dessert! One other mention is that the wine list is really obscure!  The varietal selections are all present and pair well with the style of cuisine offered.  However unless you know all the chic boutiques of Europe, I would suggest putting yourself in the hands of the servers, or even the busboy... I can't tell you how impressed I was when the busboy came over to ask how everything was and then suggested coming back to try the crispy rabbit leg next time and proceeded to describe the dish as if he cooked it himself. I hope next time we come back the rabbit leg will be available, however I think our next trip will be to Son of a Gun!  I heard they serve a drink called "The Last Word" over there... A drink created in the late 1800's at The Detroit Athletic Club (where my family were members for many decades) made from Gin, Chartreuse and a couple other things... Animal has not missed a beat even with a second location open!

Awww! With a name like Animal, I was wishing for a true Andrew Zimmern experience. Where are all the extreme dishes?! ;) What was supposed to be a birthday celebration at Chosun Galbee for a friend who ranked out on us turned into a casual dinner amongst  Thomas N, Mateo and I. Since they trust me sooooo much when it comes to trying new places, I volunteered Animal as our destination. I called an hour before opening and made a reservation for 6pm. No problem! We were promptly seated upon arrival. This is thee ideal time to dine here comfortably. Our server William reminded me of a tatted version of Adam Savage from Mythbusters. William was a really cool bloke. He was chill while waiting on us, but proper at the other tables with a lady present. CAVEAT: SERVINGS ARE EXTREMELY MEAGER!!! We initially had no idea what to expect as far as serving size is concerned because all the photos on yelp are deceptive. William explained that serving sizes were similar to tapas, so naturally we needed to order a bunch of food for 3 famished fellas. So we settled upon: 2 orders of BBQ Pork Belly Sliders, Alaskan Halibut, Poutine Oxtail Gravy, Flat Iron Steak, & Foie Gras Loco Moco. My bud Mateo was hoping for the Bone-in Rib Eye, but we were informed that it was no longer available on the menu. ;'( BBQ Pork Belly Sliders: 4.5/5 http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Super delicious and full of flavor, these sliders were extremely addictive, so much so that we wanted to order 3 or 4 rounds. Problem with that is it's $12 for 2 sliders. OUCH! Animal's slaw and BBQ sauce play well together. You'll fall in love with the thick cut of succulent pork belly. Alaskan Halibut with Corn, Wild Fennel, Chanterelle, and Lobster Butter: 2/5 http://www.yelp.com/biz_… We were sorely disappointed in this dish. Disappointed in the portion as it was about the size of an iPhone. Disappointed in it's preparation as it was overcooked. Disappointed as it was advertised as containing chanterelle but there were no traces of this mushroom. Flavor, oddly was lacking. Poutine Oxtail Gravy and Cheddar: 3.5/5 http://www.yelp.com/biz_… I really wanted to love this dish as the oxtail was perfectly prepared and was extremely tender, however, I could not get over the overall saltiness of this dish provided by salty fries, salty gravy, and salty cheese. Flat Iron Steak with Artichoke Hash, Truffle Parmesan Fondue: 4.5/5 http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Prepared medium rare, this was one of the most tender flat iron steaks I've ever had! Certainly was not worth the $28 price tag as the cut was slightly larger than an iPhone, but definitely one not to be missed. If you are not a fan of artichoke, you'll soon become one with this dish! The problem with the flat iron steak and the fondue is the cheese salty and slides off the steak, but sliding cheese is not THAT big of a deal, is it? :P Foie Gras Loco Moco, Quail Egg, Spam, and Hamburger: 5/5 http://www.yelp.com/biz_… This was the star of the night...but serving was super tiny for $35. The overall flavor of this entire dish was superb. The magic lies in Animal's use of spam and foie gras. It would have been nice to have an additional quail egg, but for the sake of presentation, one egg was sufficient. The foundation of perfectly cooked rice absorbed the gravy and was aptly portioned for this small dish. I wanted so much more of this dish and could have easily ate 3 servings of it! ^___^ So that sums up my adventure to Animal. Petite portions of fairly creative cuisine that's not too extreme, but tasty nonetheless. Expect your bill to be approx. $50-75 per person after tax & tip.

People remember - this is a niche restaurant. Wouldn't win for best all round but is one of those places that is well worth a visit. Menu is very interesting and there are some great dishes. Others have listed great dishes and I loved the pork belly sandwiches, chicken liver appetizer,  the balsamic ribs and hamachi taco. Took the chocolate bacon crunch bar for our 16 year old to try since he loves bacon. It's not a romantic place. Don't take people who are hard of hearing or hate noisy places. But if you like a cool vibe and a party atmosphere in a bare bones stripped down atmosphere -- this is great. I would definitely go back and what's fun is that since there are so many price points and you can eat small -- it can accommodate any budget. We brought our own wine and for a $20 corkage fee it was very reasonable. Some of the reviewers are like movie reviewers who think every film should be an academy award winning big picture film. This is like going to an art film where you want to see some amazing performances but it's not big budget perfection. Our waiter however was wonderful. She was very friendly and can't complain. But you need reservations people. This is a busy area on Fairfax so also be patient if you get there and they're not ready right on time. Go and have a fun time!

Wow.  Just plain wow.  Literally everything I had with a group of co-workers was outstanding. So unique and flavorful.  Great atmosphere, good drink selection (beer and wine), friendly staff.  This experience earned every bit of five stars.  Here is what I had.  Have a glance if you want and then book a reservation and make this restaurant destination visit a reality! *chicken liver toast 3 *burrata, raymundo's tomatillo salsa, olive oil 10 *pig tails, "buffalo style," celery, ranch 11 *melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread 12 *pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg 12 *barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw 13 *balsamic pork ribs, tomato & cucumber panzanella 18 *foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy 24 *tres leches, dulce de leche 7 *bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream 7 I'm pretty sure I captured everything above.  There was also a glass of water and a Maredsous 8 Brune beer involved at some point.  Surprisingly I was not in a food coma following this experience.  There was a enough of us to share everything that was ordered, so for the most part we ate responsibly.   Oh and I like the name of the restaurant.  Thanks!

As their 1000th review.. i will make them proud!!!! Be careful when you are going down Fairfax.. if you blink.. you might just miss an amazing adventure with your pallet! A couple of friends took Jeff B and I out for dinner and Animal was the winner. I bookmarked this place a long time ago and I am glad I am able to cross it off my list!! This is where my Anthony Bourdain senses come in a venture out of my box! It was all about the liver, the pancreas, the rabbit legs, the foie gras, and the chocolate bacon. This cute tiny doesn't have elaborate decor.. heck they don't even have a sign outside saying you've reached the place! It's just an address number and a door into a long rectangular room. We brought our own wine (of course) and the server was nice enough to pop it open and pour each of us a glass. First stop was the coconut sweetbread (pancreas) fried and served with a drizzle of mango glaze, some kind of herb aioli, and tamarind. Loved the texture of crunchiness and softness as you bite into each piece. Then we made a detour to the chicken liver toast which was surprisingly good! The flavor was very subtle and the sweet jam like sauce on top reminded me of a gourmet peanut butter and jelly sandwich?!?!?! Loved it! Then we took a wild turn and ended up with the pig ears! Fried then marinated in a chile lime vinaigrette .. that was all i needed for the night!!!! I'm guessing this was their take on your typical chicharones... but ten times better!! Balsamic ribs was probably the only thing close to normal. As "normal" as this dish may sound, the marinade really brought the flavors of the ribs out. Tender and soft.. more meat than bones... swirled it in some amazing concoction of a sauce and you're done!!! Rabbit Legs not as gamy as other meats. I actually really enjoyed this one very much.. even though it tasted like chicken. The presentation and the lemon aioli is what won me over! To the big finale we ordered the foie gras loco moco! The picture really speaks for itself and I will leave it at that.. other than the fact that I had an amazing food orgasm and couldn't stop smiling!!! Amazing flavor, amazing texture, and amazing idea!!!! Then we brought to a halt ... or so i thought.. then we ordered the chocolate bacon and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Average feeling on the chocolate bacon.. since I've had it at other places before.. but the sticky toffee pudding... WHAT THE HECK DID I JUST EAT... and little bit of EUPHORIA ended up in my mouth! The perfect toffee flavor infused in every single molecule of that bread pudding was pretty close OR was at perfection!!! Loved this place! Loved it... Loved it.. Loved it!!!!

There seems to be a penchant for over cooking many of their foods in the Animal/Son of a Gun empire.  At Son of a Gun which leans toward the pescatorial, overcooking fish is an ill starred disaster.  At  Animal, where the flesh of avians and mammals abound, over irradiation of infrared is a bit more forgiving so that the food rating of Animal is higher than at Son of a Gun. To its credit, Animal has sound baffling installed above on the two side walls.  It's still loud, but it could have been worse.  The interior is clean and minimalist so not much was invested in the interior design. The menu changes often so do not expect your favorite dish to be there the next month although I suspect that some of their signature dishes would remain. 1)  For the starter I ordered the "foie gras terrine, satsuma marmalade, braised endive, spice toast".  I couldn't taste any obvious spice in the toast, but it had a slight butteriness like a brioche.  I was amazed by the brilliant almost technicolor orange of the Satsuma tangerine confit.  If this isn't added food coloring, then I give Animal credit in being able to make a conserve using heat that does not dull nor fade the color the tangerine zest.  The tranche of terrine de foie gras was very rich with a layer of duck fat on top.  The terrine was very soft and velvety and was very fatty.  I suspect that they incorporated more duck fat into the terrine to create an softer, velvetier consistency.  If this is so, I'm wondering why they did that.  Was it to add more fatty richness to something that is already rich, or was it to "stretch" the foie gras so that more could be served for the same amount of foie gras??? Anyway, the waiter suggested a sweet wine called "Sainte Croix de Mont, Chateau la Rame, Grand Vin De Bordeaux" which was sweet, honey-like and smooth.  This wine description was not very informative in that it didn't list the varietals used.  I later found out this type of wine was called Vin d'Or de Bordeaux, and now is "Vin Doux", and the varietals used are probably Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc, and maybe Muscadelle. Also not sure if it had undergone "pourriture noble" or just desiccation of the grape in order to acheive its high sugar content. 2)  The main course was "duck breast, charred cabbage, liptauer, mustard".  The duck breast was execellent.  Meaty and full of Umami, not at all fatty, and surprisingly, for Animal, not over cooked.  The outside of the duck chunks was cooked, but the inner meat was still red.  Woo Hoo!   Liptauer is a type of cheese spread usually made from ewe's or an addition of cow's milk, and it was smeared on the plate.  This was the best duck I have had in a while. 3)  Warning! Warning!   Imminent Culinary Calamity about to happen!!!   I knew that the  ribs would be sweet from the menu description so this was to be dessert.  The details in the menu sounded good and reasonable on paper...."balsamic pork ribs, braised greens, chili oil, garlic".  Theoretically this dish should have been a WOWSER, but in practice, this dish was a bad piece of meat.   The pork ribs were over baked so that the meat was dry, hard, and lost its luscious meatiness.  The balsamic vinegar's sugars were caramelized, but lost its complex flavors when it was again over cooked so that it had a very monochromatic sweetness with no complementary flavors at play.   I asked for some Tabasco sauce to add a bit of gastric and spice to the meat to enliven it, but when I asked the waiter for a hot sauce of any kind, he replied there were none.   To make matters worse, the greens were hyper over cooked.  The poor leaf vegetable lost its "soul" and became a mushy, slightly bitter, old tasting thang.  This green reminds me of some of the overcooked vegetables in the cafeteria line of the Los Angeles School District of old.  (I'm sure many of you alumni remember the yellow green, smelly broccoli.) So I had the pork ribs boxed in a paper, recycleable, sustainable container.  :-) I had some BBQ sauce from Gus's in South Pasadena still in my fridge so I applied a Memphis style tomato sauce/brown sugar BBQ on the ribs, and the complex flavor of the sauce resusitated some of the dead flavors. My home made puree of fresh jalapenos and garlic helped too.  I also added the mustard style BBQ sauce which also redeemed the poor mushy greens.   All this totaled $104 tax and tip included which was a wee bit high for a restaurant with not much atomosphere and OK service.  I could have gone to Bistro Provence for an excellent 3 course French meal for about $50.  Or gone to Mako for some peerless, impeccable Sushi/Sashimi for about $60.  Colori in downtown LA for good, solid Italian for $40.    In terms of bang for the bucks, I feel that Animal is not a good deal, but it sure beats what they do at Son of a Gun.

So if you love trying new things related to meat and meat-ish foods such as foie gras, bone marrow, liver and pork-y parts  ...   coming to Animal would kinda be like if ... a sports fan went to a sports bar ... a smoker entered a dispensary ... you had yellow fever and came to a Yelp event - Yup, like that. For me, the space was something that could only be described as minimal yet dark and mysterious.  There's no signage on the outside so you're left with your imagination as to what you're getting yourself into. The menu has the current date on it which lead me to believe that it changes every so often with a few of the favorites in constant rotation. I came with a group of 8 so I was able to sample these items: marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar rabbit loin spring roll, eggplant, sprouts, green curry foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream And before I left you better believe that I uttered the following words: "damn all that shit was tasty" PS - yes I described the food as shit and still gave it 5 stars

I came here with high expectations, and Animal did not disappoint.  An open mind and kinky palate are required to dine here.  I had some hamachi, some bone marrow, some pig, and rabbit but the menu is constantly changing.  FGLM is the one dish that you will never forget.  It's hot, moist, and heavy.  It's dirty and classy at the same time.  Almost too decadent, but it's just the right amount of foie gras over salty spam and beef patty topped with a quail egg that's just runny enough.   I'm looking forward to Son of a Gun because I may flirt with meat but I get serious when it comes to seafood.

For now, I give it 3.5 stars because I feel I would like to try more to possibly give it a better rating as the other reviewers. This is definitely a tapas kind of place because each dish is super potent!! Some are way too potent for me like the balsamic bbq pork ribs. My favorite was the soft egg w/ texas caviar. Somehow all the flavors went well together and weren't overpowering. I liked the sweetbreads dish, but I really want to know what sweetbreads taste like without all the different seasoning and sauces. It could have been potatoes for all I know. The second dish i liked was the quail; it was plump and juicy. The sweet melon and apples complemented the tiny drumsticks and wings so well. I would love to try the other things like the veal brains, pig tails, pig ears and the poutine dish. Next time.

Animal is a great place to eat. Cool food. A bit expensive, but not ridiculous for what it is. Went with a date. We ordered... 1. Ricotta Gnocchi - was very delicious, maybe the best thing all night topped with black trumpet mushroom and a tasty liver sauce. 2. Tandoori Octopus - was good, but not great, probably the worst thing of the night. The plate looked really cool, but the flavors didn't seem to work well together. 3. Bone Marrow - awesome! topped with garlic, onions, and some spices. Served in a bone with two pieces of bread. It was amazing. This and the gnocchi are worth ordering again. 4. Flat Iron - This steak was good and the most filling thing of the night. Ordered it medium rare which was a good choice because it was very thick. The potato like "sunchoke" that accompanied it was just ok. Didn't order dessert because I've heard that it isn't too great there (went to MILK instead).   Overall I had a great experience. A couple things I didn't like, it's kind of in a whatever area and there is no sign (I guess they're too cool for that). Wait staff was amazing!

Only available reservations on a Saturday was 11pm, so my friend and I just decided to try walk in and was able to get a table after about 20 min. Food was very good. My favorite dishes were: -chicken liver with toast: which is big enough to be shared with 2 people -pigtails buffalo style: imagine crispy pig skin with soft meat in the inside, with the occasion bone, slabbed with buffalo wing sauce and some ranch. very good! -veal brain: how often u get a chance to eat this. I'm never eating this again  but was worth saying I've tried it. - foie gras loco moco: very good. who doesn't love a mix of quail eggs, spam, hamburger and foie gras over rice! -veal tongue: this one was underwhelming. Can probably be skipped. -bacon chocolate crunch bar: it's interesting with the bacon. Decent dessert but nothing to write home about. They also have 2 beers the size of wine bottles. Overall a very good meal.

The pork ribs are the best I've ever had. The burrata, raymundo's tomatillo salsa, olive oil is great, but they should serve bread to go with it (they do have it and they go great together). The tres leches is very tasty too. The staff is friendly and the seats are comfortable, but It does get loud and crowded.

Ate here on Sunday, April 15. I didn't make the reservation so I can't speak to the reservation system that some have comlained about. There was six of us total and we split 13 dishes plus we tried all four deserts. The bill came to just over $300 with everyone except me having at least 1 drink and we all went home stuffed and happy! Here is what we had Bone marrow - Excellent, wonderful chimichurri sauce Pig Tails - Meh Melted Petit Basque - I didn't live this but several people at our table did. Tandoori Octopus - Excellent! BBQ Pork Belly sliders - Wow! more please. :) (We got two orders) Shrimp & Rabbit Sausge springroills - Excellent! Ox Tail Poutine - Double Yum!! Balsamic Pork ribs - Excellent! Duck Breast - Excellent! (I know, boring.) Flat Iron - Very well cooked. Rabbit Legs - Not a huge rabbit fan but these were perfectly cooked. Radicchio and Cara Cara salad - Meh Of the four deserts I would say the consensous was that the carrot cake and the tres leches were the best. Overall this please was worth the drive from the LBC. I would go again tomorrow.

Awhile ago my friend made reservations to this place for her birthday. Unfortunately since everyone in our party was late, the reservation was given to someone else. I already knew what I wanted to order from the menu by this time as we were waiting outside so I was pretty disappointed when we all had to leave and go somewhere else. All I kept thinking about was "goodbye Fois Gras Loco Moco.."  :'( So for MY birthday we came back to eat here. Ordered the foie gras loco moco, fois gras/biscuit/maple sausage gravy, hamachi tostada, pork belly sliders, and tres leche cake. Everything was great and although I wanted to try more items (i love me some variety) I was so stuffed that I knew eating more would result to a horrible food coma and I did not want to pass out while driving back to Orange County. Service was great, no complaints, place is small and they are serious about reservations.  Def. coming here again to try the other goodies!

The food we ordered tonight: Pork's head--4.5 stars--it was the first dish came to the table, it would be the wooow dish if I don't compare it with the rest of the orders we had. :) Veal brain--4.5 stars--very rich flavour, definitely the right amount because I am sure I will get a bit sickery if eating too much of it. Pork's ribs--5 stars (or maybe even 6 out of 5!! haha)--such a bold flavor with the meat melting in your mouth once you taste it. Also a bigger portion comparing to the rest of the orders. Chicken liver toast--4 stars--highly recommend you to order one per head because its the cheapest one in the menu ($3) and you really cant split it. Marrow bons--5 stars--its not AS GOOD AS the ones my dad used to cook for me.but well, no one can compete with my dad, so i will let it pass. ;) If you are looking for the big, bold,rich flavor, you need to go to Animal. Even though the portions are small, you will definitely be satisfied with sharing 4-6 dishes between two people. Tip--please please do reserve a table before you go. We ended up waiting for 1 hour and 30mins because we forgot to book it for dinner. The line was always there since 6:30 till 9:30pm (the time we left the restaurant).

Food was amazing, had the kale salad which we took bites between dish to clean our palate. The bone marrow. Melted like butter on your tongue, pork belly was better without the bun, and the pig ears was delicious! The downside was the kitchen, there seemed to be a food mix up as we were served the marrow twice, sent back second time, then waited a long time for third entree with apologies from the waiter about the confusion. When the entrees came out, both the last two came out at same time leaving us feel rushed. I'm willing to go back again, my boyfriend has been before and said it was out of character as usually timing I the plates is perfect.

If you are ever in the mood for something that's bit unusual, here is the place to be.  As the name implies, they serve animals on the menu.  Not just your average dishes either.   Foodies of bone marrows, pork belly, pig head meat rejoice.  Even if you are not a foodie, you would enjoy the great taste.  The portions are not big, so they suggest sharing. The only wrinkle to the great dining experience for me was the long wait between our courses.  Since it was my first time there, I hope it's not usual.

Amazing food but wayyyyy expensive Our room mate's brother was in town from the Bay Area so we decided to tag along for their trip to Animal.  I didnt know anything about it other than people seemed to really like the food.    Right away we ordered about 5 plates and the first to come out was the BBQ Pork Belly Sandwiches...... these things are incredible.  Super tender with tangy BBQ sauce and 'slaw.  They are everything you could ever want in a pork sandwich.  Im almost upset those came out first because they really were the star of the night.    Probably second best on the list for the night was the foie gras biscuit - which just about blew my mind.  I couldn't believe the favors that came out of what was on this plate!  Awesome.  The foie gras loco moco with the quail egg on top was pretty incredible as well..... all the plates were really good.     So now for the bad.  The place is damm near deafeningly noisy.  I was having problems hearing the person across from me.  All of the walls are exactly parallel and there is nothing on the walls to diffuse the sound so its just very loud.      The cost; prohibitive!   For the four of us, 5 dishes and two drinks it was almost $200.  I nearly fell out of my chair when I saw the bill.  We were splitting it three ways but holy crap, are you kidding me?  Don't get me wrong - the food was incredible, but for those prices there is a very strong possibility that I may never go back unless with a group.

Happy Birthday to me!!! When my mom and dad offered to take me to dinner for my birthday I couldn't help but get crazy excited about the idea of eating at Animal. I had been oggling the reviews and drooling all over my computer for months now and it was finally happening. When we got there I realized that I had actually been there before. The restaurant is so tiny and unlabeled that even when I was across the street I didn't realize it!! This time, armed with an address, we arrived on time and hungry for our reservation. I was glad that I came with my family and not with just one other person; it afforded us the opportunity to try many a delicious dish. The staff was friendly (not overly so) and capable. The man who was busing our table between courses and replacing our plates and utensils was SUPER!! He was blowing my mind with his efficiency. Loved it. Every dish we had was bursting with flavor. I was quite the happy camper by the end of our meal. I can't remember everything we ate but I will try.. The Oxtail Poutine was probably my least loved dish of the night. It was still very yummy and full of flavor but it was a little too dense/salty for me. Don't get me wrong, we licked that plate clean, I'm just saying I loved other things more. As sad as I was to be gnawing on a rabbit leg this dish was beautiful. The flavors were perfect and the presentation was gorgeous. The legs were crispy and so tender. Yum. Pork belly sliders for the win! This was one of the best dishes of the night. It was so tender and so perfectly fatty and I sucked on my fingers after every bite. The coleslaw on top of the tender meat and in between these soft buns was a great balance to the pork. It was crisp and fresh and creamy. Oh. so. good!!! Balsamic Ribs. These were absolutely melt in your mouth delicious. Even though my brother was hogging them the whole time we still very enjoyed it. This is not a low calorie meal but it's my birthday darn it!! Asparagus. The asparagus had been peeled into strips so it was a little hard to recognize but it still tasted very yummy. There was some sort of bacon or crispy meat mixed in so it was not as light as asparagus typically is but perfect. We also had some fish that I want to say was Halibut and of the Alaskan nature. I'm sorry that I can't remember but it was very good. For the finally we had the sticky toffee pudding. The dessert was the least stand out of the whole evening. It was weirdly/absurdly tiny and not really amazing just okay. Even though this meal was roughly $200 I felt like it was totally worth it. It's not an everyday experience but it's definitely worth a special evening like a birthday or an anniversary. Maybe I'll come back for my 24th!!

Animal has no exterior signage, and we would've missed it if it weren't for my phone GPS. The restaurant is small and crowded, so reservations are nearly required. The interior is simple yet polished, with large windows or dim lighting (depending on the time of day) creating a very warm and comfortable atmosphere. The restaurant is known for serving exotic animal parts. The menu changes daily with the exception of a few classics. We basically let our server order for us since (I'd hoped) he'd know best. For our party of seven, we had: Chicken liver toast - This little appetizer was my favorite dish of the evening. The liver was creamy and very flavorful, and the balsamic topping added a nice sweetness. The toast balanced the dish out with its mild taste and contrasting texture. Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - This deluxe comfort food was a table favorite. The subtly sweet gravy pulled everything together. Pig ear - I thought this was just okay. The pig ear was very crispy, much different than the crunchy and gelatinous combo I'm used to. The application of lime was interesting, and the egg added a necessary milder, creamy component to the piquant dish. Hamachi tostada - This was the lightest dish and probably the least special one. Even still, it was tasty, and light and refreshing. Bone marrow - Fatty bone marrow spread on toast. This was rich and delicious. The chimchurri and caramelized onions added a nice kick! Lamb neck - This dish wasn't memorable, but the lamb was very tender. The fava beans and radish supplemented contrasting, crisp textures. Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - This is basically a deluxe version of chili cheese fries. Heavy, but scrumptious! BBQ pork belly sliders - As I'd expected, the pork belly was very heavy, oily, and unctuous. I definitely would've like more cole slaw to balance the dish out. Boring. Foie gras loco moco - This was rich, savory, and delectable. Very creative. Foie gras terrine - This was my least favorite dish of the evening. The sweet terrine was paired with Asian pair and black pepper, creating a sickeningly sweet combination. It was like eating a slab of sweet, fatty butter. We ordered all four desserts: Bacon chocolate crunch bar - This was my least favorite dessert. Considering the hype, it was disappointing. It was basically a very salty chocolate nut bar, and the creme anglaise overdid the richness. Sticky toffee pudding - Yum! The spongy texture was perfect. Tres leche - Tres leche is a type of sponge cake soaked in three types of milk. This was mildly sweet, and I highly enjoyed the soft crumbly texture. The thick frosting and dulce de leche (caramel sauce) were the perfect compliments. Berries, vanilla custard - This was basically a parfait on a dish. The lavender cookie crumbles were my favorite component. We ordered one of each dish, with the exception of two. Our server recommended two chicken liver toasts because of it's small portion, and two poutine fries... Because of it's huge portion. Okay, I'm not really sure why. Our bill came out to be $280 including the 18% gratuity added to parties of 6 or more = $40 per person. Not bad, considering we were all full. All in all, the food was enjoyable, but once is enough for me.

One of the most amazing meals I've ever had and prices were reasonable. The small plates were perfect for sharing between our party of 4.  I'm sure everything is amazing on the menu but I had the following and loved every one of them. Poutine oxtail gravy, yellowtail collar, fois gras maple sausage gravy, polenta bolognese, crispy pig's head, hamachi tostada, bone marrow with chimichurri and caramelized onions.

Great service and good food. I really enjoyed the experience.   The best dish in the menu is the pigs ear with lime and chile and fried egg.  The flavors that dish hits are amazing.  I really never expected to enjoy pigs ear that much.   The atmosphere is plain and bland.  The service is casual and very good.  The food is daring and impressive.  It's pushing the line on good food.

Not sure how long it's been around but I'd never heard of this place until late last year..boy, have I been missing out. My brother had gotten me a gift certificate for Christmas and I thought it was a joke to celebrate the end of my vegetarianism..or as he likes to call it, the Dark Days. From the name alone I was half expecting meat sensory overload..slabs of steak and haunches of unidentified game being roasted over an open spit. Not quite. The reality is ever so much more delectable. In actuality, Animal is a restaurant with a pretty sophisticated menu, one that changes daily. From what I've seen, there are some items that are kept in rotation but others make an appearance and then are retired to make room for newer creations. The fleetingness of the food adds to its appeal..a little of the live-in-the-moment quality that makes eating good food one of life's pleasures. The decor is minimal, but you won't even notice once the food arrives. The surroundings fade into the background in the presence of succulent bites like foie gras with biscuit and maple sausage gravy or alaskan halibut with corn, wild fennel, chanterelle and lobster butter. I'd have liked to sample everything they had but prices tend to be inversely proportional to serving size, ie. not enough food for way too much $$... so be ready to drop some cash for this gastronomical experience. My vegetarian days definitely behind me, I'll happily be back to savor the culinary goodness that is Animal. Thanks, brother, for ushering in a new era of omnivorous delights!

*avoid this restaurant if you don't do well with "exotic" animal parts (liver, bone marrow, pig ears, pig tails, etc)* Have an open mind at Animal, YOU ANIMAL. It was my sister's 21st birthday and she was indeed an animal.     Food Networks "Best Thing I Ever Ate (with bacon)" featured the Bacon Fudge Crunch Bar. (I need to stop relying on that show..) I've yet to find a bacon + dessert combo that works. If you're not a big fan of sweets or DO like subtly sweet things, this is perfect for you. Note: the bacon bits were kinda peppery! Order a couple of items to share (tapas style). These plates are way too rich and too small to enjoy for only yourself. -  Hamachi Tostada: Crispy tostada with Hamachi sashimi layered beneath tart and lemony greens, topped with fried onions and dainty little flowers. Flavorful dish and not to mention, elegant! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… -  Foie gras + maple sausage gravy + biscuit: I felt guilty eating this fluffy fatty cloud, but I truly loved this dish upon my first bite. After the foie gras is gone, you're left with an maple-ly, overly sweet biscuit, where my sis + mom couldn't handle. Definitely worth a try. Fluffy fatty fun ^____^ -  Foie gras Loco Moco: General crowd pleaser in my party.. spam, foie gras, quail egg; what a genius idea! The beef burger patty on the bottom was smoky. Mini dollops of Sriracha around the plate, thank you! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… - Bone Marrow with Chimichurri: I like the fatty texture of bone marrow, but I always find it a waste of money to dig into a bone for a tiny morsel to spread on bread. BUT this dish was saved by the tasty chimichurri and caramelized onions on top. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… - Balsamic Pork Chops: My sister and I say SKIP IT (too sweet)! My brother said it was the best ribs he's ever had. To each his own~ -Chicken Liver Toast: If you absolutely hate liver, do not eat this. If you absolutely love liver, eat this.  Because this DOES have that raw, liver metallic-y taste, they didn't add much to this paté. *4.5* for my whole experience. Would I be back? If I ever feel splurgy and suddenly want to drown myself in fatty foie gras, then YES.

This is hands down my favorite restaurant in LA. In the past four weeks, I went here four times and sadly to say, I am foie gras-ed the hell out. ¡No mas! I'm done! Finito! I refuse to go back for their succulent, buttery, rich, fatty liver piled high on crumbly/powdery/flaky (is this even possible?!) biscuits. Or on their unconventional rendition of a Hawaiian staple, the loco moco. My favorite dishes that you have to get each and every time you go: BBQ Pork Belly Sandwiches - FATTY and accompanied with a deliciously creamy slaw. The bun (which I consider to be the most overlooked component of a burger/sandwich) is top effen notch. I could eat 4 of these in one sitting. And I have. Foie Gras Biscuits - The foie gras is huge. It's buttery. It's delicate. It's succulent. My mouth is literally watering right now at the thought of it. The biscuit? Indescribable. It's not flaky. And yet it is. It's kinda powdery and yet it's not. It's definitely crumbly. The maple sausage gravy? I want to pour it all over my body. I could have two of these dishes in one sitting. And I have. Hamachi Tostada - Love this dish. Hamachi is flavorful but not overly pungent. The fish sauce is very damn near close to how my mom makes it. The herbs/salad on top with peanuts... now that I think about it, this is my mom's Vietnamese chicken salad but with hamachi and a big tortilla instead of chicken and fish chips! This is the closest thing to authentic Vietnamese in all of LA. And I say that coming from a family who owned a restaurant for over 10 years. What's up with Vietnamese restaurants here in LA that don't serve tendon in their pho?!?! Ps. I love my mama. Foie Gras Loco Moco - At $35... this barely made it on the list. But how the hell do you pass up a combo of egg, foie gras, spam, hamburger meat atop rice, gravy, and sriracha? Give me egg, foie gras, spam, hamburger meat, and sriracha anything and I get weak in the knees. The only thing I don't like about this dish is that their gravy is too runny. I'd prefer a thicker and more substantial gravy and a full-sized poached egg instead of the quail egg. Still yet, this is a must have. Tres Leches Cake - Hope you saved room for dessert. How do you pass anything up that's been soaked in condensed milk? Answer: You don't. Other notable dishes that I dig: Chicken Liver Toast - Liver is great. Slightly creamy, slightly sweet. Toast was not my favorite. Overall, still good, especially for only $3. Marrow Bone - There is A LOT of marrow in these small bones, more than bones three times as big. The toast is thick and buttery, very good. Chimichurri is a little much. Sometimes this dish comes out a little too salty but majority of the time it's on point. Pig Ear - Lovely tang to this dish. Wished it was crispier though. Asparagus - This dish was surprisingly good. I've never ordered a vegetable dish before but when this came out, we all agreed it was a great last second choice. The egg is somehow crusty-breaded poached. The asparagus was shaved and plenty flavorful. Dishes I didn't care for: Poutine with Oxtail Gravy - This dish gets recommended left and right. By Yelpers, by friends, and by the Animal staff. It was underwhelming and not at all memorable. If you want fries, go to Chego instead and get the Ooey Gooey fries, add sliced pork belly for effect. Crispy Pig's Head - Breaded and deep fried headcheese. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't a memorable dish either. Pass. Balsamic Pork Ribs - I love me BBQ. I was intrigued by the description. I ordered it and two ribs came out thick with sauce. I was excited. I bit into it. It was good. Then it sunk in. Too salty. Flavors were too plum or hoisin saucey for me. No me gusta. For the price I paid for two ribs, I wanted a half rack of baby backs at least. Alaskan Halibut - Good but again, not memorable. Try it if you like fish but it probably won't be a go-to menu item each time you visit. There are still a bunch of menu items I've never tried. Even though I sad no mas, I meant no mas to foie gras. You best believe I will be back to Animal. And when I do, I'm starting off with the Hamachi Tostada and the BBQ Pork... and maybe a Foie Gras Biscuits. And then I'll try the other dishes I've yet to try. GO TO ANIMAL...EAT!!

For the love of meat. While I have been really good about going veggie for GOOD Magazine's June challenge, I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to connect with my carnivorous side when I was recently invited to Animal. Instead of sharing small plates, we each ordered individually, though there was a lot of bites here and there from plates that were not my own. From the rabbit loin spring rolls to the oxtail poutine to the foie gras loco moco, I died and went to culinary heaven. So many items that literally melted in your mouth. Smooth in taste, rich in flavor, and exquisite in presentation. After meddling in others' plates, I was then presented with my dish du jour, the flat iron steak ribboned with a truffle parmesan fondue over a bed of artichoke hash. It was the equivalent of getting knocked out by Mike Tyson...it doesn't happen every day and when (or if) it does, you relish in the moment and cherish the experience for the rest of your life. Yep, one of those dishes. Meat me there.

I literally spent weeks trying to decide on a restaurant in LA to celebrate a milestone birthday.  Living in New York for the last 7+ years has made me a raving lunatic when it comes to food and I admittedly scoffed at the idea that there could be BETTER restaurants here.  Even as I walked into the restaurant, I braced myself to be ever-so-silghtly disappointed. Dear Animal, you have single-handedly restored my faith in the LA dining scene.  I apologize for having any doubts about my homeland.  Could I please have some more piggies and Tres Leches? Here's the rundown... Food: -Hamachi Tostada with Herbs, Fish Sauce Vinaigrette, Peanut Waiter recommended, perfect texture combinations, very light and a great way to start the meal. It was like having a very well-organized tartare. -Potato Agnolotti, Caramelized Onion Butter, Parmesan Imagine the ideal bite of mashed potatoes but enveloped in a beautiful pasta coated in caramelized onions, butter and cheese.  Yeah... Mind. Blown. -Melted Petit Basque, Chorizo, Grilled Bread Technically, it's melted cheese on sausage with toast.  But, the best melted cheese on sausage with toast you will ever put in your mouth.  This was recommended over the burrata and we did not regret our decision.  Salty, crispy, crunchy, gooey, awesome... -Bone Marrow, Chimichurri, Caramelized Onions I love bone marrow.  But, I've never had it with chimichurri.  It should always be served with chimichurri.  Forever.  I just drooled on my keyboard. -Foie Gras, Biscuit, Maple Sausage Gravy Our waiter said that when he eats at the restaurant, he orders two so that he could eat one and the rub the other one all over his body.  He added that the first time he took a bite, he immediately punched the chef in his face.  Those sentiments rang true for the entire table.  The foie was seared perfectly.  The biscuit was possibly one of the best that I've ever had.  The gravy was complex without compromising its integrity - it still tasted like gravy.  Just really awesome gravy. -Barbecued Pork Belly Sandwich, Slaw I didn't expect much from this dish.  If you've had one BBQ pork slider, you've had them all, right?  This is completely untrue.  Crispy, tender pork belly with barbecue sauce containing the perfect balance of sweetness, salt and vinegar.  Even the bun was good.  I was completely floored. -Heirloom Tomato, French Dressing, Olive, Hard-boiled Egg, Garlic Croutons We needed a palate cleanser after all that delicious food.  This was light and did the job.  It was a touch over on the olive but the textures and flavor combinations were lovely. -Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar, S&P Ice Cream Party. In. Your. Mouth.  This was stunningly good.  Also, salt and pepper ice cream is amazing with bacon chocolate candy bars. -Sticky Toffee Pudding, Marscapone, Orange I love sticky toffee pudding.  If it's on the menu, I'll order it every time and this one was sublime.  The orange was a nice touch.  Really well done. -Tres Leches, Dulce de Leche It's hard to find good tres leches.  Tears welled up in my eyes after the first bite.  Hell, I wanted to punch the pastry chef.  Definitely one of the best tres leches I've ever had.  Ever. Wines: -Lessona Rose Nice accompaniment for dinner. -Cremant Jura Wanted some bubbles.  Got some bubbles.  Liked the bubbles. Once every few years, I have a meal that literally makes me curse after every course.  This was definitely such an occasion.  "Holy sh*t, that's effing good."   Service was seamless.  Our waiter was knowledgable and spent just the right amount of time at our table.  One of my dining companions is a chef and he went back to personally thank the kitchen.  If I still lived in LA, I would spend all of my money here.

This was the best dining experience I've ever had and for what it's worth, could be my favorite restaurant of all time. I don't want to give it the top spot yet, but I can't think of any restaurants right now that are any better. I have never been so content with a meal. I want to go back already and try the rest of the menu. The waiter starts out by recommending that we order anywhere from 4-5 dishes and sharing them between two people. Great idea. 1.) Foie Gras with biscuit and gravy: This was easily my favorite dish of the night. The foie gras tasted incredible. It had an earthy flavor typical of foie gras, but it wasn't overpowering. The liver was cooked to utmost perfection. It was so perfect, that it tasted like butter melting in your mouth. The biscuit tasted like corn bread, but more moist. You cut a piece of the foie gras, with the biscuit and gravy, and its seriously heaven in your mouth. No freakin joke. 2.) BBQ Pork Belly Sliders: It didn't blow me away like the foie gras did, but this dish was also great. You could taste the tenderness of the pork, as well as the fatty belly portion of it, with a sauce that doesn't make you forget what the meat tastes like. 3.) Hamachi on a tostada: We actually got this dish first. The hamachi (yellowtail sushi) is supported by the tostada and topped with a fresh slaw. It was a fresh and light appetizer of sorts that opens up your taste buds. 4.) Chicken Liver Toast: This was also bombay. If you like pate, you will love this dish. Get it. 5.) Veal Brains: my least favorite of the dishes, only because the texture was a bit weird and I couldn't really taste it. It was kind of slimy in your mouth. 6.) Sticky Toffee Pudding with Marscapone: this was good. just get it. trust me. Almost forgot about the drink I ordered. I had the coconut porter beer. This is the best beer I've ever had. Imagine if Newcastle and Guinness had a baby, and this is what you get. Dank.

There's no sign on the door, but Animal has been very popular with the carnivores since they opened. Despite it looking empty, there were no tables free - I had left a message on Monday for a reservation, but they never got it. Luckily, we arrived just as they opened, so there was seating left at the bar. The menu is dizzying, filled with animal parts I've never heard of. Small plates, ranging from $10-$35. We got a few dishes to share, starting with one of two vegetarian options - the shaved zucchini salad with pecorino, purslane, and sungold tomato; Smoked trout salad with corn vinaigrette, benton's bacon, and crema; Hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, and peanut... My friend ordered the foie gras with biscuit and maple sausage gravy. I wasn't too keen on eating goose liver, but I did try a bite. And then another one. (This actually wound up being my favorite dish.) Finally, the barbeque pork belly sandwiches with slaw.  This is one the restaurant's most popular dishes; a little too fatty and vinegar-y for me. But all in all, the food was terrific! I definitely want to come back with other meat eaters and taste more.

I would give animal a 2.5, but it definitely doesn't deserve over that. My boyfriend had been wanting to go to animal for months, so we finally decided to go. We were both very excited for this meal and were really hoping it would go well. Here is my review: Food: (3) 1. Chicken Liver Toast (3.5) pretty good, but nothing absolutely spectacular. 2. Crispy Pigs ear (4) It was very good, but some bites had a TON of lime and was rather inconsistent. 3. Bone Marrow (5) Absolutely awesome, couldn't have been better. 4. Poutine with oxtail gravy (2) This was okay for about 1 bite, but was so rich that I could hardly eat beyond that. The flavor was just okay and had something a little off. 5. Flat Iron Steak with potato hash (2) The steak was of okay quality, pretty tough. It was covered in cheese and had a sauce that was incredibly rich and tasted a bit like chocolate. The steak was SO rich. The 'potato hash' wasn't a hash but some undercooked hard fingerling potatoes. they were awful. The steak was VERY small and not good for the price. The waiter said 2-3 dishes each, but we could have gotten away with 1-2 each (probably 1.5 would have been perfect). Service: (2) 1. We got seated right away, although in the worst table in the house. 2. Our food came at random intervals and it took way too long between courses. 3. They CHARGED US FOR TAP WATER. It was only about 20 cents per glass, so it was really more of a slap in the face than an actual charge. But WHO CHARGES FOR TAP WATER??!!!?! Parking: (2.5) 1. Street parking is hard to find. 2. There is a valet for $5 Ambiance: (1.5) 1. The restaurant has no decor and is rather plain and uninteresting. Plus, they cram as many people as they possibly can into the space. Prices: 1. Our meal was $90. 2. It was too expensive for what it was, not very good food or atmosphere, and they charged us for tap water! Overall: 1. We would not go back 2. Although we had a few good dishes, save your money and go elsewhere. The atmosphere, service, food, parking, and prices were not a good combination. There was nothing that REALLY stood out. 3. it was okay, but there are definitely better places.

Animal is my favorite restaurant, ever.. I'm not super big on atmoshere and ambienece.. and Animal didn't really much to impress in these areas anyway. Its small.. and a bit loud.. but none of that stuff matters once you try the food. Went there for a special night with my gf.. and really glad we did.. great special date spot. Our waiter was charming and really made us feel comfortable. I already had an idea of what we should order but he helped reinforce all the choices.. The only slight drawback was.. I noticed the food took a bit longer than I had expected.. but regardless.. We had: hamachi tostada - we'd both eaten a lot of raw fish, hamachi.. in a variety of ways. this dish really blended a number of layers of flavors really well.. and it blew us away.. really a great start to the meal and.. we actually wanted more of it. bbq pork belly sandwiches - so good.. i mean a slider is a slider but.. their sauce was great.. and the texture of the meat was primo. bone marrow with chimichurri - one of their unqie specialties.. id had bone marrow before.. but not celebrated the way they they were able to with their preparation for this dish. it will be something we order every time we're back. foi gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - for me, the highlight of the dinner.. it literally left us speechless. i dont know how much more of it i could eat because of how rich it was.. but it was a perfect way to end a spectacular meal. the combination of sweet and savory was achieved perfectly.. and the gravy really was a great background for the falvors. another dish I will order every time I come back. i consider myself a bit of a foodie and ive eaten at some great restaurants.. for me none of them top animal.

Animal gets 3.5 stars in my book. It's an enjoyable place to dine if you're looking for something a bit out of left field -- but it's not somewhere I would frequent often. While the food was good, it felt to me that the restaurant was more interested in the novelty of "strange" ingredients and preparations than it was in the food itself. This isn't to say the quality was bad -- but I got the vibe that it was shock value first, taste second. The conceit is cooking with animal parts traditionally eschewed in American society as gross .... think sweetbreads., pork belly and ear, tongue, and so forth. I grew up in Asia and have eaten all sorts of "gross" things (by American standards) so I am not very squeamish and maybe the concept was therefore not as novel and exciting to me. A few stand-out dishes were the hamachi tartare and the foie gras w/ biscuits. We had a number of other things that were good but not great .... chicken liver flatbread, pork ear, something with a fried egg, short ribs. And the fish we tried (halibut?) was decidedly underwhelming and bland. I was underwhelmed by the decor as well. It's fine and all but not particularly ambient. So too with the wine list, with dessert ..... good, but not great. I'm glad I went and it's the sort of place one goes to once to see what the hype is all about. But I don't plan to go back anytime soon -- while everything was for the most part competent and often solidly good, I can think of lots of places with much better food, location, decor, etc.

My "Best Thing I Ever Ate" friend has been telling me about Animal's bacon chocolate crunch bar since forever. She finally booked the reservation for a get-together, and I was surprised they were able to comfortably accommodate our party of 8. I was able to find street parking (which is free after 8 yipee!) right out in front.  As other Yelpers have warned, you can only find the place by knowing the address or knowing that it's right next to Supreme. We decided to split the party into two groups so that it would be easier to order. My side ordered: -CHICKEN LIVER TOAST (4): When I asked the waiter how large it was, he said it was one piece and made the size of a cracker with his hands.  We decided to get one each since it's only $3; however, when it came out, it was fairly big!  The size of a girl's hand! While it's tasty, the liver taste was too much in the end and my girlfriends all scraped it off--no offense to the chef! -POUTINE: Deliciously marinated oxtail gravy and cheddar cheese over fries--YUM!  Large portion so it'll be enough to share; definitely recommend -BBQ PORK BELLY SLIDERS:  There's two sliders per order, so we did two orders.  Delicious fall-off-the-bone type of meat with crunchy, crispy cabbage, all encased in an extra soft bun. -FLAT IRON STEAK: My friend who had been to Animal before recommended this, and I'm glad we followed her advise!   Melt-in-your-mouth medium-rare steak in a creamy truffle parmesan fondue with artichoke and potatoes! Definitely recommend this one as well. Last, but not least, we ordered the BACON CHOCOLATE CRUNCH BAR with S/P ice cream, which to our surprise, really meant, SALT & PEPPER ice cream!  The bar is dinky, and we shared it with the entire table.  Yes, all 8 of us.  However, it was enough.  We just wanted to sample it.  It reminded me of a ganache bar with bacon bits. The ice cream was, while interesting, too peppery for my taste.  I wish they would mold it in that oval mound-like shape like the fancy-schmancy places. The total was surprisingly only about $25/person for us with the 18% gratuity.  Good, prompt, and friendly service.  Solid 4 stars.

The waitress told us it's family style. She suggests 6 of us to order 2 dishes and we can all share. We started with 9 different dishes. When the food came, we were like, "Family style? Is it just for newlyweds?" The portion is fairly small and difficult to share. Anyway, all dishes are unique and delicious. We ordered rabbit spring roll, veal brain, pig ear, bone marrow, sweetbread, poutine with oxtail gravy,  veal tongue, rabbit leg, and Foie Gras+biscuit+maple sausage gravy. The taste is very special! The presentation is beautiful! It took us almost one month to get the reservation for party of 6 on a Saturday evening. It was totally worth the wait!

This place is worth a visit. The food is made to share and come in small portions. Each dish could feed about 2 people. Great flavor, small bites, high price. Each dish ranges approximately from $12-$30. Nothing special about the ambiance, no decor just 2 wooden mini sculptures on the walls. Simple but gets busy. Not even a sign outside. Reservations are needed. Heres my take on our dishes: The fois gras on a biscuit is a must try! it was definitely my favorite of dishes.  sweet but salty and creamy. perfect blend for the taste buds. Poutine with oxtail was overly salty, i don't recommend it even though the waiter did. It is the most filling dish there but nothing special at all. Pork sliders with coleslaw another must. perfect in lightness and heaviness on ur belly. Soft and savory yummmyyy pig ears with the fried egg is another you should try. The mix worked great, had a blend of spicy and tangy to spark ur senses. I would recommend this one for the 4 dishes, and 2 drinks at $7 the bill came out to a $100 to give you a sense of what to expect. Food comes out one dish at a time, and long breaks in between. Frankly I am not a fan of that so we asked to have it brought out all at once after the first dish.

- Make reservations:  the restaurant is not too big and it is still very popular, so you should probably call a couple weeks in advance if you want to eat at a reasonable hour. - Dishes here were pretty awesome, but as people have remarked, very meat intensive.  I dined with two others and since we had already eaten before, we only went with 4 dishes, which was more than enough. - Pork belly sliders are amazing.  Poutine is also really good (a little salty for my tastes though).  BBQ pork ribs are good, but I wouldn't get them again here.  Bone marrow with chimmichurri sauce was awesome - great flavor to it.

Hey Animal! You so fine, you so fine you blow my mind! If you love unique and inventive dishes, this place is for you. Animal attempts to take the oft discarded parts of meat that respectable restaurants goers would snub their noses at (not me though, I'm Chinese :)) and turn them into culinary masterpieces. You MUST make a reservation here to avoid a minimum 2 hour wait.

Simply great food. The foei gras with biscuit and maple sausage gravy was incredible as an ensemble although I have had considerably better quality foei gras. I also love the marrow bone with chimichurri and caramelized onions....it took a lot of will power for me not to grab that bone and just sucking and licking it... i am sure my wife was grateful that I had good self control. :o) The shrimp & rabbit sausage spring roll with eggplant, sprouts and green curry was also terrific..it has so many layers of flavors that just keep on adding depth and suprising you...as a matter of fact..this is true for every single dish I tried..they are all very well balanced and thought off and the bottom line is they simply tasted amazing. The crispy pig's head with pickled vegetable aioli was also a nice twist and has a wholesome taste but they are not in the same class as the three mentioned above. Hamachi tostada with herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette and peanut was nice and refreshing but I have had way better version of this dish...morimoto's version was better and Bev's sashimi napoleon put both of them to shame...hmmm it's time to go back to maui it seems... Oopppss...before I slipped into dreaming about enjoying sashimi napoleon at the general store, I better talk about dessert. The sticky toffee pudding with mascarpone and orange was nicely done and very adult; I do enjoy the texture and the perfect temperature it is served at but the dessert that blew me away is the berries with vanila custard, lavender crumble and opal basil.  Holly crap...this was crazy good...my mouth is confused in such a good way. Who knew that I actually love the taste of lavender with a hint of basil??? This might get weird when my massage theraphist come over and used lavender oil.....I don't really want to start thinking about food.

I have been waiting, WAITING to try Animal.  I've heard about Animal from a few people and heard nothing but good raves about the food.  I starved myself for a week only eating salad and grains so that I could feast my palate on the delicious food that Animal serves.   First, the food is amazing!!!   The food was rich in flavor as I imagined it would be.   I am so glad that I starved myself!!!!  Eating the delectable dishes at Animal was like have a food-gasim in my mouth.  So good. My friend and I ordered the veals brain, the pigs tails, the marrow bone chimichurri, bbq pork belly sandwich, the coconut sweatbread and the crispy rabbits leg.  I enjoyed all the dishes ordered.  Although, my friend had a hard time eating the veals brain, but I did not.  I have never eaten brains before so I wasn't sure what it would taste like.  To me, it tasted like "puffy" air that melted in your mouth.  It was delicious. The marrow bone chimichurri and bbq pork belly sandwich is a must to order.  Both compliment each other.  However, I loved the rabbits leg.  It crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  If I did not want to be civilized, I would have put down my fork and knife and used my hands. The food serving size is small and meant for sharing.  As for the space, it is a small restaurant and the noise level can get very loud.  My voice doesn't usually carry well, so I noticed raising my voice when I spoke to my friend. The service was good.  For dining at a peak time slot, our dishes came out in a pace where we didn't have to wait, and wait and wait for our food to arrive.  Our waiter was considerate to check on our table during the busy period.   Also, they have cute hostess. Animal doesn't have a sign, so you have to look for it as it can easily be missed.  Or, you can look for the a bunch of people waiting outside trying to get a table.  It's best to make a reservation in advance.  That's called thinking on your feet. I plan to return to Animal soon.

2 Words.. FUCKING ORGASM! I vote this restaurant as one of the most interesting restaurants I ever ate at. Interesting part being the concept and style of the way they select their food on their menu and the presentation. Everything that I tried on their menu had its own unique taste, it was very unpredictable and I loved it! Let me go down the itemized list: Bottle of House Wine- Not on the menu but totally worth the price (I'm all for getting plastered at a cheap rate) chicken liver toast 3 barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw 12 marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions 10 foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger 35 tres leches, dulce de leche 7 ALL HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Trust me, I know a cool spot when I see it. Love this place! The only con was the location. I think we circled around like 10 times trying to find the front of this damn restaurant. It is very easy to miss but just look for the valet stand. :]

We went here on a friend's birthday excursion. Having recently partaken in the lovely delights of Sun of a Gun together, we decided to give Animal a whirl on her big day this year. It's a tiny, sparse location that fills up with the noise of nearby companions. Food is served small plates style and the restaurant has a casual/comfortable vibe. It's all about letting the food and conversation shine. Our evening started with the asparagus, crispy egg, pancetta vinaigrette, parmesan dish. The vinaigrette was light and fresh, and the egg arrived whole and while it had a crust, wasn't crispy per se. The asparagus though had a firm crunch to each bite, which isn't necessarily my preference as I like my asparagus more on the soft side. Overall, I would say this was the weakest dish of the evening, especially considering it sounded so promising. The hamachi tostada also had this nice light quality to it, but unlike the asparagus, it felt like every flavor component was singing a madrigal directly to me. The peppers (I believe serrano) provided a little heat, while the slaw brought some texture to the dish. The cilantro and fish sauce vinagrette danced together in harmony. Second favorite dish of the evening. Barbecue pork belly sandwiches arrived next and these spelled out L-O-V-E across my tongue. The pork belly was melt in your mouth divinity, the bbq sauce was light enough that it didn't overpower and the bun had a generous amount of clarified butter. Shook and Dotolo know how to put together a sandwich like nobody's business and this was hands down the north star of our evening. This succulent dish still haunts me as I type, my mouth watering up in a hunger that swells inside. The potato agnolotti, rabbit sausage, broccoli and olive oil was delicious. The agnolotti was velvety and rich and broke apart like little nuggets of joy with each bite. The sausage was tasty, but ultimately just sausage, and I don't know that the rabbit really brought anything to the table. The balsamic pork ribs with a tomato and cucumber panzanella was our third stand-out dish. Honestly if the tomato and cucumber panzanella was served as a stand alone it would have been my favorite overall that we tried. That salad had this beautiful dressing that tied everything together in a simplicity that was just spellbinding. The pork ribs were sweet and nicely glazed and cooked to that perfect fall-off the bones consistency. A very strong dish and a solid end to our savories. For dessert we opted for the dish that everyone and their mother is ordering, the bacon chocolate crunch bar with ice cream. The crunch bar is definitely crunchy, but just too much chocolate flavor for me. I would have preferred a bit more salt to the whole dish, however the powder across the plate is amazing. Animal makes for a nice night out and I find small plates to be a wonderful opportunity to really partake in a restaurants offerings. Animal's menu evolves with the seasons which means you can always find something to try. I prefer Son of a Gun, but both restaurants are worth the price of admission so make your reservations in advance and be on time!

Good god, you can eat til you flip out and the dinner is affordable!  Too bad I don't live in LA anymore, I would be here at least once a month. 4 of us came by for a 9pm dinner, led to wait with a menu outside, not a good layout for such a popular restaurant - we tried to head to the bar while we waited but that wasn't encouraged.  They could be rolling in thousands at the bar from waiting patrons. Anyhow, I don't think they're hurting though :) Our grand opus was the following: 6 chicken liver toasts - I love chicken liver paté and they do it well. Marrow with chimichurri - overly salted, but cooked perfectly. Pigs head - good, but a bit gamey poutine - amazing cod - it's a meat joint but that fish was amazing sweatbreads - jizz worthy melted petit basque with chorizo - it's sausage and melted heavenly cheese, I didn't think to melt a petit basque but it turned not divine rabbit - hubby ate it, not a rabbit kind of gal pork belly - perfect

I LOVE ANIMAL, and i will continue to come here monthly as long as i live. the most filling thing on the menu is the poutine with the ox tail meat. if you want to get full get that. my favorite is the bone marrow, I wish i could have 3 orders of that for dinner. the foie gras on the biscuit is really intresting combination of flavors that is worth trying. for dessert, get the oatmeal cookie with berries and opal basil. its lovely in your mouth. service is wonderful and the men are really cute :)

I can honestly say, "I've had better".  Animal is more like a 3.5 - 4.0 star restaurant.  The reason why I didn't give them 4 stars is because our waiter flat out lied to us for something...that is inexcusable, but more on that later. We decided to go to Animal on Christmas Eve of 2011.  It always sounded like a good plan waiting to happen for years, but we've never really gotten around to it till recently.  It was, surprisingly, busy for a Christmas Eve.  I thought it would dead and we'd have only a few tables to contend for the attention of the staff (e.g. waiter, busser, etc.).  Unfortunately that wasn't the case.  Too bad for us since there were only 2 servers, 1 busser/food runner, 2 hostesses, and 1 person behind their bar area that I took notice of.  Not enough, in my opinion, to deliver exemplary service commendable for a restaurant that holds a 4.5 star rating on Yelp with over 1,000 reviews.  To add to matters, I had a reservation at 8pm but our table wasn't available for quite some time because a group of socialites decided to take their sweet time and crowd the table for hours on end.  I think the hostess finally decided to stick us at a table by the entrance, near the hostess stand, and within striking distance of a gush of an unexplainable chilly wind coming from the outside Los Angeles night air on a Christmas Eve.  We weren't bummed about it at first because we were expecting awesome food, but now that we've experience a big let down...I feel bummed about.  That was messed up! What did our waiter lie to us about?  Well he told us that we (the people in my party) only ordered 1 CHICKEN LIVER TOAST ($3) when we all clearly heard my brother order 3 orders of the chicken liver toast.  When only one was delivered, I kindly asked him what happened.  He, basically, told us, we didn't order 3 orders of the chicken liver toast because when he read off all our orders we didn't acknowledge it was 3 orders.  So, what...?  I guess he just put us down for one.  3 is 3.  3 does not equal 1.  Why am I so bent out of shape over toast?  Well, that's the best thing they have that isn't part of Animal's dessert list.  We did get our other 2 chicken liver toast afterwards.  But now that I think about it.  I should have savored that toast a lot more... Here's what our party of 4 ordered: - 3 CHICKEN LIVER TOAST ($3 a piece) - BONE MARROW, CHIMICHURRI, CARAMELIZED ONIONS ($10) - BURRATA, RAYMUNDO'S TOMATILLO SALSA, OLIVE OIL ($10) - PIG EAR, CHILI, LIME, FRIED EGG ($12) - HAMACHI TOSTADA, HERBS, FISH SAUCE VINAIGRETTE, PEANUT ($15) - VEAL TONGUE, SMOKED FOIE GRAS, PASTRAMI SPICES, CRAB APPLE ($13) - FOIE GRAS LOCO MOCO, QUAIL EGG, SPAM, HAMBURGER ($35) - 2009 BUTTAFUCO, Bruno Verdi, Oltrepo Pavese ($54) - STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING, MASCARPONE, ORANGE ($7) - BACON CHOCOLATE CRUNCH BAR, S&P ICE CREAM ($7) I'll tell you what I love...as if you already didn't know.  The chicken liver toast is pretty damn good considering it's only three buckaroos.  I was most disappointed with the foie gras loco moco.  The foie gras tasted pretty good, but the loco moco part was just off the mark.  If that's loco moco, then I don't think I'd want loco moco in Hawaii ever again.  Everything else tasted pretty OK, although I was disappointed with the bone marrow with chimichurri.  The bone marrow was small, and their was only one piece of it.  It's a far cry away from Blue Ribbon's (@NYC) bone barrow, and a small step away from Church & State's bone marrow What makes Animal the Animal I expected it to be definitely is not in their namesake.  My highest praise for this restaurant is their desserts.  We had four to choose from that day and we chose two.  We chose the one that everyone rave's about, the bacon chocolate crunch bar, and the sticky toffee pudding.  Believe me when I say, "WOW!".  Those two desserts were immaculate.  Possibly a Top 20 for me, maybe even a Top 10.  It definitely can fall in the ranks of Michael's Genuine's Tangerine Creamsicle Pot de Creme, gelato in Italy, Cream Pan's strawberry croissant, etc..  I'd definitely come back to Animal just for those two desserts. You guys might think I'm a hater, but one other thing that gets to me is the fact this restaurant tries to act discreet like it's some secret place that only the super cool get to go to at a rave or something.  Yeah...it doesn't work for me.  Can I get a sign please.  The number 435 just ain't working for me or the fact that the restaurant is mentioned to be near Canter's Deli.  Be your own entity and show off your goods.  I'd love to see a big fat sign that says "Animal" with maybe a pig next to it.  Just a thought...

Truly in love with their food! But be warned! Book early!!! Tried making reservations a month ahead and the earliest seating they had was at 9:30 PM? Really? But yes, it is worth the first try! So we decided to come right when they open and hope to get earlier reservations or get a seat. Nope! They are strict about their reservations, but luckily the bar up front has a few seats and we were able to grab seats there and cancel our late reservations. The food: - Bone Marrow w/ Chimichurri (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! SO GOOD!) - Pork Belly Sliders (Pretty darn good!) - Poutine Fries with Oxtail Gravy (Holy macrow! SO GOOD! But heavy entree) - Hanger Steak (alright....but the cheese gave it a nice kick!) Service: Every seemed "stoned"? haha Everyone seemed really relaxed and in a "hippy"state. Everyone was friendly, but could've been more attentive. Overall: Highly recommended! Something different and delicious!

This has to be on the top of my list for amazing food. The dishes are adventurous but aren't so crazy that you would never give it a try. Just walking into this small minimalistic place gives you a sense of mystery. You aren't really sure what you are about to get into as if the menu could be a complete surprise and yet you still will decide on something and devour it. Before I get to the meats, they do have a very nice selection of wines if that's what you are looking for. I went with one of the small selection of beers they have....Stone Brewery's Belgo Anise Imperial Russian Stout. This dark, heavy coffee-like beer was a perfect way to start my meal. I felt like I was transported into a Medieval Feasting Hall about to dine on whatever animals were caught that day. It seems if you have never been here before, they will recommend you order 4 dishes to share between two people. I really think 3 will do or even 2 if you order the Loco Moco. Especially if you are complimenting your meal with a Beer or Wine. Dishes we had: Pork Belly Sliders Bone Marrow and Toast Oxtail Poutine Foie Gras, Maple Sausage Gravy and Biscuit You can read all about the first three in everyone else's reviews. I'll just say they were all fantastic and would order them again. But the Foie Gras Biscuit....I have to recommend that 100%. This dish was on my mind for several days after I tasted it. Just thinking about it and I can relive the experience. This dish surprises your tongue with all its different flavors. The gravy is sweet and salty from the Maple Sausage. The biscuit is light and flaky even swimming in the gravy. on top of all that is a generous piece of Foie Gras. There is nothing like it. Next time, I'm not sharing that dish...sorry. We sat at the bar so the service was fantastic because there is always someone there serving you food, water, helping you with your selections, filing your glass when its low, and asking how your meal is. I could see into the kitchen from where I was seated and I was sure I would see an entire farm of live animals back there. A testament to the quality of the food and for the unusual animal parts that needed to make some of their dishes. Definitely a big fan.

I am an animal lover. I think they are delicious. Animal has been on my eating family's (aka SPAMily) list of must-try restaurants for a long time. Why did it take us so long to come here? No frickin' idea. We came here for a late reservation and it was still packed. We ordered almost the entire the menu for the five of us. While I do not remember exactly everything we ordered, the dishes that I remember dearly are: Chicken Liver Toast - Perfect texture and flavor without tasting too "livery". Marrow Bone - Generous amount of marrow with perfect accompaniments. Oxtail Poutine - I love poutine, but now will have trouble enjoying it outside of Animal. Hamachi Tostada - Crisp veggies, fresh fish, seasoned perfectly. Barbecue Pork Belly Sliders - So good that we ordered it twice. Balsamic Pork Ribs - Fall-off-the-bone tenderness. Foie Gras Biscuit & Gravy - Foie Gras! Foie Gras Loco Moco - Foie Gras and Spam! (The two Foie Gras dishes are very different. If you enjoy the texture of Foie Gras, I suggest the Biscuit & Gravy. If you appreciate the flavor more, I suggest the Loco Moco) They also have a good selection of drinks. A couple in our group had some beer which they fell in love with. I opted for their house wine (which was great) because I did not want to filled up by beer; I wanted to eat! It is nigh impossible for me to pick a favorite out of all these, as I'd be happy with any single one of these dishes to be my last meal. Actually, no. I will want to combine all of these dishes into one and create one epic mega-meal. After which I will gladly take my own life as there would no longer be a reason for me to live.

The Skinny: Animal is incredibly smart comfort food without the pretensions. (5) Service: prompt efficient service but the ambience is pretty loud (4.5), Despite some odd pricing for certain items, the unique flavor combinations and seasonal products makes Animal a must-hit in the LA area... pricetag, $150ish for two without wine(5). After polishing off two foie gras entrees at Animal, the hubby turns to me and says "I just think I f@#$'d up my liver royally." "Was it worth it?" "Hell yeah." That about sums up the experience at Animal. This is a place where vegetarians need not apply and the food is uncompromisingly good. The ambience is lively as diners commune and savor the wide variety of small plates that are featured that day. We started off with the foie gras terrine, prune puree, strawberry gelee. While the terrine and strawberry gelee were very good, the astonishing thing on the plate was the prune puree. This ain't your grandma's prunes, folks. Mellow, mildly spiced and exotic, it paired so well with the richness of the foie. Next, the potato agnolotti, rabbit sausage, broccoli and olive oil. The textures of the filled pasta were balanced perfectly by the flavours of the sausage and broccoli. It was an extraordinary dish. Hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, parmasean followed the alaskan halibut, corn, russian kale, and green garlic. The tostada was a revelation - I never really thought that there were a lot of similarities between Mexican and Thai cuisine. But put those ingredients on a plate, it was an epiphany. The cabbage salad (the Thai component similar to a green papaya salad) paired well with crunchy richness of the avocado smeared tostada. The halibut was definitely on the lighter item on the menu. Although decidedly well-balanced and well executed dish, it lacked the creativity of some of the other offerings. Foie gras biscuit with sausage gravy, maple syrup was a big hit of the evening. When I read the description, it was like WTF - is this an advertisement for Lipitor? Then the dish hit the table and I was sold.The biscuit was perfect - not too gummy in the middle, not too soggy from the gravy. The sweet subtle smokiness of the maple sausage gravy accentuated the luxuriousness of the foie, hitting all the right notes along the way. Barbeque pork belly sliders with slaw were stellar - had that perfect balance of bun to filling. Creamy slaw, melt-in-your-mouth pork, what the hell ain't there to love? For kicks, we started off with the bacon crunch bar, S&P ice cream (for folks who don't know, salt and pepper). Sporting a praline component, the bacon was actually delightfully mild, and added a nice crunch to the texture. S&P ice cream really showed off the floral hints in the pepper and was unexpectedly delicious. After taking a bite of the tres leches cake, the hubby exclaimed, "Finally! A place that got it right!" A deceptively simple dish - a sponge cake soaked in three different milks with an even texture that holds up despite the liquid - difficult to execute well. It was sheer joy to have this dessert. All things being said, there are some minor issues at Animal. Some dishes, such as the halibut, seemed a little too small for the price while others (ie, foie gras terrine) were ridiculously generous. The space is cramped and quite noisy as well, making it difficult to have a decent conversation even when you're sitting across from one another. Barring those issues, Animal is one of the must try restaurants in LA.

Ahhh.. Its been ~6 months since I dined here, but I still reminisce about the insane gorge fest that took place the day after Christmas. And even though I felt like a heifer afterwards, I had an awesome time chowing down! :D This is what we had: Pig ears with chili, lime, fried egg- Good starter. Felt right at home with this dish. Pigtails "buffalo style" with celery & ranch- Yes, I like to eat werid sh*t. :P Marrow bone with chimichurri, caramelized onions- I thought I felt my arteries clog up after downing this. Kidding. Fatty and rich, but I still wanted more! Haaa-ha! Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy- I love my foie! This was excellent. Foie gras loco moco- I'll say it again, I love my foie! But with spam?! Damn, who would've thought?! Great dish. BBQ pork belly sandwiches, slaw- AHHH.. This is something everyone must try. Perfection. Poutine with oxtail gravy & cheddar- This put me over the edge! It was ok, a tad over-salted for my liking. However, it did bring back happy memories of my trip to Montreal. :)

I really do like the food here and it is quite wonderful. So let's start with the food: Chicken Liver Toast -I wish I had just ordered 5 of these. They're only $3 each and worth every penny. Bone Marrow - Meh, the chimichurri kind of overpowered the bone marrow. The two components also seemed distinct and separated from rather than complimenting each other. This was somewhat forgettable in comparison to the toast. Flat Iron Steak w/ Truffle Parmesan Fondue -Oh so tasty, but oh so small! I asked for my steak medium rare but it came more medium. Not the best steak I've ever had (there are better places to go for steak in LA), and the truffle flavor was lost to me in the meal. My friends had: Foie Gras Terrine -Yummy buttery goodness, but I think the seared foie gras would have been better. Unfortunately, they had ran out of it that night. Too bad. Thai BBQ Quail -Aww man, this dish was so puny. It was soo small like where is the quail? Oh... there it is. It looks like a teeny weensy little ant on the plate. I see it now. Dang, so small. It was tender, but I'm not sure what was "Thai BBQ" about it. Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar w/ Salt and Pepper Ice Cream -This was quite delicious, but not "The Best Thing I Ever Ate." (The Chicken liver toast on the other hand...) But okay, this was still a wonderfully enjoyable dessert. There is lots of bacon and a good crunch, but I felt it was not wide enough to truly experience the textures to their full potential. The salt and pepper ice cream is just as good as the bar. It is truly fabulous and unique. Sticky Toffee Pudding -This was standard, yummy, but not mindblowing. The reason this place doesn't get 5 stars: They were a bit rude to us when we entered. They couldn't seat us even until our 4th person was there, even though one table seats 4 and there was no one else waiting to sit down. The portion sizes are truly very small. I mean SMALL! I had 2 appetizers, an entree and a dessert... and I was still hungry afterward!!! Seriously??? I am a girl. Yes, I can eat like a man, but still, I am a girl.  I was still so hungry afterward I went to Canter's to get a croissant. And I have never done that before. NOTES: -Pretty hard to find parking even later at night, but there is some street around if you look. Otherwise, valet is 5$ -There is no sign in front of the restaurant, so you wouldn't know it was Animal unless you knew the address. It's right next to Canter's though and just look for the restaurant with the black walls outside.

I realize my rating will be lost in the sea of positive reviews so I'll make this quick. The food is salty- very ridiculously salty! And the main ingredient of everything is butter. The ideas for the dishes are great. Execution terrible. Pork Belly Sliders- It was good, but I've had much better pork belly before. The edges of the pieces of pork belly were dry! How do you make fatty meat dry? I don't know but dry. Also, the richness requires the coleslaw to have a refreshing element to it. But it didn't. It was just salty! Ox Tail Poutine- braised oxtail sounds great right?!? It should have been, if I could only taste the other flavors besides SALT! All I tasted was salt and couldn't enjoy any other flavors than salt. Bone Marrow- The over salt once again ruined a dish that should have been great. If the chimichirri sauce was more tart than salt, it would have been amazing. Loco Moco- a fine way to ruin a piece of fois gras. Super salty dish. Fois gras was completely overcooked making it rubbery. It was a real shame. Basically, if you're up for eating overly salty foods drenched in butter, then this place is for you. Otherwise, save your money and go somewhere that respects it's ingredients. Why bother using local farm ingredients if you're just gonna throw salt and butter all over it. Honestly the whole place is just a shame. It should have been wonderful, but instead it was awful and disappointing.

Made a stop here while passing LA, what a great choice. We didn't make reservations, so tried to make it early enough to have a seat at their bar. After being seated, I couldn't decide on what to get on the menu! Soo after debating: marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions- this was very good, the chimichurri was the star. melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread- this was like a cheese dip with layered pepperoni. The gooey goodness went well with the toasted bread. barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw- nice thick cuts of belly in my belly, wonderful. coconut sweetbreads, raita, mango, tamarind- this came out fried, very good and all the sauces complimented each bite nicely. foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy- biscuit and gravy topped with foie gras, how could you go wrong? The first few bites of the gravy was a little over powering of sweetness to me, which was different since gravy isn't normally sweet, but after a few more bites, it just tasted better and better. Topped everyone with some wine and that was dinner. What a great dining experience for those who are scared of new things. This place is the place to try it because you won't know what your eating, cause it tastes that good! See you again Animal.

I have no doubt that if Jules ate here he would have hip opinion of filthy animals changed. No clue what I'm talking about? Pulp Fiction. Still no clue? Here... Vincent: Want some bacon? Jules: No man, I don't eat pork. Vincent: Are you Jewish? Jules: Nah, I ain't Jewish, I just don't dig on swine, that's all. Vincent: Why not? Jules: Pigs are filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals. Vincent: Bacon tastes gooood. Pork chops taste gooood. Jules: Hey, sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know 'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal. I ain't eat nothin' that ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces. Vincent: How about a dog? Dogs eats its own feces. Jules: I don't eat dog either. Vincent: Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal? Jules: I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy but they're definitely dirty. But, a dog's got personality. Personality goes a long way. Vincent: Ah, so by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal. Is that true? Jules: Well we'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig. I mean he'd have to be ten times more charmin' than that Arnold on Green Acres, you know what I'm sayin'? The pig ear is delightful. The fried egg was perfect and the crunchy crispy ear was a great surprise. Petit basque is a cheese i like so I was really happy to see it on the menu in a melted lava like form with chorizo and grilled bread. It's good, nothing mind blowing and odds are that you will burn your mouth to eater beware. Molten cheese is a dangerous cheese. The poke belly sandwich is good, it's probably the best one I've ever had. Were the two small sandwiches worth the price? I'm not so sure. There was a plate I can't remember the name of, it pretty much amounted to small ravioli filled with cheese and covered with a sauce and then black truffles were shaved over the top of it. If you see something like that on the menu while you are dining, get it. I wanted to pick the plate up and lick it. My lady got the flat iron and she said it was one of the better steaks she's had so that a good thing. We skipped the bacon chocolate bar and had the berries with vanilla custard, lavender crumble and opal basil. I liked it quite a bit. It was a light finish to what was a heavy meal. We had the tres leches as well but I wasn't a fan. It was good, but it wasn't anything that blew my mind. So, I saved the best for last because if you didn't read my entire review then you don't deserve to know about the wonderfulness that is the foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy. Do yourself a favor and get it. Don't cry about it being foie gras and not liking it. Just get it. It will change your opinion and you will crave it. I took a bite and a smile came across my face. I couldn't stop it. I tried to stop smiling as I ate it but it just made me smile more. It's so freakin' good.

My coworker raved highly about this place & he believes it is THE best tapas place he ever had. Aiitey ... so my friends & I made reservations prior & went on a Friday night. We were warmly greeted & seated~ Personally I think it's a lil overhyped.  I love tapas but there really wasn't a single particular dish that stood out for me. Since there are sooooo many reviews i'm just going to rate each dish on a scale from 1-5 with 5 being the highest. ~Crispy Pig's Head - - -  2.5/5 ~Potato Agnolotti w/ rabbit sausage - - -  2/5 ~Baby Kale - - -  2.5/5 ~Poutine - - -  3/5 ~BBQ Pork Belly Sliders - - -  3/5 ~Foie Gras Terrine, Prune Puree, Strawberry Gelee - - -  3/5 ~Chicken Liver Toast - - -  4/5   (couldn't help to say this but it kinda tasted like pb&j, still yummy tho!) ~Marrow Bone - - -  4/5 ~Bacon Choco Crunch bar - - - 3/5 ~House Cabernet ($20/bottle - what a deal!) - - -  4/5  :D Food is good & the portions were just right. Some dishes was unique but it was not amazing. Service was kind of slow. The interior decor was very simple looking.  Aside from that, this spot is worth checking out at least once.

This place rocks!!!! Amaaaazing!!!! Oxtail Putine!!!!!!!! I am mostly vegan, rarely eat meat, especially not strange meats, but at this place no rules or morals apply. I don't come here everyday so I am happy to break all rules when I do because this place is phenomenal! What an experience! Make sure you have a reservation. My friend and I did not have one, thinking it wouldn't be so bad on a weekday and we ended up having to wait an hour to be seated, and when we finally were seated it was a the bar, not a nice dining table (though the experience was still very cool at the bar since this place lends itself to high-end bar food very well) it was actually a plus to have the bartender recommend dishes and we had clear view of the kitchen from our corner in the bar so we could see the creative fare as it left the kitchen through the bar and onto tables. They have a seasonal menu though some staple items such as the Oxtail Putine are consistent staples. Not a great place for strict vegetarians since there is not many veggie options, even he desserts contain some sort of meat in them. Even though they specialize in red and gamey meat, their fish is perfectly cooked and flavored. Décor is minimalist, light, clean, bright with natural lighting. White tablecloths set a good backdrop for the visually interesting dishes.  Very busy, very loud, always full. An absolute experience. Great place to impress a significant other on a date, especially if your significant other is a meat eater/meat lover. Same chef/owner as Son of a Gun (another fantastic LA restaurant), Animal was the first opened specializing in red meat/gamey dishes and Son of a Gun came seconds specializing in Fish.

Easily the best meal I've had in LA.  Sorry Mozza . . .  you know I love you, but this place is as good as it gets.  As a recent NY transplant, I've been dying to find a restaurant that compares to the big hitters in NY.  And Animal is exactly that . .  .  out of this world good food, and creativity and passion in the making.  I sat at the bar and let the bartender know I was a foie gras lover.  He recommended the foie gras-maple sausage-biscuit and gravy dish.  This dish was a revelation.  Fun, delicious, and rib-stickingly good.  The Foie gras was creamy along with the cravy and the texture of the biscuit was divine with the meatiness of the sausage.  Awesome.  I then had the pork belly sliders and they were rockin . . . also tender, creamy, and fatty . . .  bomb!  I finished off the night with a tres leches for dessert.  I was a little disappointed in it, but then again I'm from Miami, but they did a decent job with it.  It felt refined, and wanted them to indulge in it the way they indulged with their savory dishes.    I was there on a Tuesday night at 6:30 and was able to get a bar spot pretty easily.  This place is one of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time.  I can't wait to go back.

Sometimes I like to try to sound cool to my vegetarian and vegan friends and say things like 'I often toy with the idea of giving up meat,' or 'really, I only crave meat like once a year so I'm basically a vegetarian.' Then I got to a place like Animal and I have to admit to myself that it's all BS. Because my meal at Animal was one of the happiest moments of my recent eating life, and I happily dove into every weird dish that was placed in front of me, from the buffalo style pig's tail to the sweetbreads to the poutine with oxtail gravy to the foie gras moco loco (which marked my first return to foie gras in about two years). It made me realize how much I really do love meat when it's made with care and love and creativity. My favorites of the night included a cavatelli with duck sausage, chicken liver spread thick on a big piece of toast and the lamb neck. My absolute favorite was the marrow with an amazing chimichurri with the most fluffy brioche toast on the side. I had a bit of a caveman moment there, scooping that gooey marrow straight from the dinosaur-sized bone and loving every moment. Our server was also super helpful, though he recommended we order about two dishes a person and it ended up being waaay too much food (not that we didn't finish it all). The space is dim and minimal so as to focus your full attention on the intricate dishes of the evening. I'd recommend skipping dessert to save room for one more savory dish, though we shared a tres leches and it was yummy... just not mind blowing like a lot of the other things we'd just had. Also... $20 bottles of house wine that weren't bad! A cherry on top of one of the best meals I've had in a long, long time!

My partner and I made reservations for 11:30 last night and I was a bit worried that the service would be lacking since they close at 1am.  But, for the most part, it was pretty solid service with only a few minor hiccups.   My guy likes to eat a lot, and I mean a lot, of food in general and I like variety, so we decided on 7 wonderful dishes: 1) Kale with lemon vinaigrette and crouton: This was super yummy!  The lemon vinagrette was a combination of tangy, spicy, and sweet all rolled into one.  The seasoned crouton was a perfect addition, as was the shredded parmesan cheese.  They gave a very generous portion.  In fact, it was such a large portion that I didn't want to finish it for fear of getting full.  Our server, however, clearly wanted us to finish it off, though, because everytime we'd push it to the edge of our table, he'd push it right back into the middle.  After a good 5-6 times of this, we finally caved and just ate the rest of it. 2) Pig ears with fried egg - My boyfriend ate this one on his own and he really enjoyed it.  The chiles gave the dish a fiery kick but the runny yolk of the fried egg helped to offset the zing.   3) Pig tails - My boyfriend also took this one on his own.  He seemed to really enjoy these buffalo-style oinkers, but had a hard time eating all four pieces just because the tails were super fatty (not a bad thing, that's just how they are in general). 4) Cavatalli with lamb sausage: yummy!  The creamy, peppery sauce really helped to bring out the flavor of the lamb.   5) Pork-belly sliders - this is one of their staple items and seemed to be the most popular last night.  I only had a bite of it because I really have a hard time eating fattier meats, but it was a good, solid bite.  My boyfriend was a little less impressed, describing these as: "the McRib of upscale dining."   6) Poutine, ox-tail jam: Oh.  My.  God.  This is one of the best dishes I think I've ever had.  So cheesy.  So flavorful.  One word: orgasmic. 7) Thai quail: this ranks as my second favorite of the night.  Very crispy, juicy (which can be difficult to achieve on smaller birds), and a nice mix of flavoring.  Very savory. Our dessert was wonderful, but sugary/chocolatey goods rarely get on my bad side.   This place doesn't come cheap, but it's well worth its pricetag.  So just go, you know you want to.

The place was booked two weeks out but I didnt have two weeks to wait so I arrived there upon their opening on a sunday night.  I waited 1 1/2 hours. I had mixed feelings if it was worth the wait.  The hostess was really nice and made me feel better about the long wait.  I ended sitting at the bar and the service there was great.  No complaints there.   The chicken liver on toast was great.  A little salty but bread was toasted just right.   The bone marrow w/toast was good. Don't remember much about it.   The fois grais over mashed potatoes was the favorite of my date.  I wasn't blown away by it.  It was extremely rich and thought it was a bit odd for it to be over mashed potatoes which was very creamy but good.  The fois grais was a bit too tender for me and didn't compliment with the potatoes in my mouth.  I've had better.   The bbq pork belly sliders with slaw was my favorite.  The meat was tender on the inside and had a slight crisp on the outside.  The bbq was very rich and full of flavor which I liked.  Slaw isn't one of my favorite things to eat but I will when I have to.  This was no exception.  It was much better than your typical market type but I could of done without it.   Overall, the place was small and a bit dark which is fine if you're on a date.  Otherwise I would not go.  Definitely make reservations.

DF took me here for my birthday, and it was one of the best meals I've ever had. We ordered the chicken liver toast, BBQ pork belly sliders with slaw, bone marrow with chimichurri sauce, basalmic glazed pork ribs, foie gras biscuit and maple sausage gravy, and finally the flat iron steak with white truffle cream sauce and sunchoke hash. Chicken liver toast - it tasted oddly like pb&j.  The liver had a really creamy texture that stuck to the roof of my mouth and had a slightly nutty flavor (reminiscent of peanut butter) and the onion marmalade was sweet, rich and tasted like sweet jam.  It was oddly satisfying. BBQ Pork Belly - one of my favorites.  The brioche bun was soft, the pork belly was fatty and tender while the bbq sauce was smoky, sweet, and a little tart.  The slaw was very light and cut through the protein of the meat and tangy bbq sauce. Bone Marrow with Chimichurri - This one was by far one of the best bone marrows I have ever eaten.  The bone marrow was so incredibly rich and creamy while the chimichurri sauce was very herby and fresh and complemented the incredible richness of the marrow.  If you have never tried bone marrow before and you're a fan of fatty meats/lard, this is for you. Eating this was basically like slurping pureed fat.  Heaven.  The toast the dish came with was also quite crisp on the outside yet still soft on the inside.  It added the crispy texture the dish was lacking. Balsamic Pork Ribs - One of the best ribs I've ever eaten.  The meat fell cleanly off the bone and was so tender and juicy. The balsamic sauce was rich, tangy, and sweet.  The cucumber and tomato salad on the side lent a bit of acidity to the meat which balanced the dish quite well.  I was licking my finger tips and gnawing on the bone after all the meat was gone - it was that good. Foie Gras Biscuits and Maple Sausage Gravy - I love foie gras.  When it is outlawed, I will weep into my pillow at night, but until then, I'll gorge myself on fatted goose liver until I land into a coma on a hospital bed.  This foie gras was one of the best I've had - second to Alexander's roasted foie gras.  The liver had pockets of fragrant fat which spilled into the creamy white gravy.  The gravy had a hint of sweetness from the maple and a little spicy/saltiness from the pork sausage.  The biscuit was buttery and flaky and mirrored the fatty foie gras perfectly.  This dish was pure decadence and nearly sent me over the edge.  I wanted to die, I was so happy!!! Flat Iron Steak - Finally, the last dish!  At this point I was about to burst.  Anything compared to the foie gras biscuits and gravy is almost a dud.  The meat(medium rare) was cooked perfectly but the truffle cream sauce was almost too much and overpowering.  The sunchoke hash was absolutely delicious and since I love hash, I could eat that all day! But compared to all the other amazing dishes we had, this one was good but not great.  I probably wouldn't order this dish the next time I go here (which will be tomorrow!) but this is still a solid dish on its own. When I come here again, I will make sure to save room for dessert!!!

i can't believe i haven't written a review for this! i thought i did...dang it! i brought one of my good friend here for his birthday last october. you definitely have to make reservations a week in advance. no joke. this place got so packed on a tuesday night! i heard the portions were small so i wanted to try EVERYTHING, but couldn't...haha. we got the pig ears, rabbit tenderloin rolls, foie gras loco moco, and bone marrow. honestly, i don't think americans would eat this, but asians eat all types of weird things often. animal definitely makes their dishes taste in a way where there's no way you can't eat it! haha, if that makes sense. the way they cook it, you can't even feel the actual texture...for example the pig ears are usually chewy, but they deep fried it or something and marinated in lemon. i wouldn't eat it if i could feel the texture, but i practically finished the whole plate bc it was so good! the rabbit tenderloin was okay, only bc i kept thinking about it, but it tastes like chicken. haha. even my friend was saying he wouldn't eat bone marrow, but they had a garlic paste or something on it, which was really good. i haven't had the chance to come back, but i'm DEFINITELY going back to try all the other different dishes. between two people you can order at least 4-5 dishes...try a bit of everything. my meal was right under $100, even with dessert! you won't go wrong if you come here...PROMISE! but you gotta be open minded haha.

I very luckily had the opportunity to dine at Animal recently. This place came highly recommended and we were all excited to try it out. We ordered: -chicken liver toast (3): Yelp did not let us down. This dish was amazing and the jam/marmalade/caramelized onions (my best guess) were a great complement to the liver. Now I really love liver, so if the taste of liver isn't for you, this might not be the best dish, but I would still recommend it due to the uniqueness of the flavor. If you love liver like me, then this dish is positively mind-blowing. It's also a pretty good deal, at $3 for a fairly large piece. -marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions (10): wasn't impressed. I mean, it was good, but nothing special. This was my first time ordering marrow at a restaurant; my prior experience with marrow has been when my mother used to give me the bones from her Chinese soups when I was a child and tell me to suck out the marrow for its nutrition, which, I can safely say, was way tastier than the marrow at Animal. -thai bbq quail, scallion, citrus, cashew, yogurt (19): I wasn't very impressed with this dish either. The flavor was interesting, although it didn't seem much like Thai BBQ. However, the portions of this dish were absolutely tiny, and it was also too salty. There is no way these three tiny pieces of quail were worth $20. -foie gras terrine, pickled cherry, black pepper (20): I really like foie gras so I had to order this as my entree. They were unfortunately out of the hot foie gras so I settled for the terrine. It was good, as foie gras always is, but nothing special. I've had better foie gras elsewhere...  although for foie gras, it was competitively priced. -flat iron, artichoke hash, truffle parmesan fondue (28): This was pretty tasty. However, again, the portions were ridiculously small. Two of my friends ordered this dish and one of them complained that it was overcooked. The truffle parmesan fondue was good but the truffle flavor was very faint. I think better steak can be gotten at other places for the same price, i.e. Mastro's. -bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream (7): I really liked the salt & pepper ice cream, although again, the portions were almost miniscule. I also enjoyed the saltiness of the bacon; the bacon:chocolate proportion here is greater than it is at other places, which I liked. However, I don't know if I could say that it's better than Vosges' bacon chocolate. It was good, but I don't think it deserved its place on the Best Thing I Ever Ate. -sticky toffee pudding, mascarpone, orange (7): pretty good but nothing mind-blowing. The bacon chocolate crunch bar had more of a unique taste. I also saw a lot of people order the tres leches so I'd be curious to try that the next time I come. The portions just seemed way too small to justify the price. None of us left satisfied and my friend even decided to grab a croissant from Canter's afterward. Still, the flavors were innovative and enjoyable and I'd be interested to sample some of their other dishes.   Service was decent. I enjoyed the trendy-minimalist ambiance. There's no sign outside and the place can be difficult to find, so make sure to go by the numbers. It's also right next to Canter's. Valet or free metered parking at night--although street parking was still somewhat crowded on a Friday around 10 pm. I'd come back again, but I wouldn't come hungry!

came here for an anniversary dinner with the bf, and had a great time! prices are reasonable for the amount, and the house wine priced at $20/bottle was a steal. of course we still ate our butts off, splitting 6 dishes, but really enjoyed everything that we had. only tip i'd have is DO NOT VALET! the poor valets are overworked and running around like crazy, and it still took us 20 minutes to get our car. just park in the $5 lot around the corner with no muss no fuss. highlights: - chicken liver mousse on toasted bread: deliciously creamy with just a hint of liver - foie gras biscuit with maple sausage: decadent and delicious - kale: so refreshing, who knew kale could be so yummy - tres leches cake: moist and kept well for the next day decent: - pork ears: loved the citrusy stirfry feel, altho i was already quite full by the time we added this on - oxtail fries: to me, they were just okay. i really liked the cheesy bites though.

Wow. Orgasim in my mouth indeed.  Not sure if it's because of all of the other 1037 Yelpers who have given this place an overall 4.5 rating, but I LOVED everything about Animal. The location, the design, the people, and most importantly THE FOOD! Went in on a Thursday night and found some street parking about a block away and made it right on time for our 6:45 reservation. (Reservation needed) It's a small place, and they could probably accomadate a large party, but I wouldn't recommend it. Animal definitely fits the hipster trendy style amongst the streetwear boutiques on Fairfax, neighbors to The Hundreds on Rosewood, Diamond, and Supreme. (Passed by Ben Baller on his cell phone as we were walking to the restaurant.) There is no obvious restaurant sign so it could easily be missed, but spotting the valet booth is easy. The food came out quickly, the server (and some others) would always come by between each plate to see how we liked it, and our water glasses were always filled. The waiter had suggested 3-4 dishes for 2 people, but we ordered 6 + 1 more for dessert. What I love is that each plate is just enough for a few bites - a little taste. And a little taste is really all you need because each bite is like an orgasim of flavor and texture in your mouth. WOW! Of the 6, top 3 were the Bone Marrow, Foie Gras with Biscuit+Gravy, and the BBQ Pork Belly Sandwiches. The other three were the Soft Egg Texas Cavier Bentons Bacon Buttermilk Yogurt,  Hamachi Tostada, and Melted Petit Basque Chorizo Grilled Bread. And for dessert the Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar S&P Ice Cream which was a little too salty for my taste for dessert. Worth every penny. Must try this place. MUST. MUST. MUST. I will be back to try to brains, ears, and tail.

this place is DELICIOUS. I licked my plate clean for every dish and still write home about coming here again when I am in the area. Every dish was packed with flavor and pretty much every taste bud in my mouth was satisfied. If you ever are wondering where to go on a nice date with your partner, check this place out!

Mega Orgasmic. That is how I would rate this incredible restaurant. The pork belly sliders are a must- they melt in your mouth and make you want to touch yourself. The chicken liver toast is so incredible you might just be going to heaven. The flat iron steak with truffle fondue is simply an experience worth coming back for. The pork short ribs are good too but expect them to be very saucy. As a whole, I spent my entire diner closing my eyes and having a mega food orgasm. The service is great and the music choice makes it super chill. Go and enjoy yourself - if you're willing to try new tastes, you surely won't regret it.

Great food and service. Expensive though. Problem is it's TOO DAMN LOUD. Can't even hear the person next to you speak,..... But to get to the good part....the food! The food here makes your taste buds go wild. You taste things you didn't know existed. My favorite was the Chicken Liver toast. it's the cheapest thing...and it's small.... but it's freaking Delish! I had 3 of them. The one thing that I did not particularly enjoy was the Pig Ear...it was too much for me... When combined with the egg..it was enjoyable..but without the egg it wasn't bearably. THey only put 1 egg but I feel like they should have put 2... Their marrow bone was good, but nothing crazy. I love Marrow so I enjoyed it. Rabbit leg was good...but I don't think I can eat rabbit again...they're too cute.. the Halibut was to die for...melts perfectly in your mouth The Fole Gras...reminded me of breakfast...a very very expensive breakfast...like when you put butter on bread with jelly...it tasted great, but tasted just like what I can do at home... The deserts.... don't get me started lol. The cake was amazing The recommendations seem to be the Bacon bar..but it wasn't my personal fav, it was a bit too hard Will I be back? Not sure... this place is a must try for sure...but as a repeat? That's debatable.... I know of other places I would rather spend my $ on. Parking is street and it's a pain O and there is NO SIGN in front of it...just the number and it's hellll small. You can barely see it. Their root beer was really good:)

A no-tablecloth place that puts amazing food at the forefront.  I've visited thrice now, have been thoroughly satisfied each time, and I'm sure you will be too.  Everything on the menu will be very good, if not mindblowingly great. Biggest recommendation? Get the Tres Leches dessert.   Oh, and with the state-wide ban on foie gras coming up, get your fill while these masters can legally serve it. Service is fast-paced but they are always on top of their game.  I drink like a fish and my water glass was never empty.  Finished dishes were promptly removed, and we hardly had to wait for our next dish (kudos to the kitchen staff for the timing, also). Can be a bit noisy and energetic inside, so come prepared.

Ah, LA...how you love being trendy. And this place is certainly that. It's funny, I've experienced the exact same vibe here that I have at many high-end restaurants in Napa valley. The main difference is the quality of the food. Seriously, I loved the foie gras biscuits n' gravy, and the bacon chocolate dessert was interesting, but nothing else jumped out at me as incredible. The prices weren't too bad but the dishes were fairly small. I really don't understand why the place is so packed all the time. chicken liver toast - nothing special, very liver-y tasting..needed some seasoned salt perhaps? marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions - tasty, but greasy melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread - burnt and extremely greasy, probably the least favorite at the table pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg - this was excellent, though the textures were weird. The crunchiness of the ears and gooeyness of the egg were hard to get over but the flavor was excellent. poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - my first experience with poutine and I'm not sure how similar it is to the originating dish. It tasted like beef stew on fries. Wasn't a fan. foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - LOVED THIS. Sinful and awesome. crispy rabbit legs, meyer lemon aioli, green beans - the aioli tasted like tartar sauce and didn't go with the breading at all. The rabbit was cooked well but I scraped off most of the sauce. sticky toffee pudding, mascarpone, orange - too sweet and tasted more like bread? bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream - really tasty but very small Overall - no real strong desire to go back.

Underwhelmed.  I really wanted to love this place but I was quite disappointed. Among three people, we ordered: Chicken Liver Toast:  I love liver and this was no exception.  It was a great start to our meal. Marrow Bone:  The marrow was rather tasteless.  Even Father's Office's is better.  However, I have to credit them for the softness.  At least they cooked it well. Foie Gras Loco Moco:  A great disappointment.  The foie gras was completely overtaken by the spam and burger meat.  We got such a small sliver of foie gras that it would've been better if it was left out completely.  At least I wouldn't have such high expectations.  The sauce that accompanied the meat was like sweet soy sauce and sriracha.  Not what I expected. BBQ Pork Sliders:  One of my favorite dishes.  I normally don't like BBQ, pork, or cole slaw.  But these sliders were delish!  The buns were like croissants but with a stronger texture.  And the meat was soft and so flavorful.  This is a must try. Crispy Rabbit Legs:  I have had rabbit meat before and until now, I've always had a good experience.  The rabbit legs were dry and tasted like chicken.  The only thing giving it flavor was the sauce. Grilled Quail:  This was another one of my favs.  The quail was grilled and marinated to perfection.   Though the dishes are tapas-style, they were not timed very well.  Dishes were served every 10-15 minutes so we sat there often with nothing to do but talk.   I do however commend them for the variety they're able to offer.  Since there are a lot of people who love this place, I would recommend to try it for your own experience.

Nice, cozy restaurant.  Best party size to eat here is 4 people.  The dishes are meant to be shared family style, so splitting the portions into 4 gives a nice bite of each dish....and you'll get to order/try more this way.  We ordered the following (pics available for each): Chicken liver toast $3 (4 stars): Chilled "pate" spread on a crisp toast with sweet caramelized onions.  Delicious & simple. Marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions $10 (3 stars): OK dish; texture of the marrow was firmer than most places I've tried (I like it softer) & the chimichurri sauce also gives a slight tangy taste...whereas I like the natural sweetness of marrow.  Served with buttered toast. Pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg $12 (4 stars): I really liked this dish..would have liked it better if it had a bit less lime juice (made it sour!).  The pig ear is crispy and goes well with the egg & yolk (once you break it).  Despite the sour taste...i still liked it & would order it again.   BBQ Pork belly sandwiches, slaw $12 (4 stars): Yum!  Slider with tender/rich, fatty goodness drenched in bbq sauce w/ coleslaw.  Each bite melts in your mouth... Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar $16 (3 stars): Ok dish; reminded me of a glamorized version of chili-cheese fries. Very filling due to the amount of fries.  Lots of oxtail w/ melted cheese as the topping, yet the fries were still crisp & crunchy which is amazing. Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy $24 (3 stars): Only OK...and I usually love foie gras.  I thought the biscuit was too "heavy"...it soaked up all the butter & foie gras fat/gravy it was sitting in & the maple syrup overpowered the whole dish. It was a bit sweet for my taste. I ended up eating the foie gras by itself..and left the heavy biscuit sitting in the heavy butter sauce/gravy. Flat iron, artichoke hash, truffle parmesan fondue $28 (4.5 stars): The fave dish of our group. Nice, seared juicy steak with a creamy, cheesy sauce on top. Complemented well with the artichoke & baby potatoes Foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger $35 (4 stars): Filling dish...just like it says above: foie gras on top of spam, on top of burger meat, on top of rice with a slightly sweet Hawaiian sauce.  The burger was more well-done than I prefer but the dish was good overall. Bacon chocolate crunch bar $7 (4.5 stars): It's not a chocolate covered bacon strip but a soft, rich, dark-chocolate fudgebar with a creamier chocolate "icing" with a generous amount of crunchy bacon bits in the "icing."  It's an interesting & tasty mix.

If you have any... and I mean ANY problem (ethical or otherwise) feasting on meat, please do not come within a square mile of this place.  I feel like there should be an alarm that goes off when a vegetarian (or God forbid a vegan) enters the door.   Still here? good. we can be friends. Hipster chefs Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo of Iron Chef fame have created a menu of small plates that combine the decadence of American comfort food with the precision and inventiveness of an upscale, experimental kitchen.  What you end up with are delightful small plates that punch you in the face with flavor.   The menu items that everyone on Yelp raves about are obviously awesome...but don't be afraid to stray from your comfort zone.  I never thought I'd be eating veal brains and pig ears either, but here we are... The servers are excellent and I highly recommend letting them guide you through your meal. The hostesses are fine... one time they gave me lip for showing up a few minutes early for our reservation.  Wasn't too thrilled about that.   Only beer and wine, which sucks.  But you'll live.  Have a beer and eat like a man.

My hubby brought me here for our anniversary recently and i must admit i was thoroughly  impressed. Its design is minimal, which lets you concentrate on the company and yummy food. Dress attire is cool and casual. da nitty gritty Chicken liver toast: 3$ -four slices of toasts support a nice slice of chicken liver with a sweet, tangy sauce...definitely get this again, esp since it's so cheap barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw 12$-two mini burgers with just the right amount of fatty pork and bbq sauce. THEse guys really melt in your mouth. This was my hubby's FAVORITE by far. hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut 14$ This was my least favorite dish. You can taste the hamachi, but it was a bit too spicy. Spice lovers will go nuts over it. foie gras terrine, boysenberry jam, rose geranium gastrique 20$ This one had AMAZING flavor..not sure if it was the jam or rose gastrique, but holy moly this was the bomb. Please share this cuz i ate the whole dish myself and it was a bit too filling. The foie gras slices were rather large. Not complaining though... foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger 35$ I think this was my favorite. The fois gras melted so effortlessly in my mouth and whatta surprise to find a thin slice of spam. The cous cous drenched in gravy was just the perfect match. tres leches, dulce de leche 7$ Not my thing really, but my hubby loved it. I did take a bite and i must admit it was good but i never really understood why someone would want to eat a wet cake??!!!! bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream 7$ Interesting dish...wouldn't order it again, but at least i can say i tried it. All in all, I would definitely come back and try their other unique dishes. I really loved how their tapas were small enough to not consume you yet large enough for you to get a filling taste of it. Most noteworthy are how the flavors just seem to blend so well leaving you feel like you had a mini orgasm after each dish. yap...good for wedding anniversary dinner alright!

A Carniwhore's and Offal Lover's Dream... If celebrity chefs Chris Cosentino (Incanto's "Offal God") and Roy Yamaguchi (Roy's) came together to open a restaurant, Animal would be it. Adventurous offal cuisine with a Hawaiian-fusion flair. Genius chefs Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo use an innovative combination of ingredients and flawlessly execute each dish with explosive flavors. It was hands-down one of my most memorable and favorite meals of my life! My friends and I came to Animal for dinner on Friday, 12.2.11 at 6 PM. I have to note that the hostess had called me 3 hours prior to confirm our reservations for the wrong day. She was very curt over the phone and said I would have to talk to the manager if we wanted to eat dinner that night since they were fully booked. She offered us bar seats (first come, first serve basis) instead which we reluctantly agreed on. However, when we arrived at 6 PM, she said was able to get us a table. Her demeanor over the phone was just as bad in person but I wasn't going to let her bad attitude (i.e. brusque interactions and eye rolling) ruin our dinner. F O O D From start to finish, each dish was FOODGASMIC impeccably executed and packed with bold flavors. *CHICKEN LIVER TOAST w/ Balsamic Caramelized Onions ($3) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The toasted crusty bread was generously slathered with rich and velvety pate. The texture was so delicate that it was almost mousse-like. The vertical sprinkling of the balsamic caramelized onions gave a nice sweet acidic bite. *BONE MARROW w/ Chimichurri & Garlic Toasts ($10) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Every time that I see bone marrow on the menu, I always order it and this was by far the best I've ever had. The halved bone marrow was perfectly cooked which was exhibited in the copious amounts of rich beefy globular chunks (when overcooked, the marrow liquefies). The chimichurri was herbaceous and had just enough acidity to cut through all the richness from the marrow. *FOIE GRAS LOCO MOCO w/ Quail Egg, Spam & Hamburger ($35) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… THE BEST THING I EVER ATE. PERIOD.  Atop a bed of Vietnamese broken rice (com tam) was a pyramid of meats, a grilled hamburger patty, pan fried spam and seared foie gras which was topped with an sunny side up quail egg. Each bite was toe tingling and mind-blowing.  The trio of meats combined created an intense meaty flavor. From the tender beefy hamburger patty, the salty and smoky spam, to the luxuriously rich foie gras, it set off rounds of carnivorous fireworks in my mouth.  The "gravy" was had a delectable sweet and savoryness which perfectly complemented the nutty broken rice and the dish as a whole. Dollops of sriracha added a pop of spice. Breaking the yolk caused a lava flow which added a layer of creamy decadence taking the dish off the charts! *BACON CHOCOLATECRUNCH BAR w/ S&P Ice Cream ($7) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Featured on the Food Network's "The Best Thing I Ever Ate", this savory sweet dessert didn't disappoint. I've had bacon chocolate gelato, bacon chocolate brittle, and chocolate covered bacon and was never a fan of the combination until now. Between two layers of Nutella was a thick and silky layer of ganache. The bits of crispy bacon imparted a crisp, rich smokiness without being overwhelming. The creamy s&p ice cream added a nice temperature and texture contrast. S E R V I C E Aside from the rude hostess, the staff at Animal was AWESOME! Our two waiters were very nice, down to earth, and attentive. All our dishes were well-spaced and timed. The bus boys never left our water glasses empty and quickly took away our finished plates. A M B I A N C E / D É C O R Minimalist décor; bare ivory walls, rustic wooden furnishings, wine bar and dim lighting. There's 8 seats at the bar (first come, first serve basis) and about a 45 seat dining room. A perfect place to bring an adventurous foodie for a date. P A R K I N G Street parking. Valet parking is available which was unnecessary considering parking was fairly easy to find before 6 PM. Animal is the quintessential restaurant for offal lovers and carniwhore foodies alike. FIVE RAWRS ALL THE WAY!

Always an extraordinary experience every time I'm here! There is definitely no shortage of the new hip-n-trendy, innovative cooking styles, and celeb chefs owned establishments in the City of Angels. However, not all of them can live up the hype. By that I mean, creative dishes might look and sound good, but they don't always taste good. I like Animal for that reason, the food is different, it plays with your imagination, but at the same time it pleases the palates. Quick Tip #1 - The restaurant has a small store front with NO SIGN on the exterior. So look for the valet stand. 5 stars dishes - Foie gras with biscut and gravy, Hamachi tostada, Asparagus with fried egg, Foie gras loco moco, Rabbit sausage, and oxtail poutine. 4 stars dishes - Pork Belly sliders, bone marrows, and Beet Salad. 3 stars dishes (aka Bleh dishes) - Balsamic Pork Ribs, Fried sweetbread, Pig Ears, and Grilled Octopus. Quick Tip #2 - Must order -  House Cabernet at $20 a bottle! Great wine, tasted better than the other $70/bottle red on the menu. Service was wonderful. During my last visit, we brought our own cupcakes and cupcake stand for a birthday celebration. Our waiter couldn't be more accommodating and knowledgeable as well. Final Tip - You will have a great dinner if you're open minded about trying the unusual (for example, rabbit sausage might sound a little weird for some). Animal is literally a dream come true for LA food lovers and for those who craves actual dining experiences and not just a meal (me!). I look forward to visit again when they have new dishes!

BLOWN AWAY. That's how I felt after my meal at Animal. I had been wanting to eat here for ages and when my boyfriend decided on having his birthday dinner here, I could not have been happier. Every aspect of our dining experience was AMAZING. Like everyone says, the food is top-notch, but so is the service & the casual, laid-back environment. When my boyfriend & I placed our order, our server repeated it and then told us exactly what order they would bring each course in. He hit the nail on the head because the progression of our meal was spot on. -Chicken Liver Toast: We loved the creamy texture and the caramelized onion jam on top. A great starter to our meal (esp. at $3!) -Hamachi Tostada with Herbs, Fish sauce vinaigrette & Peanuts: I absolutely loved this dish!! The combination of Thai/Mexican/Vietnamese flavors were all familiar, yet new. The Hamachi itself was great quality. -Bone Marrow with Chimichurri Sauce and Caramelized Onions: WOW! The fluffy, buttery brioche bread was just PERFECT for spreading the marrow on. In my opinion, the Chimichurri wasn't overpowering and was a great complement to the dish. I felt like a glutton savoring each marrow-y bite haha -Foie Gras with Biscuit and Maple Sausage Gravy: Just when we thought the Marrow was incredible, this dish slaps us in the face. So sinfully rich...this dish was the highlight of our meal. It was sweet, creamy and surprisingly, not too heavy. -Crispy Pig's Head with Pickled Vegetables and Aioli: This dish was just okay. The meat from the pig's head was scraped out and was fried in panko. I liked the different textures but overall, this was our least favorite of the evening. -Melted Petit Basque with Chorizo & Grilled Bread: Delicious, it was their own spin on a Mexican Queso Fundido dish. I loved the warm, gooey cheese, but the dish ended up being a bit greasy and heavy towards the end. I also got the House Cab and my boyfriend got the Mint Tea...both great complements to our meal ;) After our meal here, I can honestly say that Animal is now one of my favorite restaurants. 2 weeks later, and I'm still thinking about the Bone Marrow and Foie Gras! Now, the question is: Do I come back for a repeat visit or try the equally revered Son Of A Gun? Hmmmm... **Some quick tips: -Make reservations! -Valet parking is $5.50 -Awesome music selection! I loved how they were bumping old-school Dr. Dre and Beastie Boys -This 'signless' restaurant is located right next to Supreme :)

My first 5 star rating in a long time.  Seriously... seriously. I think LA has a lot of 'good' restaurants but 'great' restaurants are just so rare.  I walked into Animal without any expectations but was greeted and treated extremely well by the staff.  The menu seemed interesting and I ordered a few popular dishes to see what the hype was all about. lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac:  I hate salads.  This salad was good...flavorful and the texture perfect. barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw:  So yea, holy crap.  It was a flavor punch to your face and it was so juicy, i washed my face in it. hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut:  First the flavor is... salad/vinaigrette, then the herbs and fish kick in.....the peanut slaps you after.  Loved this dish foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger:  Had to try this dish.  It is everything I've ever wanted in a dish.  Its a dish a hawaiian samoan french chef would make you at the ABC store.  so delicious.   bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream:  So i've made bacon chocolate at home and I've tried it at other places.  Congrats... Animal wins.  The best dessert I've had in a long time.  The chocolate is rich, thick and awesome.  The bacon adds the crunch...and the bacon.  The ice cream is balances everything out... amazing. Food + Service + Value +. Verdict: This place rocks. 2 for $100 or less is EASY if you don't drink or eat foie gras.  The food is fantastic...a rare new american restaurant that serves unique dishes.

Word on the street is, this restaurant serves up some excellent tasting animal costing a small fortune for each bite. I'm cheap. I love Hometown Buffet and crab legs at a $10 Chinese buffet dinner. When I'm asked to fork over a cost of 3 night's dinner for a small plate of food, I clutch my wallet a little tighter and narrow my eyes. I finally got over it after reminding myself that I have a job and I am no longer a student living off ramen. It's really hard to let go especially after harboring that kind of lifestyle for so long. To hell with it. I'm going to eat whatever the heck I want and whether I feel sorry for it or not, I can deal with it later. Spoiler alert: I was not sorry. Since I had never been here, I let my friend who had prior experience take the reins and order what he deemed appropriate for the evening. We started with a carafe of their house chardonnay. It was about half the price of all the other carafes listed on their wine menu, but the flavor of the wine was still fruity, tangy, and fresh. It was the flavor of happy. First up to the plate was bbq pork belly sandwich with slaw. The roll looked orange, shiny and toasted and because I've eaten so many sliders with the bread drying out prematurely, I was expecting to bite into something semi-crunchy and difficult to eat. So imagine my surprise when I picked it up, the fluff of the bread immediately succumbed to the pressure of my fingers and it felt like a cloud. It was delicious, equal amounts tender, sweet, tangy, with just enough bread to soften the palate overload. Second up was the balsamic pork ribs with tomato & cucumber panzanella. My friend told me, "Watch this." and proceeded to pick up the rib with his left hand, took the fork in his right, and guided the fork down the side of the rib. I sat in awe just watching the meat slide right off the bone. Amazing. The meat melted in my mouth along with the excellent balsamic glaze and the tomato & cucumber panzanella provided a great balance. I loved seeing the pile of bare bones on my plate. Third was flat iron steak with sunchoke hash, truffle parmesan fondue. Holy hell. Are you sure this piece of meat comes from the cow's shoulder? The softness of the medium-rare steak really threw me off. How the cooks got the meat to maintain tenderness and what quality of meat they are using are intriguing because I want to recreate this in my kitchen! The fondue was a dream, a blanket of comfort on a soft pad of meat. By the time dessert came around, I was stuffed and my tastebuds were recovering from a drunken stupor. The sticky toffee pudding with mascarpone and orange zest was the proper culmination after a round of deliciousness. The little blocks of bittersweet coupled with drizzled sticky toffee and mascarpone weren't too sweet and the orange zest gave each bite life. I have to admit I've had better dessert elsewhere, but the characteristic minimalist presentation coupled with subtle flavors made it a great complement to everything we ate that night. I will definitely be back in the future. When I say animal is tasty, I'm not meaning to be unsophisticated or lacking in speech skills. I'm talking about that restaurant on Fairfax.

I'm full. I feel weighted down and oversalted by the meal. We ordered 13 items on the menu between the five of us. To top it off we also ordered each dessert. Yes, we are a bunch of pigs. Despite the way I feel, I've got to say it was a great meal. Cant knock the restaurant down for us over ordering! Chicken Liver Toast: $3?! great start to the meal! Baby Kale: Ok Grilled broccoli and smoked trout: surprisingly good Tandoori Octopus: excellent! BBQ pork belly sandwhich: not as heavy as one would think... really tasty Shrimp and rabbit sausage spring roll: not sure what all the hype is about Hamachi Tostada: also not sure what all the hype is about Poutine with oxtail gravy: too salty Foie Grois Biscuit: unbelievably good, wanted to order another Bone Marrow: as good as it gets: Flat Iron: delicious. I'm surprised it came out overcooked but the flavors were excellent Rabbit Legs: didn't try it. Something about eating a rabbit leg doesn't sit well with me. But the other people in our enjoyed it Foie Gras Loco Mono: salty! Probably least enjoyable dish of the night. BTW: house wine was only $20 per bottle and surprisingly not bad. Very light for a cabernet though.

Warning: this will be a long post... Animal is definitely at the top of my favorite restaurants list! I first heard of it from the Yelp blog article about the top ten restaurants of 2011, and later confirmed its popularity when my sister said it was a great place. My friend and I made reservations a few weeks in advanced and ate there last Friday night. For those who plan on going, note that it's a small black square store right next to the white Supreme store. There's no sign with the restaurant name and it can be easy to miss due to its hidden nature (it's right behind the traffic light post where the crosswalk is). We showed up about 30 minutes early but were seated within 5-10 minutes later. It was decently crowded and dim-lighted with an interestingly plain design and layout. Our two servers were extremely friendly (Victor was such a sweetheart!) and helpful and gave us tips on what to order and when to. We started off with the Baby Kale (pecorino, lemon chili vinaigrette, breadcrumbs) which was AMAZING. I recently became a fan of kale, and in this salad it was so finely chopped I couldn't even recognize it. The vinaigrette is pretty tangy and sour (which my friend didn't like so much) and was a tad too salty, but I loved it. The breadcrumbs add a nice contrast to the texture too. We next ordered two Bone Marrows (chimichurri, caramelized onions) that were generous portions. Each one came with a large/thick piece of toast sliced into triangles. It was a delicious dish, but I wasn't a big fan at how thick/goupy the bone marrow was. The chimichurri sauce really made it pop though, and added an even more savory taste to each bite. For our main course, I ordered the Flat Iron (sunchoke hash, truffle parmesan fondue) and he ordered the Foie Gras Loco Moco (quail egg, spam, hamburger). I have to say my steak is what won me over. I love, love, love truffle, so the parmesan glaze was a phenomenal pairing. The steak was cooked to perfection, medium rare, and practically melted in my mouth. I tried a bit of the loco moco and have to say I was not impressed. Considering its hype on Yelp I thought it would be the dish to top the rest, but it seemed like a cheap asian dish (eggs, rice and hamburger meat..? o_O) with foie gras slapped on to make it fancy. Finally, for dessert we tried the Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar (s&p ice cream) since it was also a popular listing on Animal's Yelp page. I have to admit, for someone who doesn't like bacon, I enjoyed the dessert. I'd probably still pick a salted caramel ice cream over this, but I'm glad I tried it! Animal is definitely a must try to everyone. Delicious food, great service, and a classy environment perfect for friends, family or a date :)

This place is spectacular! It's like a hidden gem of its location... A reservation is a must! The service is amazing. They talk to you like long lost friends that haven't seen each other in a while! They are extremely attentive and they give great advice on what selections are the best. The food was phenomenal... We tried the hamachi tostada with edible flowers and the jalapenos, foie gras over biscuit & maple sausage gravy, poutine with oxtail gravy & cheddar, rabbit loin spring rolls, veal tongue with smoked foie gras & pastrami spices, and for a wonderful ending we ordered the bacon chocolate crunch bar with salt & pepper ice cream!!! Honestly, every single bite was amazing. I think I had so many orgasms I lost count. LoL This is a wonderful place I would come over and over again. Simply perfect! ^_^

Great food, but change your management.  Their GM doesn't understand the meaning of guest first.  Nor does she understand how to correct a problem without making you feel like an idiot.  Fake, insincere and probably learned hospitality in a book. Sorry GM (starts with A)  if this is harsh, but u made a big impression.

Full review in the blog - highlight dishes below: Leaving the Chef's at liberty to send out the dishes in whatever order they deemed best I was a bit surprised when my first course arrived twenty or so minutes after ordering as it was certainly the heaviest dish and actually the one I expected last, the famous Foie Gras, Biscuit, Maple Sausage Gravy.  Certainly not subtle or dainty in flavor or portion this dish was actually one of the reasons I came to Animal and considering the ample praise it has received over time the dish really did turn out to be a stunner; the Foie Gras itself seared flawlessly with a caramelized exterior and butter soft center juxtaposed against the pillowy buttermilk biscuit and all soaked in thick smoky gravy with just a hint of syrup.  Sweet but not too sweet, large but not too large, and all-in-all quite like biscuits and gravy anywhere else with the foie gras as a lovely bonus justifying the cult status and price tag. For the second course of the night I opted for one that I was told was "something new the chef's have been working on" in the form of Coconut Sweetbreads, Raita, Mango, Tamarind and with the influence clearly coming from Indian cuisine I really liked what this dish had to offer.  Beginning first with the sweetbreads, a large gland cut into nine bite-sized pieces and fried golden with a sweet exterior giving way to the expected creamy tones within the crunchy bites were then paired with sliced and cooked cucumbers and mangos providing a nice vegetal interplay while the use of cumin scented yogurt added a touch of sour.  Already delicious a final topping with edible flowers and a smear of rich tamarind reduction added yet another layer to the dish further impressing me by making a generally dense ingredient seem quite light. Another signature dish that has been on Animal's menu since day one, "Pig Ear, Chili, Lime, Fried Egg" would prove to be a nice follow-up to the hefty liver and dense sweetbreads and packing quite a punch in the spice department I also understood why the kitchen opted to send it later in the meal.  Light and tasty despite the pork and egg constituents this dish felt a lot like breakfast with the crispy ears quite like well done bacon and the creamy egg doing a nice job to help mellow the spice.  A great balance, particularly with the mild citrus tones this reminded me a lot of Chicago's Purple Pig though I still think the one in the Windy City remains the best porcine ear dish I've yet encountered. Pig's Tails Buffalo Style, Celery, Ranch was probably the least successful dish of the night for me, this plate arrived precisely as billed with the fatty tails nicely cooked and falling off the bone while paired with celery leaves, radish, a bit of carrot, and plenty of hot sauce.  Using the ranch as a bit of a balance but still quite hot from all the cayenne I must say I did enjoy the texture of this dish, but overall I just found the taste a bit too one dimensional - especially after the complexities of those prior. My final savory of the evening was Melted Petit Basque, Chorizo, and Grilled Bread - a simply delightful porcelain dish of the mildly-pungent sheep's milk cheese still bubbling hot and layered atop crisp and savory chorizo.  Still in its molten state on arrival and paired with crunchy bread lightly brushed with oil this course was nearly a spoonable fondue with each bite full of savory notes and a touch of spice over the cheese's unmistakable nutty tones; a perfect cheese course before dessert. Dessert 1 would be "Sticky Toffee Pudding, Mascarpone, Orange," a dense steamed pudding in the traditional fashion with plenty of dates and butter plus ample notes of brown sugar and cinnamon within.  Small but intense and topped with a sort of orange marmalade infused toffee adding a citrus tone to the otherwise buttery and creamy sauce I particularly enjoyed the use of mascarpone as a base not only for the light cloudy texture, but also for helping to balance the overall sweetness. For my final dish of the evening, and my final bites of Los Angeles for 2011 actually, Animal's famous "Bacon Chocolate Bar, S&P Ice Cream" would arrive along with my third mug of coffee and every bit as decadent as one would figure it to be given its ingredients this dish did not fail to impress.  Reportedly inspired by the Kit-Kat, much like Michel Richard's signature dessert, this triple layer slice consisted first of a layer of thick ganache sprinkled with and infuse with bacon resting atop a layer of dark chocolate riddled with nuts and finally a crunchy chocolate cookie base.  With a dehydrated milk powder decorating one half of the plate and a ball of creamy salt and pepper ice cream balancing the other I really enjoyed the various flavors, textures, and contrasts of this dessert but in the end it was the quality and nuance of the chocolate that stole the show even if the bacon gets all the headlines.

Not sure what more I can add here.  Loved the food.   The wine list is terrific and the sommelier is great.  You know she knows what she is doing when they have Keller trocken and Baudry les Granges by the glass. Small nits 1) I'm not sure that rabbit legs can stand up to being deep fried.  Rabbit is delicate and is best simply grilled.  I'd use duck or maybe squab. 2) The sweetbreads (made popcorn style) tasted like fried something and not like sweetbreads which I've always viewed as poor man's fois gras. Must visit LA foodie restaurant.

SO DISAPPOINTED!  SO SO SO VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!  Sorry yelpers.  I'm really trying my best to see why 800+ people found this place "SO SO GOOD"   One reviewer said it best "They're a bit pretentious". To be more accurate, this is as pretentious as it gets in LA's "dining scene" Before i get crucified here let me tell you why: 1) Hamachi tostada:  Are you kidding?  Vietnamese slaw with a few slivers of what is suppose to be hamachi on a deep fried corn tortilla?  seriously?   2) Bone marrow:  Um....chimichurri on the side please!  Too overpowering slathered on the marrow.  I know marrow is more texture then flavor but there IS flavor.  It was like I was eating chimichurri lard. 3) Pig tails: Over fried pieces of deep fried nuggets of what's suppose to be pig tails but really were just nuggets of fried oil!  And to drown that in buffalo sauce?   4) BBQ Pork Belly Sliders: finally, something that was fairly decent but $12 for 2 tiny sliders you can get at any reasonable bbq joint?  I came to Animal for a unique dining experience not for something I can get at lucille's down the street.   5) Grilled Baby Broccoli: Nice.  Egg-nice.  Pancetta - excellent touch 6) Fois Gras Biscuit - No comment.  *sigh*  Need I say more. 7) Veal Brains: first time trying it.  The curry  spices and apple sauce were not bad.  Classic combo, nothing new.   8) Sticky toffee pudding: not bad.  Fleur de sel on top was a nice touch  Would've preferred marscarpone ice cream instead of it just tracked on the plate. 9) Trec Leche: Its a $7 Tres Leche cake.  yeah, you heard right, $7 for a piece of "someone at the office had a birthday" cake.  Let's just put a pseudo offering basket at the front door so we can just give them our money. Service was not bad.  It's noisy though, like thats the new thing for LA restaurants now. Do I sound pissed?  Yeah I was pissed.  For the money we spent and the food we got it felt something like, getting my wallet stolen and knowing who stole it.  Know what I mean?  And why is it called Animal?  Just cuz they serve a few pig parts and brains?  Theres more offal than that.  Tripe?  Kidneys?  Blood sausages?  Liver?  A taco truck offers more "animal" than this place. I'm sorry guys.  I lost confidence in LA's dining scene awhile ago.  Everything just starts to taste the same.  I was really excited to try Animal from word of mouth and yelp.  Now I'm kicking myself for setting my expectations too high.  I thought maybe this place would change my opinion of LA's dining scene but it just solidified that LA's dining scene is just that:   "LA's dining scene"

Animal is a restaurant that deserves the category "for a special occasion." It's not that it's outrageously priced - it's possible to get out of there at $45 per person for a good amount of food and drinks; it's just that it's not a restaurant you can suddenly decide to go to, mostly due to the richness of its food, but also in part due to the difficulty of getting a reservation. But the food is worth the reservation. Where else will you get biscuits and gravy with perfectly caramelized lumps of foie gras? Where else will you find a poutine with first rate cheese and beautifully braised meat on top? Even when Animal goes light, it's right. The hamachi tostada is almost a vision of things to come at their new seafood restaurant, Son of a Gun. The beet salad with butermilk dressing and goat cheese is full of flavor, but the dressing is light enough to make it truly a salad, and not just a meat-centric restaurant's take on a salad. And the pig ear with fried egg is just the most beautiful, crispy, spicy and chewy small plate you'll get in town. So, when you feel like you can manage a rich dinner and you have the patience to wait for a reservation, go to Animal.

This place was just so simple yet so upscale. The name of the restaurant wasn't even displayed out front and their menus were on paper since it changes daily. They also had a very minimalist decor with simple tables and seats surrounded by bare, white walls and the ambience of the place was just perfect for a nice dinner date with the boyfriend. It was as if they created the perfect casual environment without trying too hard. Now their food was absolutely superb. We ordered 4 dishes since portions are a bit bigger than tapas but smaller than a regular meal and it seemed to be the perfect amount of food to share among the two of us. 1. foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy ($23): This was my absolute favorite dish. It was just so buttery and fatty with such a nice blend of flavors. And the biscuit was so fluffy and the perfect carb complement for the foie gras. Now the gravy was the star of this one. It was seriously the best gravy I've ever had in my life, with the perfect amount of sweetness to it. 2. marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions ($10): I loved that it was served in a bone and I really enjoyed the bold flavor of the chimichurri. But then the texture of it was just too out there for me. The boyfriend enjoyed it very much and said that the texture was the best part of this dish. I guess it's based on personal preference. 3. barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw ($12): I didn't like this as much as the foie gras but it was still quite scrumptious. The quality of the pork belly was absolutely top notch and the BBQ sauce was so subtle but yet somehow, it lingered. (How is that even possible?!) The best part of this dish was when you bit into a piece of pork fat, which was absolute heaven. 4. poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar ($15): Now these are some bourgeois fries. The meat was so tender and not heavily flavored so somehow, the fries were the star of this dish. It was crisp to perfection and perfectly salted. I don't know what else to say except that it was just amazing. I absolutely loved everything about this place and will definitely be back to try more of their exotic dishes like rabbit legs and veal brains!

Believe the hype.  Order only house wine.  Stay off the beaten path, because I think other places do standards (like the porkbelly sandwich) better.

chicken liver toast - YUM!  get your own.  i could eat 5 of these little yummy melt in your mouth smothered toasts.  and they're only 3 bucks each.  acidity from the caramelized onions (?) maybe in a red wine reduction (?) piled on top cut perfectly through the creamy fat of the generously spread liver mousse.   kale salad w/ pecorino and breadcrumbs - b/c you need some greens in this meal.  but it was a good salad.  pecorino and lemon vinaigrette gave it lots of savory. seared foie gras w/ biscuit and maple sausage gravy - a nice big piece seared foie gras.  biscuit was so-so.  gravy was really rich and flavorful.  good comfort food but a little too sweet for my taste. veal tongue - the football-shaped scoop of smoked foie gras gelato that accompanied the seared slices of little tongue was amazing!!!  tongue was ok.  was expecting more texture but was just really soft and tender, overly salty, and a tad oily...kinda like if you sliced spam up and fried it up on a pan.  maybe i don't really like veal, i don't know. bbq belly pork sandwiches - an order comes with 2 sliders.  not much to say about this one.  replace pulled pork with a cube of crispy pork belly.  in the words of my friend, "the fat exploded in my mouth."  he meant that in a good way.  the meat wasn't as tender or fragrant as i had hoped it would be though and the bbq sauce tasted like it came out of a bottle of kc masterpiece.  kinda killed the whole sandwich.   crispy pig's head - eh.  looked like a burger king hash brown and tasted like it came out of the same fryer.  i've never had pig head, but it just tasted like bits of cow face meat formed into a patty that was breaded and fried.  my friend described it as very "piggy" (again in a good way, because it was followed by an mmm, but even he ranked this dish last.  pickled vegetable aioli was special though, like a fancy relish mayo.   berries w/ vanilla custard and graham cracker crumbs - really tasty!  super sweet strawberry quarters, giant blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and beautiful dark purple leaves of OPAL BASIL (think really basil-y with a hint of licorice).  if you're looking for a light dessert, don't be turned off by the custard.  the custard was nice and light, and the berries win in the berry to custard ratio.  perfect ending to a carnivorous meal. overall, the food was good but not great.  i give this place 4 stars though for the sprawling menu that's more adventurous than most (pig ears, pig head, veal brains, rabbit spring rolls,etc.), friendly and attentive service, and cozy vibe.  great for a date especially since you can order a bunch of things to share.  definitely a fun place to try and more than once.

My husband decided on a whim to try this place out.  I'm glad we got there early to snag a bar seat, cuz the next available reservation wasn't until 10pm!  So make sure you plan ahead. An unmarked grey building on Fairfax - you know it must uber-trendy to survive without signage.  There is valet parking out front, but we were able to find street parking (2 hours, free after 8pm). Thanks to fellow YELPers, our menu is nothing surprising.  In order of yummiess: PORK BELLY SANDWICH - THIS IS AMAZING!!!  YOU MUST GET THIS!  Each order comes with 2 about the size of a softball, and trust me, you're gonna think you want both, but spare your arteries and only eat one.  Tangy barbeque sauce, with a little crunch from cole slaw, and the most sinful, thick slab of yummy pork belly.  I would come back for this hands down. Potato agnolotti with rabbit sausage -  I think the pasta dishes rotate (we were looking for the gnocchi), but we enjoyed this.  A mild ravioli stuffed with potato, though the star of the dish was the sausage.  Make sure you eat the 2 together, cuz the ravioli is a bit tasteless and mushy by itself. Marrow bone with chimichurri - We love bone marrow; we love buttered toast.  But the chimichurri/cilantro stuff was a little overwhelming.  Very tangy and salty, with a little spicy kick.  Kinda overwhelmed the marrow. Foie gras biscuit - There are several foie gras dishes on the menu - a cold "loaf," a Hawaiian inspired "loco moco," and this seared version.  Comes on a biscuit slathered with a maple syrup sauce.  A little heavy and sweet - wish I could have tasted the foie gras more.  Glad this came last in the meal, otherwise, my appetite would have been ruined for anything else. Bacon chocolate crunch bar for dessert - We had to get this after watching Duff's review on Food Network.  Very interesting dish - basically a layered chocolate bar with nuts, bacon bits for the crunch, nutella "fluff" (for lack of a better word), and (get this) salt and pepper ice cream.  Nothing mind blowing.  The ice cream is actually kinda weird by itself. The waiter had also recommended the Hamachi tostada, but we decided against purely because we didn't want to "over-extend" ourselves.  I'm also glad we didn't get the poutine.  Essentially gravy fries - looking amazing, but pretty huge - we would have passed out from food coma. I'm definitely not a big drinker, but the waiter was super nice and recommended the Reisling.  A little dry, but good.  My husband had the Hawaiian Mana Wheat; he says it tastes like a Hef (no idea what that means, I'm no beer drinker). All in all?  A nice experience.  Will I be eager to go back?  Prob not anytime soon - maybe if I get a craving for pork belly.

another place that's completely overrated. my boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner date and there's no point in listing what we had as their menu changes daily, but for your reference i'll include it: appetizer: pig ear with chili, lime, & fried egg $12 entree: balsamic pork ribs $19 grilled quail, plum char-sui, apple, pair, yogurt $19 dessert: chocolate bacon bar (duh) with salt & pepper ice cream $7 sticky toffee pudding $7 pig ear: this sounds totally unappetizing, but i think this was the best dish of the evening. it's an appetizer so the portion's small, but enough to share with two people if you can help it. pork ribs: heavily marinated in balsamic vinegar. it was delicious, but after a few bites the balsamic became a bit overwhelming. i felt it needed something to balance it out, but the dish was served with some squash, arugula, & pecans. i found the texture of the dish to be monotonous, lots of soft mush except for the occasional crunch from the candied pecan. grilled quail: this was my dish. i've had quail before and the way they presented it wasn't any more spectacular than what i've had in the past. quail is a smaller version of chicken, so expect a tiny little leg & wing to be on your plate. it was delicious, but not my absolute favorite. the combination sounds odd, but oddly enough, the flavors work in sync with each other. did i mention there's absolutely NO MODIFICATION on their menu? well, if you order this dish, you'll see why. the flavors and combinations they have on the menu is well thought out. i've gotta give these guys credit for their boldness in trying different flavors & ingredients. CONS: -ambiance: small, intimate setting is what was on their mind, but if there's a large party at the other table, forget about intimate. - you must make reservations, more info is available on their site but their hours are weird. i think you can walk-in, but expect to get turned down as this place can get very busy. - only valet or street parking if you're lucky. i've been lucky with finding parking on the street so i'd recommend trying that first. i like this place but i think the prices are a little steep, especially for the amount of food you get. i enjoyed the food, but even after eating my dish and having a few bites of the other two, i was still hungry. i guess they also charge you for their creativity?

First, I have to say that it is IMPOSSIBLE to get a hold of Animal over the phone...they almost never answer! I called for a whole week to try to make a reservation, and when I finally got through, I was put on hold for 10 min! Why?! Anyway, Animal is definitely a unique restaurant to try for the adventurous! Reservations aren't necessary for 6pm cuz that's when they open, but the restaurant started to fill up soon after, so do make reservations otherwise! Though the restaurant is small, it feels spacious because they don't try to in cram as many tables as they possibly can. chicken liver toast 3 - My favorite of the night...which bf got mad about because it's the absolute cheapest item on the menu. What can I say? It's good, generous amount of liver, and sweet! melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread 12 - Came out sizzling. Melted cheese, pepperoni, vegetables...can't go wrong! Personally, I thought it was a teeny tiny bit salty. barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw 12 - Delicious! One of the less unique items on the menu, but well worth it. The pork is soft, and the bbq sauce isn't overpowering. Comes with 2 little sandwiches. foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy 23 - I was looking forward to this one but was slightly disappointed. Nothing stood out, and it was WAY too sweet. It tasted like a dessert to us. And it took a long time to come out that it really was our dessert for the night! foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger 35 - This was bf's favorite but we both agreed it's overpriced. Taste wise, well balance of sweet, salty, and slightly spicy. Comes on a bed of rice. Because this place is called Animal, we didn't order any vegetable dishes, which I kind of regretted. I walked out feeling that my meal was incomplete, I needed something lighter for balance. Nonetheless, great service, great food, great adventure!

Having previously gone with other friends to this restaurant, my boyfriend decided to take my sister and I here to try things out. We made reservations a week in advance because they fill up quickly; they told us that they will hold the table up to 15 minutes after and the whole party has to be present in order to be seated. You can go in without a reservation, but expect to sit at the counter unless a group doesn't show up. When we arrived at our 6'o-clock reservation, the restaurant was closed with the gate down. I felt that if you make a reservation at 6pm, and arrive early, You should be able to go in and sit. When we were seated, they handed out waters and a menu with today's date on it, to show that it actually changes daily. We had a nice guy serve us along with an efficient staff to help: waters always refilled and dirty plates taken away. This is a tapas-styled restaurant where they recommend you order two plates per person. We ordered the bone marrow with chimichurri and caramelized onions; poutine with french fries, oxtail gravy, and cheddar; balsamic pork ribs with tomato and cucumber panzanella; crispy rabbit's leg with green beans and radish in a lemon herb sauce; and sticky toffee pudding with mascarpone and orange. The Bone Marrow was fatty; the chimichurri sauce--tangy herby with a light kick-- was spread over it and served with a side of buttered toast. You spread the marrow and the chimichurri sauce over the piece of toast and it's fatty, buttery, delicious. The Poutine is when a chili cheese fry and a french onion soup have delicious babies. This was my favorite dish of the evening. The Balsamic Pork Ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious, tangy due to the vignette. It came with a side of salad, but unfortunately, it was drenched in vignette, making it too strong. Sadly, I wasn't impressed with the Crispy Rabbit's Leg; It came served breaded with a lemon herbal dressing with green beans and radish. Rabbit tastes like a lean goose or a gamey dark chicken meat; good, but not really for me. For the money, I was expecting it to have more of a wow factor. For dessert, we ordered the Toffee Pudding served on a smear of mascarpone and with candied orange zest. I know this restaurant gets a lot of rave for its bacon chocolate bar, but my boyfriend has had it before and he doesn't like it at all. Once we bit into the toffee pudding, it wasn't too sweet nor was it too tart; a really nice balance of flavor that was very much enjoyed. Our tab came out to $90 for the five items between the three of us. This can balloon up pretty quickly if you decide to actually get two plates per person and drinks. Overall, the restaurant is good and we may come again.

Food here is fantastic! If I was rich I would have ordered one of everything. This is why people go to fancy places like these. Their food is just a cut above the rest. Chicken Liver Toast - Terrific! I would eat this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner if I could. Bone Marrow - Chimichurri works amazingly well with it. Spread it on garlic toast and it tastes like a dream come true. Soft Egg with Caviar, Bacon, and Yogurt - Separate it doesn't sound like they would work, but if you combine a little bit of everything it tastes simply divine. Balsamic Pork Ribs - When my tongue touched the meat it literally fell off the bone and into my mouth. I wouldn't be surprised if they slow cooked the meat for a whole week just to get that soft texture. So tender and flavorful. My favorite dish by far. Foie Gras Loco Moco - The most expensive dish on the menu. Not surprised because it tasted like heaven! Everything just works so well together. Rice cooked perfectly, meat is flavorful, spam is... spam, and add everything together with the foie gras and it's orgasm in your mouth! Tres Leches - Great dessert! Very moist and not too milky like most tres leches. Dulce de leche on top was creamy and not overly sweet. Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar with Salt & Pepper Ice Cream - Crunch bar tasted good and doesn't have an overpowering bacon flavor. Ice cream tasted kind of weird, but good. Not a bad combination at all. When I am rich I want to come and eat here everyday. I just want to shower them with money, so my mouth can go on a delicious flavor journey and die happy.

After hearing about this restaurant quite a bit from quite a few different people, me and my girlfriend finally had time to go enjoy a nice dinner here.  First impression of the place was interesting, no sign on the front door, nothing on the walls, basic chairs, wooden tables.  All very minimalistic.  We ordered the chicken liver toast, the pork ribs, the sliders, and the bone marrow.   First came the bone marrow... This was probably my favorite thing on the menu.  Came with two pieces of toast and a spoon to scoop up the marrow.  It was good to say the least. Didn't expect to enjoy this dish this much but the rich flavor of the marrow with the chimchurri was extremely enjoyable.   Next was the chicken liver toast.  It was like eating chicken spread on toast.  Girlfriend hated it I thought it wasn't too bad.  Not my favorite but would probably get it again because it is the cheapest thing there and a decent dish.   Next came out the sliders.  These were easily the second best.  Not too much barbecue sauce but the pork belly itself packed a lot of flavor.  I do not eat pig too often and thought this was delicious. The ribs I can say were probably the biggest disappointment.  Maybe it was because this was the last thing we ate and it didn't impress me much.  It was basically a good set of ribs, nothing too crazy about them.  I didn't care for the balsamic glaze very much but the ribs were extremely tender and fell off the bone.  However, I was just expecting a more unique flavor considering how interesting everything had been up to that point.  Maybe it was a bad idea to order ribs after eating at Bludsos BBQ a few days prior, but I didn't feel that way after the sliders! Wouldn't order this again, definitely not with that 18 dollar price tag.   Overall this place impressed me with their unique dishes and will probably come back to try the bacon crunch bar and some other dishes some time in the future. Price was okay ended up leaving there not spending as much as I thought I would.  Definitely worth coming and checking out at least once.

Let me just preface this with the fact that I rarely give restaurants 5 stars.  Animal was truly worth every one of them. Animal has been on my list of places to go check out, but kind of took a back burner when I found out that around their opening, they did not take reservations.  With a small dining area, I didn't feel like trekking down to the Fairfax District to try to wait for a table in hopes that I might eat there that night.  It's been some months, and I was ecstatic to find out they do take reservations. The dining area is dim, with recessed lighting.  Everything was so dark, plain and simple, but in a very sort of elegant way.  We received the menu and we had done some research before we came so we had time to think about what we wanted.  The dishes are PERFECT to share.  We got several items, split them all, and that was extremely filling.  I highly suggest doing this, if only to try more dishes they have to offer. Melted Petit Basque, Chorizo, Grilled Bread: I asked our server what was in this dish, and he said it was a bed of grilled onions, with slices of chorizo on top of that, and a wheel of cheese on top of that.  This was fantastic.  The chorizo was sliced like pepperoni, and the onions at the bottom were perfectly sauteed and grilled.  Neither of us are a fan of onions, but something about the way they were made, combined with the cheese and the chorizo on top of bread that was also grilled and salted was simply amazing. Poutine, Oxtail Gravy, Cheddar: This must be what eating in heaven is like.  No joke.  From the minute this plate was set before us, we could not stop diving into it again and again.  The oxtail, the gravy, the cheesey goodness over French Cut potatoes...Genius.   The fries stayed somehow crispy the entire time even after soaking in the gravy.  The meat was so tender, and  the cheese was melty and not overbearing.  The entire dish was a portrait of culinary perfection. Flat Iron, Sunchoke Hash, Truffle Parmesan Fondue: Just when you think you couldn't rave over the magic you just ate, a plate is set before you which looks like such a masterpiece you don't want to cut into it.   The medium rare flat iron sat atop a bed of sunchoke hash, with the entire creation saturated with the parmesan fondue.  Simply amazing, yet another dish we could not stop partaking of.   Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar, s&p Anglaise: Alright.  Seriously.  I rarely ever finish a whole dessert.  Normally I will pick at it as I am not a huge dessert fan.  I had to muster up all the self control I had inside of me to not eat this entire thing myself.  The bacon is perfectly placed ontop of the bar, and does not overpower the chocolate in any way, in fact the smokiness of it enhances it.  The crunch in the bar...WHAT IS IT?!  We forgot to ask our waiter what it was composed of.  I could have very easily eaten the entire thing, but I had to make myself stop.  You cannot go to Animal, and not get this treat.  The chocolate bar tied together our entire meal. I sincerely want to come back here, and I plan on it.  The wait staff: Wonderful.  Our waiter was attentive, my water never reached a half a glass as it was constantly being filled.  You might think the tables are sectioned too close together as the dining area IS very small, but trust that as soon as you get your first plate, you will not even notice anything around you. Yes, it is THAT good. PS:  Yelp lists this restaurant as "$$$"...A lot of people always wonder how expensive places are in accordance to the money rating.  This place was not as high priced as one would think.  Let's just say with all the food we got, plus Delerium  Beers, the tab was less than $100.00.  Great food, with inexpensive prices...Again: FIVE STARS!

Two friends and I went to Animal a couple of months ago. I had heard great things about it so I was excited to go. We had no reservations, but was seated in about 20 minutes. We brought our own wine & the waitress gladly opened it. We wanted to try a lot of items here what we chose & my thoughts: melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread-we all LOVED! I mean cheese & chorizo yum! barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw-I could of eaten 3 of these. The pork belly was so delicious, the sauce was good a little sweet just how I like it & the slaw was nice as well. potato agnolotti, caramelized onion butter, parmesan-I try agnolotti whenever it's on any restaurants menu & this was light, fluffy, cheesey-buttery goodness! poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar-basically fries w/ a meaty gravy and cheese...Not my favorite, but I just don't like cheesy gravy period. The meat was tender balsamic pork ribs, tomato & cucumber panzanella- This was my favorite, I love balsamic glazed items and this did not disappoint. I recommend this one! marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions-LOVED! I I am a marrow lover and this was excellent with the chimichurri and caramelized onions! We also had some sort of salad with raw greens, parmesan cheese and lemon. It sounds so simple, but it was delicious. Overall Animal's food is well seasoned and presented very nicely and simply! The service was friendly... I can't wait to go back!

if youre adventureous and like trying different ingredients then this is definitely worth a try. Its not EXTREMELY different but different enough for most people. I'm sure alot has been covered by other reviewers....i just felt the need to express my own opinion. Also, whenever we asked the waiter "which one is better", he would always have to say its hard to say which one is better, you just pick which one sounds more appealing or which one has more ingredients youd prefer. I believe him now....everything we had was very good- excellent. there was nothing that was bad....i only say the hamachi tostada was "ok" because in my world it wasnt THAT extraordinary.

Came here for my bday celebration. Shared multiple dishes so everyone can try many dishes of deliciousness.   Chicken Liver Toast - Amazing!  I would come here just to eat some chicken liver toast and leave and be satisfied. foie gras loco moco - $35 for a loco moco.  It better be the best loco moco I ever had.  And it was! bacon chocolate crunch bar - I like bacon, and i like crunch bars.  The combination was interesting, but I was not blown away.  The concept taste better in my mind than the the actual bacon chocolate crunch bar in my mouth.

Came here last night to celebrate a special day with the cousins, brother, and boyfriend. It's been on my must-try list for and I since was with some of my favorite company, I knew I was going to go all out! I wasn't blown away by everything, but I definitely wasn't disappointed. Favorites: Chicken Liver Toast- I would come here just for these. The liver melts in your mouth while the toasted bread is a nice crispy contrast. I love the rich earthiness and sweetness from balsamic and green onions. Soft egg- Slightly tangy Texas caviar with a soft egg topped with delectable pieces of bacon that dissolve on your tongue. Mmmm so good! Pretty Good: Pig Ear- This definitely had the most pronounced flavors of all we sampled. Combining the egg with the pig ear helped tone it down. Otherwise the crispy ear with chili reminded me of lime hot cheetos. Still good, just unusual. Coconut Sweetbreads- The presentation was gorgeous. It tasted just as good. It didn't wow me though. Marrow bone- Interesting gelatinous texture. The chimichurri was delicious. Not as Impressed: Foie Gras Terrine- I love foie gras! I don't know why this terrine tasted only like butter on toast to me :(   Veal Brains- I've had brain before, yet I was still hesitant to order this. I liked my first few bites, I didn't care for this dish so much. I could smell curry and taste pear, so I'm not sure where they were trying to go with this one. My tablemates also let me try these- Rabbit leg- I was surprised how good this was. I felt a little guilty at the thought of eating rabbit, but it was worth it. Halibut- One of the "safer" menu options, but not conservative in taste at all. One of my favorites of the night. Citrusy, rich, crispy,  juicy, and sweet all in one. We had one of each dessert and everyone had a different favorite. I recommend the bacon bar and tres leches cake! If you need something to cut through the fat after a rich meal here, go for the berries with mascarpone. Overall this place has some good to great dishes. It's worth a shot! Be prepared for the noise, make a reservation, and save up for the bill.

Went here last night and don't really get the big deal.  This is LA people, we have fancy tapas on every corner.  There is truly no need to deal with the noise level at Animal, period.  I went with just my boyfriend and we could barely hear one another.  And we were sitting in one of the more 'tucked away' tables, too.  Most of the tables are cafeteria style, another pet peeve. The food itself was alright but nothing stuck out all that much.  The priciest dish we got - the flat iron steak - was actually one of the worst.  So chewwy I didn't even finish it. The decor is so 'minimalist' it's totally boring.  The beer and wine selection were unimpressive, and the service was lacking.  To be fair, the busboy was one of the most hard working people I'd seen in a while.  The waiter however was a MIA snob. I think I'll stick to Upstairs 2, Bar Pinxto, The Yard, or maybe try one of the many, many other options before I'd return to Animal.   Not forgetting or forgiving the ridiculous noise level of all the patrons echoing voices, I will give them this; their music selection was absolutely perfect.  Could barely hear it but, very choice.

This place is amazing. It features eccentric--to most Americans--ingredients found in many cultural foods but reimagined to be savory to the American palette. For instance, one of the numerous tapa-style plates I devoured was veal tongue with smoked foie gras and crab apples with pastrami spices. It tasted like the most intense, delicate pastrami sandwich I have ever had. It's this kind of giddy experimentation couched in the safe confines of familiar flavors that makes this place remarkable.

In LA for the weekend and I ask an old friend who has lived here for over 10 years "Where should we eat"?  she tells me "Animal".   I check out the reviews and quickly call for a reservation. So......no name on the door - who cares!  I'm so thrilled that we snagged an 8:30 reservation, I don't care where they sit me. We only had to wait 10 minutes past 8:30 and our waiter was right on top of everything (Corey).  We both had the foie gras biscuit and the flat iron steak. It's everything people say on here - excellent, delicious and will knock your socks off!!! Oh yeah, it's loud but I secretly enjoyed that since my boyfriend is a "loud talker".  I didn't once have to ask him to stop screaming. We'll be back!

I went here for my birthday and the experience was outstanding. I hadn't made a reservation, but the hostess was so accommodating for my party of 4.  They were packed, and the expected wait time was about an hour, so my friend and I decided to walk around that area.  5 minutes later, the hostess called to let me know that 4 seats had opened up at the bar, and that she would hold them for me, even though not everyone from my party had arrived yet. Super score! And the meal...oh, the meal.  Probably the best meal I've had since moving to Los Angeles.  It started with grilled quail with a plum sauce, diced apples and peaches, and yogurt.  Amazing flavor combination-meaty, salty, sweet, creamy, tart. Then came the bone marrow with a chimichurri sauce...who doesn't love roasted bone marrow?!  The acidity from the chimichurri was a great addition because it cut through some of the fattiness of the dish.  The last plate was crispy rabbit legs with a lemon aioli and green beans.  This dish was soo tender, melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  And for dessert, we had (of course) their adult version of a candy bar--the bacon chocolate crunch bar. I'm pretty sure I don't have to go into detail about what a thing of beauty it was. Amazing service combined with thoughtful, exciting food is something that is hard to find.  Animal is a HUGE winner in my book.

Total flavor-gasm. My favorites were the hamachi tostada, pig ears, and anything with foie gras. Sadly, they were out of the poutine (another reason to return.) This is definitely a place where I'd keep coming back just to try everything on the menu.

I've been here a few times and have always enjoyed the food and "LA" feel to animal. I took a friend here for the first time for her birthday so she could enjoy a good meal and try a few different plates. Everything was going great until our final dish, my personal favorite, the poutine arrived. To my dismay, my friend pulled out a long black hair. We stopped eating and suddenly I could find no waitstaff to complain to. We sat there trying to get someone's attention. After five minutes I finally flagged down our waiter and told him about the hair. He didn't say anything...no apology or anything and just took our plates away. I just sat there assuming they were replacing it. They did replace it but again with no word. While waiting for dessert, a manager came over to ask about what happened. I told her and she apologized but in a defensive manner said no one had that hair in the kitchen...and that was it. No offer to comp the meal or even dessert. When I received the bill I was sort of surprised that the poutine was still charged and so was our dessert. I didn't want to make a big deal since I was treating my friend for her birthday. I was a bit disappointed at the waitstaff and manager's lack of concern for a very apparent long hair in our food, considering that this is one of the better restaurants in LA. When this happened to a friend at a burger joint, the manager managed to comp our meal, dessert, and gave us a coupon to come back.

marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions - Excellent. Fatty texture and chimichurri was great. melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread - Cheesy and good but nothing special. barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw - Best BBQ pork belly sandwich ever? Quite possibly. Pork fat/meat covered in their BBQ sauce with the tangy cole slaw was my favorite item out of everything we ordered. hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut - Light and fresh. I enjoyed this dish but my friends did not think it was worth getting. Too much veggies, not enough meat. veal brains, vadouvan, apple sauce, carrot - Texture was too soft for me. The coating did not provide enough contrasting crunch for me. Plus the thought of eating brain was slightly nauseating. Ordered this for fun. poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - Great gravy. Fries itself were good. Crispy outside, soft inside. balsamic pork ribs, delicata squash, arugula, pecan - i loved the delicata squash. The pork ribs were just okay. Would skip this and get another order of BBQ pork belly sandies. grilled octopus, chorizo, spicy brown mustard, chowchow - Octopus was soft, but the dish was just okay. foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - Too sweet. Skip this and get loco moco. flat iron, sunchoke hash, truffle parmesan fondue - This was perfectly cooked. No complaints. foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger - The quality of the foie gras is not great.  Also some bites were too salty but overall it was a good dish. berries, vanilla custard, lavender crumble, opal basil - This was interesting. The basil went well with the dessert. sticky toffee pudding, mascarpone, orange - I thought the pudding tasted more like a dense bread but it was still good. tres leches, dulce de leche - Good cake. Better than Porto's in my opinion. bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise - Salty, overhyped, etc.

First off, I'd like to say this was one of the most fantastic meals I've ever had. I found parking on one of the surrounding residential streets so try there if the streets are full. The restaurant is very small and doesn't have signage so it may be helpful to look for the Supreme sign next to it. It can be quite loud inside the restaurant, but it's tolerable. They played some great music when I was there. The restaurant is minimally decorated. It was also dim. foie gras, biscuit, sausage gravy- Was smaller than expected, but made up for that in flavor. It was very rich and indulgent. The maple syrup added a nice sweetness. poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar- hands down the best poutine I've ever had, and probably the best fry dish. Fry's are beautifully crisp. The gravy had a good thickness to it with what I'm assuming to be braised oxtail meat studded all around the plate. The plate was very large so I recommend splitting this with a friend. marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions- The bone meat was meltingly tender. Chimichurri added a nice bit of acidity but also added on to the fattiness with it's own oil. Onions were a really nice touch. All together, it was like meat butter with the garlic toast. foie gras loco moco-  an enjoyable play off the Hawaiian original. Foie gras is the new bacon. braised rabbit legs- Absolutely delicious! If you've ever had adobo, it tasted similar to that. Potato puree was very smooth and went well with the jus. Green beans added a nice bit of lightness to the dish. For dessert, my group had the tres leches, the bacon bar, and the berries and vanilla custard. All really nice desserts. I expected more custard, but I guess that's why it's listed as the second ingredient on the dessert. Overall, the meal was very heavy and many of the dishes had very bold flavors. If you're looking for something light or subtle, I suggest looking elsewhere.I look forward to dining here again, in this temple of meat and "boy food". You should go here before July when the foie gras ban goes becomes active, although I wouldn't be surprised if they sold it anyway.

What can you say. Quite possibly the best restaurant in the city. Just thinking of our meal makes my mouth water. The menu is always changing, but we had chicken liver mousse, sweet breads, crispy pig head, flat iron steak, bone marrow, rabbit and shrimp spring roll. We finished with a bacon chocolate thing for dessert. The food here is American cuisine at its finest. Make a reservation, or show up early or late and sit at the bar.

Boyfriend likes meat.  His birthday was coming up.  My coworker told me that Animal restaurant food really lives up to the hype.  I thought.. great, a place named Animal should have meat. And yeah.. they basically utilize all parts of that animal.  I mean.. ALL parts.  Pig tails, pig ears, liver, loins, brains anyone?   Yes.  In fact, the best dish was foie gras with biscuit and maple syrup.  I licked every drop of it.  I got my finger and wiped it clean when ppl were not looking.  It was good.   We also ordered the pork belly sliders..  to me this was a miss.  Like.. it was a chunk of pork belly, a big chunk.. but it was kinda dry... and I think this was their twist of a pulled pork sandwich (which should be messy and juicy and all over your hands and face), but it was dry, so a bit of a letdown.   We also ordered poutine, with oxtail and cheddar.  What's a poutine?  I don't know.. I don't even know how to pronounce it to this day.. But I think it's old fries.  Like.. triple fried old fries.  And again, this is a twist of another food.  I believe this is a stale cousin of the chili cheese fries.  And we finished it, just because we paid for it.. but my jaw hurt after..  It was a chore to chew.   Also ordered flat iron, sunchoke hash, truffle parmesan fondue.  I think this was good.  Pretty hefty in size, in comparison to all the other cute tiny appetizer plates.  Best meat I've ever had?  No. Cavatelli, lamb sausage, pecorino, pea tendrils, crouton: I ate this.  I copied and pasted the name, because I would not remember this.  What is it?  It's pasta, with lamb sausage, and croutons. This was awesome.  How do they get that pasta so chewy?  I have no clue. It was rich, creamy, and I remembered thinking.. there goes my caloric intake for the day. The service was good, because there were a lot of servers.  And they were nice.  I mean.. I understood like 5% of that menu because fries are poutines and pastas are cavatellis.  But you know, the servers are totally cool and translated everything in English for me.   Would I go again?  Yes.  But I'm not going to post on Facebook that I ate foie gras.. I got a lot of heat for that.

The girlfriend and I have been meaning to check this place out, and finally did last night.  We just wish we had tried it sooner, because it was hands down the best food we've had in LA.  The decor is simple, the waiters are attentive but not bothersome or pushy, and the food is outstanding.  Only downside is it's very noisy; like hard to hear across the table noisy.  Expect to spend about $60 per person, but trust me, it's worth every penny.   What we ordered, from best to least best (cause nothing was bad): Marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions - $10 By far the best dish we had.  The marrow is soft and buttery, and the chimichurri adds some extra flavor and spice.  Amazing. Barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw - $12 I've had some boring and bland pork belly before, but this was great.  Just some cooked-just-right pork belly and delicious BBQ sauce.   Rabbit sausage, morels, english peas, ricotta gnocchi - $15 This dish tasted really light.  It was also our first dish, and after we wondered if we had ordered enough, but I think they serve you your items in order of richness.  Really great starter plate, as the sausage was super tender, the sauce (pretty sure it was a cream sauce) was somehow light with a hint of lemon, and the gnocchi (which I rarely enjoy) was fantastic. Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - $23 Wow, was this one rich.  The foie gras is super rich, along with a biscuit and maple sausage gravy? Delicious, but wish we had had another person (or two) to split this with.   Sweetbreads, benton's bacon, creamy ramp dressing, parsley leaves - $14 The sweetbreads are fried, with some dressing and bacon.  You can barely tell you're eating sweetbreads, but can definitely tell you ate bacon.  The only complaint I have with the whole meal is that the bacon tasted like it was soaked in liquid smoke.  I can still taste it and smell it a day later.  Still delicious though.   We also split a carafe of their house Cab.  I'm no wine connoisseur, but I can tell you it tasted great. We skipped dessert, as we were too full.  But we're definitely looking forward to coming back and trying some of the other items (they had ribs that looked really good), maybe the marrow or pork belly again, and one of their desserts.

So happy I finally got here.  I liked everything about it, even the things I didn't like.  We arrived without a reservation but were happily and promptly seated at the bar. I guess it's obvious since I went to Animal that I like trying new foods.  I had the oxtail poutine which was incredibly good.  I remember poutine from my days visiting friends in Canada but I don't I'd ever eaten oxtail.  Now I wish I could have it every day. Even that was enough food for one, I also ordered the pig's head.  I thought it would be in bite sized pieces but ended up being in a patty.  It was OK but I didn't like the flavor even though I do enjoy some cabeza tacos. My friend ordered the pork belly sandwiches and really liked them.  I wish we'd ordered another pair.  We had the tres leches for dessert and it disappeared almost the moment it arrived. If only they had beer on tap.

I'm not going to go through all of the dishes I had but I'm going to say this: This place is crazy delicious. The end. I love the simple decor, good people watching, and small plates is my favorite so you can try a lot of things. The wine and beer list is pretty good. ALL of the food was DELISH-VILLE. The Foie Gras biscuit with maple sausage gravy was definitely a standout, but EVERY dish we got, we ate slowly and appreciated the flavors and it was just a taste explosion. I can't wait to try "Son of a Gun." their sister restaurant. Or brother? The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because some of the portions were RIDONKULOUSLY small. I understand the small plates concept but we got the Rabbit Loin Spring roll and although super yummy, it was literally two small bites a person, and SMALL bites at that. No joke. Exceptional place though. And the Mayor of LA was there. We stared for a while and then were sure it was him. Then on his way out he was a straight up a MAN OF THE PEOPLE, stopping at tables to shake hands, say hi and ask how their meal was. I mean, that's cool. We were stoned and covered in BBQ sauce so glad he didn't stop by ours. Overall advice: Go there.

I enjoyed my visit to Animal. The server was attentive and provided good suggestions when I couldn't decide between a few items. His suggestion ended up being my favorite dish of the night. But he could have been a little more friendly.  Also, like other yelpers indicated, it's a small space with very close tables. You can hear every bit of conversation occurring at the table next to you (and vice versa). Onto the food... We started with the chicken liver toast, which was good. The  chimichurri on top added to the flavor. It's only 3 bucks so an easy way to start the meal. Then we had the pork belly sliders. This was the dish recommended by the waiter. It was one of the best I've had. There was so much flavor on the meat itself, and then the  slaw on top was an excellent addition. Best dish of the night. Next, we tried the bone marrow with the same chimichurri sauce on it. This was my least favorite of the night, simply because the chimichurri overpowered the marrow, and I couldn't even taste the marrow at that point. I would have rather had a more subtle flavor with it. My friend and I each got a foie gras dish, and let each other have a bite. We each ordered correctly and liked our own better. I got the one with the biscuit and maple gravy, and she got the loco moco. I guess I'm a bit of a purist with my foie, as both dishes were a little heavier than I personally like, but they were tasting. The saltiness of the foie paired well though with the sweetness of the maple in my dish. I liked both dishes, but I probably wouldn't order them again. For dessert we tried the bacon chocolate bar, and the tres leches. I was sure I'd like the bacon choc better, but the server recommended the tres leches, which ended up being my preference. Very tasty. Although I did like the salt and pepper ice cream that came with the bacon choc bar. Overall, a good meal but very heavy. I enjoyed it while there, but my tummy wasn't so happy with me later. I was a little sick for the next 12 hours (not the restaurant's fault). I'm just not used to such rich foods right now.

Good stuff. Really good. We ordered entirely too much food and here are my highlights: The grilled baby broccoli with the soft egg on top and the striped bass dish were the two that could get me addicted to this place. The chicken liver toasts are a steal and really yummy - I didn't like chicken liver last time I tried it and this converted me. The bone marrow as well as the foie terrine with pickled pear (and the bread they give you to smear it on) make my mouth water to think about. Oxtail poutine was delicious but came at the end of our big meal so we ate all of about 2 bites (there didn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to order of dishes, which could be improved). Our table agreed that the low point were our veal brains - my first time trying brains and they mostly tasted like the batter and grease from being fried. Definitely a place to go when you're down to splurge - both with your wallet and your waistline.

A great tapas restaurant on Fairfax! *****The unique thing about this place is... they serve ALL kinds of meat from rabbit legs to rattlesnake, and the menu changes daily.  (Hence, "Animal.")***** We were a little over 15 minutes late last time on a date, and they gave our reservation away which was a bummer..  We had to wait quite a while for a table opening because it was so busy there, but we had wine to keep ourselves busy, and the food was well worth the wait. We ate quail, cod, bone marrow, pork belly sandwiches, and flat iron steak which were all DELICIOUS!

I love different kinds a meats so when a friend rewarded my girlfriend and me with a dinner at any place...we both chose animal. Weird things always impress me especially when they tast really good. Animal definitely came through. This is one of those trendy places, with great food but the prices are very reasonable. For a table of four they recommend 2 dishes per person, that sounds like a lot but its all family style. Here is what we had: Pig ears w/ chili & lime, hamachi tostada, yellowtail collar w/ house made kimchi, ox tail Putin, bone marrow w/ chimichurri, pork belly sliders, foie gras with biscuit & maple gravy, foie gras loco moco. Wine & bacon chocolate bar, tres leeches & a berry w/vanilla custard crumble.... Wow it was a spectacular meal! I cannot mention how good the bone marrow and the foie gras dishes were. I mean these pieces of foie gras were like a large fish filets. The foie gras and gravy dish just melted in my mouth. The loco moco though the expensive dish out of all, was just divine. I The place is fairly sized and the staff had great recommendations. I only wish I could try everything, but I guess I will wait for my next visit. We have heard so many things about this place and it actually lived up to its name. We are now going to visit Son of a Gun since I am a big fish fan. I hope its as good as Animal.

Loved it. Let me first say, the Foie gras loco moco (with quail egg, spam, hamburger on risotto) is probably one of the best things I've ever eaten. We also had the Flat iron tritip with sunchoke hash and truffle parmesan fondue, the chicken liver toast (excellent, but I prefer the one I had at Spotted Pig in NYC), and the Chimichurri marrow bone with caramelized onions. Good lord, just writing those dishes out is obnoxious, but they were really good. For dessert, we had to try the bacon chocolate crunch bar. It was just aaite. There aren't too many places I would shlep all the way out this far just to eat at, but I would come to Animal again.

I want to start off by saying that I love a place that is hidden or hard to find. It makes the the whole experience (because this restaurant is an experience) that much better. There is no sign indicating the name of the restaurant, so if you are not familiar with the area, just look for a dark little restaurant packed with patrons dining inside and waiting outside. If you are not willing to take a culinary journey while at this restaurant, don't go. If you are looking for steak, potatos, grilled chicken, fries, etc etc. Don't go. And definitely don't ask for substitutions because they do not allow it. If you like to explore....GO!!!! Our waiter's name was William and was by far my favorite waiter I have ever had when being in LA. He was friendly without being fake and very helpful when explaining their wine selection which is very different than what I'm used to seeing. He suggested we each ordered two things. So we did just that. To make this review easier for those of you just quickly trying to see what is good while sitting at the actual restaurant, I am going to rate the dishes from 1-5. This is pretty much based on what all 5 people in our party so this is not an opinion coming from one palette. (I regret not trying the Bone Marrow. Sorry I can't tell you much about that...but I read mixed reviews here on Yelp) Foie Gras Loco Moco - 4 Pig Tails - 4 BBQ Pork Ribs - 2 Trout Salad - 3 Melon Salad - 4 Hamachi - 5 Potato Agnolotti  - 5 Halibut - 4 Bacon Chocolate Bar - 4 Tres Leche - 2 I believe there were some other things we ordered, but if I do not remember it's for a reason. They had run out of the Pork Belly and the Chicken Liver which I know are popular. I will definitely come back and have to try those as well.

Voila! My first yelp review ever, and of course, I rightly choose Animal. I went there a couple of weeks ago, and it had probably one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in LA. Was the service amazing? Nope, it was average, can't complain. Greatest tasting food ever? Certainly not, the dishes were either hit or miss. Then why was this one of my greatest dining experiences ever? It was the combination of the dishs' creativity, taste, and most importantly, the company I was with. I guarantee you, that if you plan your trip at the right time and go with your foodie friends that are willing to go outside of the box, this place is (so far, in my opinion) the best restaurant I've been to in LA. So after reading reviews on yelp, we made reservations at 6:15pm on a Thursday. Our group of three (tip: optimal group size is 4, bc that's how the dishes are portioned) had no trouble finding street parking on Fairfax across from Animal. Walked in only a couple tables full, sat down ordered a beer, asked for recommendations, and here we go (if someone from bud light is reading this, I will write this in all my reviews for sponsorship ;)) Food Review (categorized into tiers) Blah: Petit Basque - I hated it. Way too much cheese. Couldn't really taste anything else. (we actually ordered the "bass", they messed up, but nothing could ruin this experience because my friends and I were having a blast) Poutine with ox tail - Don't get me wrong, this was a good dish. The ox tail was super tender. At any other restaurant, it's probably a goto dish. But, it just wasn't a must get dish at a place like this. Bacon Chocolate Bar - Save your $7, just go to Scoops... Whatever Just Do It: Chicken Liver Toast - It's $3, just get it. lol. I liked it, creamy, delicious. My friend hated it, said it reminded him of liverwurst? Just try it for yourself...it's $3. Veal Brains - disgusting, worst thing ever. lol BUT, with the right people, trying it was really really fun and entertaining. Get It or Regret It: BBQ Pork Belly Sliders - I hate pork belly. The other ways I've tried it, I think it's too fatty, not worth the taste. This sandwich was BOMB. Melty, tangy, great. Bone Marrow - I've never had bone marrow until now, but have heard the hype. The bone marrow comes out like a gelatin with chimichurri. Delicious. Melting in your mouth is a nice theme to these three dishes. Foie Gra with biscuit and maple gravy - once again, the foie gra (one of my favorite dishes) just added another layer of goodness onto a classic dish. Total for 3 ppl with a beer each: ~$150 The moral of the story kids is that what makes Animal one of the best dining experiences in LA isn't the service, trendiness, or a can't go wrong menu, it is the creativity of the food and the quality of preparation to carry the creativity thru. Therefore, with the right company and an open mind, Animal is truly a 5-star dining experience.

Decor: Quite simple Ambiance: Loud and crowded Food: Tasty...except for the rabbit dish... Service: Friendly and helpful~ Price: A bit pricey... Ok, before I begin with my review on the dishes, what's more important to know is that you should make a reservation before coming! Otherwise your wait would be around 1 hour... Zucchini Salad: Good portion and was flavorful.  The sliced yellow and green zucchini was tossed in a vinergrette dressing topped with shaved aged parmesan cheese and baby red and yellow tomatoes.  Would order this again! Grilled chicken heart: Was not rubbery! Cooked just right and was flavorful as well.  The dish could have used a bit more Baba ghanoush to go with the crispy pita bread. Foie Gras over biscuit: Surprisingly delicious!! Almost like a savory dessert!  The perfectly seared foie gras rests on top of a fluffy on the side and crispy on the outside biscuit which sits on a creamy sauce with bits of sauage meat in it.   Eat all the componets together and it is devine! Would order this dish again! Crispy Rabbit legs: The meat tasted to gamey...and the sauce was just a overkill and too heavy. Personally, I did not enjoy this dish and hope they will replace it with a different dish to choose from soon. Parking: Valet available, meter parking, and limited street parking.

went as a party of 4, but we all agreed that this place would best serve couples. regardless, it was a good experience with great, creative food (but pretentious service.) however, while food was REALLY delicious and full-flavored, i don't think i'd come back, just bc of the service & price. stand-out dishes: - marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onion - served w. two slices of toast. very simple and delicious - foie gras, biscuit, maple-sausage gravy - favorite dish! huge piece of seared foie gras atop a buttery, crumbly biscuit with delicious sweet-savory gravy. what's not to love?! - flat iron steak, truffle parmesan fondue, potatoes - perfectly cooked, delicious fondue sauce on top - foie gras loco moco - very VERY rich and fun dish. flavors all complimented each other. loved the subtlety of the quail egg, the random deliciousness of the spam, the fresh quality of the burger, and of course, the seared foie gras on top. we didn't try the bacon chocolate bar, but had the berry crumble and tres leches cake. skip the dessert here. it's not very memorable...

Way better than I was expecting and I was expecting it to be really good. It's fairly casual and the service was very good too. Here's what we had: poutine oxtail gravy - like junk food good marrow bone - tasty, but a tad vinegary crispy pigs head - way better than it sounds, reminded me a little of corned beef BBQ Pork Belly sandwiches - mouth melty yum! coconut sweetbreads - delicious Foie gras loco moco - Hawaiianish with spam & egg! rabbit legs - probably my least favorite but I'm not a rabbit fan. It was the best rabbit I've ever had though. Not too gamey. Wish I saved room for the bacon chocolate crunch bar, maybe next time.

4.5 stars!! My wife and I decided to go here for a rare date night...we were blown away. Yes, it was a bit loud. But, the atmosphere was great, with music that helped set the mood.  The staff was very nice and seated us despite our not having a reservation.  Even though they asked us to finish by a certain time, nobody was hounding us to clear out. The food was amazing.  We had a beet salad, sweet breads, marrow, short ribs, and flat iron steak.  We had sticky toffee pudding for desert...and coffee. OMG!   With the exception of the sweet breads which were not awesome, the meal was fantastic.  The flat iron and the short ribs knocked us out.  The marrow with toast was incredible.  The beet salad was delicious. Desert was just sweet enough with a taste of orange zest...the coffee was very good. Well worth the price....including the $20 corkage. Will definitely go there again.  Hopefully very soon!

Very impressive.   I love to try something different and I was a bit suspicious when I heard about Animal as it seemed from the menu that they were trying to be different, just a little too hard but they put my money, where my mouth was and produced a fantastic tapas style meal. My only qualm about the place, is that it seems like they're trying to get 1-2 tables too many in.  We were on a two person table and my back was almost on the person behind us. The menu is very eclectic but it differs to other high concept eating in that it retains very firm American roots (with a little Asian thrown in) instead of French style which many places try to emulate. Our choices: Pig's tail cooked Buffalo Wing style : the simple idea but great taste as the meat falls off the bone, made me want to laugh.  What a great dish. Bone Marrow : almost obligatory since Fergus Henderson introduced this salad but this was a delicious piece of bone split length ways with correctly seasoned lucious marrow with a bread to spread it on.  Excellent. Veal Brains : this dish was the only let down.  The brains were delicious, floured and fried for they were light and creamy with the crisp of the batter, just enough.  Their should have been a few more pieces and the sauce was over-sweet/fruity which overpowered the taste a bit.  Still good though. Rabbit legs : must have been from the largest rabbit you've ever seen.  Two very generous legs, panko breadcrumbed and deep fried.  Sounds simple but it was deliciously tender and juicy.  Possibly the best rabbit ever. Pig's Face : the best bits of a pig.  Nose, cheeks, ears and chin, brined and made into a patty, tossed in breadcrumbs and lightly fried.  The pieces of tender pork fall apart and the textures and nuances of the meat are full.  A great dish. Foei gras "biscuits and gravy"- I believe this is their signature dish and I wasn't that excited as Iove foie gras in it's most simply pan fried form.  How wrong I was.  The base of this dish, the biscuit supports the whole dish, it's the best biscuit I have ever tasted, light, flaky, salty and it supported a perfectly cooked piece of foei gras surrounded by a maple syrup/sausage gravy.  I laughed out loud as the first taste hit my mouth, it was simply out of this world.  Unexpected, sweet, salty, fatty yet not over the top.  Everyone needs to try this dish. Two good eaters left complete after the above meal, with a bottle of wine and a beer to start, the bill came to about $200. If you are a foodie you owe it to yourself to try Animal.  Just bring a friend who will appreciate it with you.

The food was so good that it overshadows the very unprofessional girl who took our orders. I don't know if she was in a bad mood or what, but she shouldn't have been like that, all frowning, not answering our questions and just plain rude. Good thing another waiter replaced her and  he definitely compensated for her lack of professionalism. So about the food. We had the roasted bone marrow, the bbq pork sliders, rabbit sausages w/ gnocchi, pig ears with egg and the oxtail poutine. ALL were so good! I actually thought I wasn't going to be full from these since they were all small but surprisingly I was stuffed! I didn't even want dessert anymore. And for all of that, it was about 80 dollars with tip already.. so not bad at all. My advice is to definitely order the poutine. I think it was an experience. Hard fries with gravy, cheese and beef?? Insane! It was so rich though.. but hey, it's worth it.

Is it offal or awful? I don't know but it's offal-ly good!!! Animal, the restaurant that makes eating weird shit fun! They'll serve you the inside of an animal's asshole and have you licking your fingers when you're done. It's like the gourmet version of Fear Factor. I had been wanting to go to Animal for quite some time but the place is really popular. They don't need your business, and they know it. If you come without reservations expect to wait just to sit at the bar. Since the place is very busy, the bartenders are way too cool for you. They might be pissed because they have to tend bar and wait tables, who knows? Try ordering a drink or asking a question and they look at you like "What the fuck do you want?". In addition to this we were slightly over-charged which I'm assuming is some kind of asshole tax... The service notwithstanding, the food is excellent.  Pork Belly Sliders, Octopus, and foie gras with maple gravy were among the standouts, but everything was good. The portions are small but heavy, like lead bullets, so you can order a few and share. The foie gras was really delicious. Perfectly seared, buttery and rich. So good I want to personally jam a feeding tube down a goose's throat while masturbating over a PETA poster. For dessert we ordered the famed bacon chocolate crunch bar, which I really enjoyed. I dived right in like an "animal" and when I was done it looked like a crime scene. Somehow I got chocolate on my elbow, like I was fisting the dessert instead of eating it. Regardless, you know something is good when you're in such a haze that it ends up on your elbow. Animal has top notch cuisine in a bar atmosphere. If you want to hang out with some friends, be comfortable, relax, and have your ass kissed by the staff, Animal is not the place. However, if you want hang out with a friend, have a couple beers and enjoy some truly unique and tasty food, Animal is perfect for you.

Excellent!!! it really lived up to the hype. we tried 8 dishes and they were all hits except for one (veal brains). but even the veal brains weren't bad, it just wasn't as good as everything else.  service was good. hostess was extremely polite and welcoming. the waiter was very informed on all the menu items.  if planning to come, you must make reservation at least two weeks in advance. this is an extremely popular spot.   Very HIGH RECOMMENDATIONS!

Animal serves modern and interesting small plates. Overall, I find it difficult to create a coherent meal as all the dishes are so unique and different. The flavor profile of the dishes go from sweet, to spicy, to blend. The order in which the dishes are coming may have a large impact on how enjoyable your experience will be Our table tried: Pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg: It is a slightly spicy dish. The pig ears are thinly sliced in julienne and fired in oil. The fried egg is a good addition but the dish does not come with bread!!!! ( ask for bread as you order the dish. You will be charged for the bread.) The flavor is spicy eggy crispy. No pork flavor really. Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar: It was the best dish of the night. But It feels me with sadness to write that the best dish was fries with gravy, cheese and meat. It is a great poutine. The fries are hand cut. The oxtail gravy is more a delicious stew than a gravy as it has large pieces of meat. The flavors are great. However the cheese curds where not melted. So great unfinished poutine. Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy: It is a nice foie gras poelle served on a biscuit with a sweet gravy.The foie gras used for the dish has a nice blood vein. It happens but  I deducted it was not Hudson Valley quality. The server confirmed it was Canadian foie gras. The gravy was too sweet, and too heavy pushing the foie gras taste in the background. Too bad. Bacon chocolate crunch bar, salt & pepper ice cream: It is an interesting idea but to me it is not a dessert as the chocolate sweetness is overpowered by the saltiness of this rather small dish. No bacon flavor. The chocolate is great. The ice cream is fun until you bite on a big piece of pepper that numbs your taste buds. Order a sweet dessert after this one. The alaskan halibut, corn, wild fennel, chanterelle, lobster butter looked great. The barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw are mini burgers. The house wine is a great value. The place has a minimalist decor. It feels like eating in a garage. I may go back when the menu changes. ( if it changes...)

I really, really wanted to like Animal. It's a bit pretentious--no sign, no need to actually decorate the restaurant, and no need to serve anything that could be served at an Applebee's--but alas, it was not to be. I went here a month ago with my boyfriend, his sisters and their boyfriends. The staff and hostess are nice enough--nothing to complain about and nothing to rave about. We ordered up what felt like everything on the menu to get as much in as we could. 1. Chicken liver pate: my bf said it best when he said "I've never really understood what the word 'gamey' meant until now 2. Salads: Decent, but lacking the flavor of some of the other dishes 3. Poutines: As someone who lived in Quebec City for 3 months (and bought the same thing for about 50 cents) I was just 'whelmed' by these. 4. Pork Belly sliders: After all the rave reviews, I was pumped to try these. Um I think they forgot the pork. Try fat fatty sliders because that is all I could taste. 5. Himachi: Nice flavor, good presentation There were other savory dishes, but left no impression. BUT the reason I give this pricey hotbed of food pretension more than one star is the desert. The tres leches cake is the best I have ever had (a title previously held by 112 Eatery in Minneapolis). The cake is just the right consistency to soak up the delicious milky flavors and the whipped frosting has just the right lightness to complement the heaviness in the bottom of the cake. I could eat this all day long, every day. Save yourself and just go here for dessert!

This is probably going to be the shortest review I've ever written because there's not much more you need to know except that it's an unbelievable experience...if you love meat. The service was fabulous (our waiter was super friendly, patient and funny).  Every dish that came out was amazing (and we ordered a good portion of the menu). We weren't gung-ho about every dessert (we got 3), but we still finished them all.  ;op Lastly, even though the hostess wasn't too happy that our entire party wasn't there on time (so we were seated 15 min later) and told us that we'd have to be out of there by 8:30, our waiter never rushed us.  Since we ordered a lot, and the food came out when it came out, we were there til about 9.  Good stuff!!

So glad we found this restaurant, although it was difficult to find - small space, no sign on the front.  Just look for the building space with 435 on the front.  It was 10:00 pm and still packed, but we were fortunate enough to get a table right away.  Service was friendly and fast.  We ordered the crispy pig's head, veal sweetbreads, veal tongue, and foie gras with biscuit and gravy.  All were delicious and RICH!  We were disappointed that they ran out of the marrow bone...we were looking forward to that one.  But the foie gras more than made up for it!  The food at Animal is wonderful, but very rich, so you must order the hot mint tea at the end of the meal.  It helps!

My opinion of this place doesn't really matter at this point, after some 800-odd reviews, but oh well, you must suffer through it anyway. This place is smaller than I imagined it to be and quite sparse on the design. Cream colored walls adorned with clear light bulbs and 2 small animal skeletons framed near the entrance. Simple wooden tables and an unpretentious vibe from such a popular joint. The service was a bit slow, but our waiter was not to blame, he looked super busy. But he was well-versed on the menu and he had a great attitude, not fake LA, not fake sweet, just overall nice. My boyfriend was just disappointed in their beer selection, or lack there of. We finally found a winner in the scotch ale though. We started our night with a chicken liver toast, garnished with balsamic/caramelized onions...it was naturally tasty. Jumped into the hamachi tostada...at first it seemed similar to a Thai tuna salad I make on occasion, but it actually revealed itself in layers. It was executed quite well with Serrano chiles, peanuts, basil, cilantro and a citrusy flair. The kale salad in lemon vinagrette was acceptable, so were the pig tails "buffalo style", nothing exceptional. The rabbit sausage was unmemorable. The foie gras and Asian pear complimented each other well, but still lacked that special something. We then partook of the pork belly sliders. Even the cole slaw was tasty and am not a fan of slaws. The pigs ears with chile and fried egg...now that was good old comfort food, reminiscent of Mexican snack food...this dish put a grin on my face. This was followed by a surprisingly sweet octopus and then we finished off with the dish that made me giddy with delight! The foie gras on a biscuit with maple sausage gravy. Now that was simply awesome! Didn't even need dessert!

I went here for a friend's birthday. Parking is $5.50 for valet or if you're lucky, free on the street. The restaurant is small so I strongly recommend to make a reservation. The service is okay--not bad, not awesome. The food is amazing! There is nothing that I did not like. The poutine oxtail gravy was good to start with. The barbeque pork belly sandwich with slaw is another tasty dish. The flat iron was good; tender and juicy! The balsamic pork ribs was my favorite. It was so tender; the meat would just fall off the bone. The melted petit basque with chorizo on grilled bread was not bad but it was my least favorite. No full bar but very good wine selection. Pricey but worth it. Good for small group dinner, not romantic, loud. If you like good different food, go ahead--make a reservation and eat here!

Rather than spew effusive praise on everyone at Animal -- from the darling hostess who bonded with my party of five (Yes! i've always wanted to slip a PO5 reference into a Yelp review) over the annoying group who long outstayed their welcome and delayed our being seated to the attentive and friendly server to the masters in the kitchen -- I'm just going to give you a rundown of everything we consumed with little notes about each dish. Hamachi Tostada, Herbs, Fish Sauce Vinaigrette, Peanut - Texturally great. A nice crunchy shell with soft chewy fish and a hit of heat from some raw jalapeno. The green cabbage slaw was bright and citrusy. Thai BBQ Quail, Scallion, Citrus, Cashew, Yogurt - Surprisingly light, grilled and spiced expertly. It made me wish we could genetically engineer quails with larger legs. Chicken Liver Toast - I've always hated the idea of chicken livers. It used to be a staple of family reunions and get-togethers and it grossed me out. I'm glad this was my first taste of it. Awesome. Foie Gras Terrine, Pickled Cherry, Black Pepper - This was one of the stars of the meal. It melted in your mouth like butter. One of the most decadent flavors of the night. Marrow Bone, Chimichurri, Caramelized Onions - Another star dish. One of my friends was licking the bone clean when the server came to take the plate away. Sweetbreads, Benton's Bacon, Creamy Ramp Dressing, Parsley - Just kind of took on the flavor of the batter but the bacon added a nice amount of saltiness to it. Melted Petit Basque, Chorizo, Grilled Bread - Between the sweet, creamy cheese and the chorizo it was a bit too heavy for me but the bite or two I had still tasted great. Pig Tails, "Buffalo Style", Celery, Ranch - Tasted like a jerkied buffalo wing. I can't believe there was ranch involved and I still ate it. I hate ranch with a passion. Had I paid closer attention to the menu I might have passed on this dish. So glad I didn't. Poutine, Oxtail Gravy, Cheddar - Another favorite. I know it's a little blasphemous to stray from the traditional cheese curds and gravy recipe, but one taste of the oxtail meat sold me on the dish. Flat Iron, Artichoke Hash, Truffle Parmesan Fondue - I didn't much care for this one. The steak was cooked a bit above the requested medium rare. I liked that hash more than the meat. Pig Ear, Chili, Lime, Fried Egg - Nice sweet and sour flavor mixed with runny egg. Perfect. Veal Brains, Vadouvan, Apple Sauce, Carrot - They were battered and fried, and although texturally a little gooey it was so buttery and creamy I hardly noticed. The apple sauce had a sweet, syrupy flavor that I thought complimented the richness of the brains nicely. Mmm...brains. Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar, Salt & Pepper Ice Cream - I was a little underwhelmed by the crunch bar. I thought the salt and pepper ice cream was superior. It seems so obvious: salt and pepper plus ice cream. Of course it works! Tres Leches, Dulce De Leche - This was the better dessert in my opinion. Incredibly moist cake, and the dulce de leche at the bottom was fantastic. The house Chardonnay was delicious and a steal at $20 a bottle. Also, sorry we drank you guys out of all your Alley Cat Amber Ales!

Per Yelpers' recommendations, my friend and I ordered the following superb dishes for two: -chicken liver toast 3 -marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions 10 -barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw 13 -foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger 35 -tres leches, dulce de leche 7 and every dish was amazing! Everything was exactly what I had expected and I will be making this my regular go-to spot. I haven't had a decent marrow dish since Crispo's in New York, and I loved that it was rich in flavor and DEEP. As in, there is much to dig out. The portion we got at Angelini Osteria in LA was laughable and I was starting to miss what I thought only NY could offer.  Chicken liver toast was delicious. Loved their buttery brioche pairing than the usual crisp bread. The BBQ pork belly sliders were just perfect. It's one of those foods I will probably start craving on a daily basis because I was disappointed that it was slowly disappearing out of my hands, AS I was eating it. And I secretly hated my friend at that moment for eating away the second best pork belly sliders I would have had that day. The foie gras was a little disappointing, because again, it was a bit salty. Only a handful of restaurants can get the saltiness right. Tres leches was tasty. but I'm not a big fan of cakes, so next time I'll be trying the chocolate bacon biscuits. I love you, Animal. I promise I will never turn vegetarian. p.s. The portions are small, so get many plates. p.s.s. Andrew Garfield of the movie The Social Network was there when we were dining. cool!

So it's First Friday in Venice, and you've just finished eating your way through every food truck on Abbott Kinney.  You don't know how it's possible, but it's close to midnight, and you think that a miracle is occurring; you might be able to eat a little more.  'Where to now?!" you ask fervently.  The answer, of course, is Animal. I had the great pleasure of trying out Animal quite recently and finally understanding all of the enthusiasm; this place is fantastic.  Since my co-binger for the evening and I were both a little full from the food truck extravaganza, we shared three items: the halibut, the quail, and the chocolate bacon bar.   In a nutshell, our minds were blown, our stomachs were bursting, and our food comas were SO worth it.  This is easily one of the best spots in L.A. right now.  Investigate immediately if you have yet to do so.

This restaurant lives up to its reputation. A very fun, chill atmosphere. Great music with great people. The place is small, maybe 14 tables-16 tables with available bar seating. The food was fantastic. My friends and I ordered one of everything. The waiter had to ask us twice to make sure he heard right. Some of my favorites are the foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger; thai bbq quail; flat iron, sunchoke hash, truffle parmesan fondue ;grilled baby broccoli, soft egg, pancetta vinaigrette, parmesan; poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar. The desserts were awesome. I dont think you can go wrong ordering anything from the dessert menu. There are a lot of salads on the menu that i could have personally done without but it was still good. Price is reasonable in my opinion. Definitely go with some good friends.

It's an extremely small restaurant, so you might want to try for opening (6 p.m.) at the bar if you can't get reservations. That's what we did, and we were lucky that there was a cancellation so we got a table. Our server recommended that we got 4 dishes to share, but being the foodies that we are, we got 5 :) - bbq pork belly sandwiches - poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - hamachi tostada - grilled baby broccoli, soft egg, pancetta vinagrette, parmesan My favorites were the foie gras, poutine, and broccoli. The foie gras goes without saying. It's a must if you come. The fries in the poutine were perfect and the gravy was thick, savory, and delicious. The broccoli was my personal favorite because it's unlike anything I've ever tried, and I needed some kind of veggie to break up all the meat! I liked the hamachi (super fresh) but couldn't help hoping for some spiciness to it since it was so acidic. Also, we ordered a bikini blonde, which came in a can and was $8! I thought that was a total ripoff, even if it's made in Hawaii. Our server sort of disappeared after taking our order and reappeared for the check... And last but not least, parking can be a little difficult. We ended up parking right next to a bum (I guess he was looking after our car for us...)

This is one of those places that you have to at least (or only) eat once in your lifetime though the meal will probably take off 5 years from your life. Kind of an oxymoron but if you call yourself an adventurous foodie, you just gotta do it. The name is very fitting for the restaurant because you seriously feel like a beast after you finish your food. Everything is very greasy, buttery, and heavy but it's what they're trying to get at. I'd say they do a pretty good job of it. When I ate here, I got the chicken liver toast (which was just okay). BBQ pork sliders though are a must... very delicious. The bread is soaked in butter or something because it melts in your mouth like ice cream. The poutine with oxtail gravy and cheese is good but a bit salty. And you have to get something with foie gras if you've never tried it elsewhere. It's goose liver I believe but don't be alarmed, it's super good. It's like the ultimate fat food ice cream experience. To be honest, I've only eaten here once. But, I'd definitely come again to bring friends to try it. Just make sure you space out your visits a little.

Was here on Friday night with my two friends who had booked 1 month in advance.  This was a delightful LA foodie experience!  The waiter was fantastic & experienced and helped us decide not only what to get but in which order to eat, and it was a pitch-perfect experience.  We were also served and helped by many staff in the restaurant and we felt very well taken care of. Started with Hamachi Tostada and the burrata.  Delicious, light and bright. Moved on to the Pork belly brioche mini-sandwiches and melted petit basque, hearty and savory and delicious. Ended with oxtail poutine and ribs- so rich and fantastic.   We got a bottle of the house wine and were very pleased with it.   All in all, the staff understands how to help you create a delicious dining experience which sates without feeling too heavy. Only (slightly) weird thing: the staff love when you have a clean plate and will obsessively replace your plate, which had the hilarious effect of feeling like we were sitting at a Mad Hatter's tea party.

Overall 4.5 stars. SERVICE: 5 FOOD: 4.5 Our server was amazing. My SO and I decided to treat ourselves since we were in LA for one night only. We didn't have reservations but we grabbed a drink at the bar across the street while we waited. They're kind enough to call your cell when your table is ready.  We let our server create our experience. He suggested a lot of items we were eyeing. He was funny, friendly, and didn't try to over-sell. MUST HAVE: Foie Gras biscuits and gravy - salty, sweet, AMAZING BBQ Pork Belly Sliders - flavorful, not greasy or overly fatty, the best pork belly of the sandwich kind. YUM to Try Hamachi Tostada - Asian/Mex fusion. The fish sauce definitely makes it more asian. A good light starter Good, but could have passed Pig Ears (not because I don't like pig ears, they're good as was this dish but it wasn't OMG that was amazing. I think they were also a big on the saltier side) DESSERT Our server suggested the Tres Leches but we couldn't take our eyes off the chocolate bacon crunch bar.   Though we valued our servers opinion very much, we had to go for the most ordered dessert, the chocolate bacon crunch bar. We asked why it was so popular and our server told us it was once featured on Food Network show "Best thing I ever ate: Bacon."  That explained it all.  It was very rich, but delicious and the bacon wasn't overpowering.  Good to try but I'm also curious about that Tres Leches cake. The overall experience was wonderful and our server was one of the best servers I've had.

Came again and had another epic meal. Ordered probably 12-15 things for 4 people to share. Everything awesome as always. Avoid the large entree dishes except the biscuit and share a ton of the smaller plates is my recommendation. Hands down favorite restaurant.

Dining at Animal can only described as the Cirque du Soleil of food. Is it weird? Yes. But is it also impressive and a fun experience? Yes and yes! It's definitely NOT you "everyday" kind of food...the dishes were by and large INCREDIBLY delicious, but there were a few that, after one or two bites, I was feeling like, "ok, I'm good to go". Here's the run-down of what we ordered:    *  Hamachi Tostada: on one level, my favorite dish, because it was       one of few that we ordered where I felt like I really wanted to eat           the whole thing. It was SUPER delicious and had such great           flavors and spice.    *  Thai BBQ Quail: We really enjoyed this one...just wished there        had been more of it! Those quail legs are so very small...    *  Pork Belly Sandwiches: An instant favorite, and of course one of        the more "normal" items on the menu...my only criticism was that        I felt that they were a bit greasy and the buns ended up being a        little bit soaked, but I know that pork belly is pretty juicy, so I guess        that's to be expected.    *  Foie Gras, biscuit and maple sausage: HAD to try this a) after all        the great reviews, and b) since foie gras is going to be a thing of        the past come 2012. I was not disappointed! It was SUPER rich,        but also SUPER delicious...it has earned all of the fame it has        garnered.    *  Pig Tails: No, not the hairstyle sported by little girls...I personally        wasn't as huge a fan of these, as they were very fatty (surprising, I        know), but I think that's more personal taste than anything else,        because some of my friends LOVED them    *  Poutine with Oxtail Gravy and Cheddar: Easily one of my        favorites...so flavorful, and who doesn't love french fries covered        in meat?    *  Foie Gras Loco Moco: Umm...hamburger, spam, foie gras and        egg?? Four different types of protein, running the gamut from        crappiest to best? Definitely one of the most unique meat-filled        dishes I've ever tried...and surprisingly pretty darn good!    *  Sticky Toffee Pudding: My friends and I completely loved this        dessert, what with the sweet and the salty; I've talked to        people who like more traditional sticky toffee pudding and this        was not really up their alley, but...they don't count. Go ahead. Get outside your meat-loving comfort zone.

Very unique menu, noisy environment, and a bit overrated. Hamachi tostada was delicious but everything else was ok. Lettuce beets salad had well thought out ingredients. Balsamic pork ribs had too much sauce that over powered the meat taste.

Went here last night for my friend's birthday.  She initially selected another restaurant closer to home, but once we realized that our group would be smaller than expected, she switched it up to Animal.  I agree 100% with those reviewers that say to try not to go in groups larger than 4.  Not only due to space but also because you can comfortably share a dish between 4 people rather than 6 without ordering 2 of everything.  We got a reservation for 6 p.m. and arrived early.  The place doesn't open up til 6 on the dot because valet wasn't set up and the gates were down.  We street parked, waited a few in the car and walked over.  No big deal!  The service was great, hostess sweet and the food was DELICIOUS!  Also based on reviews, we decided to bring our own wine, 2 bottles, $40 total for corkage.  Amongst 4 of us, we got: hamachi - VERY tasty and fresh.  it was clean and definitely helped in balancing out the more heavier dishes kale salad - also tasty, good as a side broccoli - okay, a little salty.  should have gone with 2 orders of kale instead chicken ears - better than i thought and not scary at all!  it was a little too tangy for me, but glad i tried it pork belly sammies - we ordered 2 since only 2 comes out.  it was so yummy!! poutine - first time trying poutine.  also very good since i looove french fries flank steak - good, but not great.  i liked the whipped cheesey thingy. dulce de leche - i LOVED the texture of this dessert.  very very yummy. So overall Animal did NOT disappoint.  I came out full, but not feeling too heavy like I drank a vat of oil.  Our entire bill was roughly $210 total.  This includes all our dishes, corkage, tax and tip!

I love meat and I like trying new foods. The experience I had at Animal was oddly unique, and not to mention deliciously expensive. This place is for those who are feeling a little adventurous with animal parts. It was my boyfriend's birthday and mine shortly follows after! What a treat this was for us. I made a reservation for 8pm Sunday night and had no problem doing so over the telephone. The location is unmarked and a few doors away from Canters. You could easily miss it if you didn't know the address. We arrived thirty minutes early and parked with the one friendly gentleman working valet. Animal was very accommodating and didn't have any problem seating us early, which was awesome! I didn't expect that. The decor is very minimal, and there are just plain old dimly lit bulbs on the wall. I like the ambience of the place. The dress is casual and everyone is laid back, so I don't get that overly pretentious feel from the staff in comparison to when I go visit other high end restaurants. Especially since I never dress up.. for anything. Our server's name was Jeff, and he was on top of everything. He would notify us when our next dish was coming up, and he even recommended a few beers to my boyfriend (one of which that was not in the menu.) Great service from the rest of the staff as well. They would remove plates and give refills so my glass was never empty. Everyone was awesome. We had quite a large order for two, I think we went a little crazy. Like I stated, double birthdays for us! :D Favorites: -Marrow bone: I knew we would both like this so we each ordered our own. I am glad we did because it would have looked like a case of two defensive eating dogs fighting over it. So delicious, you just spread that stuff on the slices of toast that come with it. I love bone marrow and this was excellent because you get a lot of it all at once. -Veal Brain: This is something I have never had before till I tried it at Animal. I couldn't resist making zombie 'braaaiiinns' comments, but I think I know why they eat them now. The texture was so soft like a creamy butter texture and I really liked the seasoning they used with it. Plus, now I can disgust all my friends by saying I ate a brain. -Bbq pork belly sliders: It's pork belly with bbq.. Do I need to say more? we like it so much we had to do two orders of it. The rest of the order included chicken liver toast, pigs ear, pigs head, foie gras loco moco, and foie gras with biscuit and gravy. The only two things I wasn't crazy about were the pigs head, not that it was bad, I just wasn't feeling it compared to everything else. The loco moco wasn't my cup of tea either and I felt it was way too salty for my palette. Still all in all, this was a great visit, even tho it put a huge dent in my wallet. My boyfriend and I loved the food, but this is a place we cannot visit often since it would put us both in the poor house! haha. Special occasions only, which means now I have to find more 'special occasions' to make up.

Our feast consisted of: foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy veal brains, vadouvan, apple sauce, carrot marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw bacon chocolate crunch bar In that exact order. Everything was rolid.  People had warned us to not be pressured into ordering everything at once - to take our time.  However, we did order everything up front and found that the courses were paced perfectly.  Our waiter, James, was very helpful and made sure that we had a great experience.

First great meal of 2011, on the books. Mrs. Q and I are unabashed meatlovers, so the only surprise with us loving Animal is that it took us so long to dine here together. (She'd gone previously with some work friends.) We'd been wanting to see Blue Valentine for a while, so we decided to make it a night in LA by booking a reservation for Animal after the movie. After watching that "depressing piece of shit," what better way to rid ourselves of that movie-induced melancholia than gorging on deliciously prepared meats, right? (By the way, that quote was overheard as we exited the Arclight; I thought it was a great movie personally. Depressing, yes; piece of shit, no.) We had a late reservation, so by the time we rolled into Animal, the place was only half-full. The setting and late hour made the small space even more intimate, as it wasn't overly loud or boisterous. Service was warm and mostly attentive, but let's face it, the focus here is the food - more specifically, the meat, served up in a variety of exotic and interesting ways. By Mrs. Q decree, however, we stayed away from the sweetbreads and veal brains, but we got some uncommon dishes anyway. We started with the hamachi tostada, and the chopped pig ear, which actually complemented each other in a way, as they were both citrusy. I liked the tangy fish vinaigrette and crunch of the tostada with the hamachi, but Mrs. Q was rightly raving about the pig ear. For our heavier dishes, we went with the oxtail poutine and the foie gras loco moco. Let  me tell you, the poutine was delicious, but that loco moco has set the bar pretty high for the rest of 2011. It's gonna be hard to live up to that meal, 'leven. You best bring it.

I sooo wanted to LOVE this place... :( We came for an early-ish dinner on a weekday.  We got seated right away, and immediately noticed how cozy but stark the place was.  Uncovered light bulbs that hung sideways from the wall drew my eyes like a moth to a flame. I'm not sure that I liked that.. it's distracting, as it's kinda bright and I can't keep my eyes from... well let's just say they might need to fix that... The menu looked awesome!!  So excited for marrow bone, because my pregnant self was craving this for some reason.  The waiter comes by  within a reasonable amount of time and we ordered the following-  marrow bone, crispy pig's head, veal sweetbreads, foie gras with biscuit and maple sausage gravy and the poutine with the oxtail gravy. The veal sweetbreads came out first. They were cut into little chunks and fried, cooked well (not chewy) and had a finger lime aioli which I liked a lot.  The finger lime seeds, if you've never had them, are little round balls (think caviar) which, when bitten into, release a very tart, citrusy blast of flavor. It was a great compliment to the rich aioli and cut whatever grease came from the frying of the sweetbreads. The pig's head came out next, in the form of a patty. It surprisingly tasted like corned beef.  I liked it.  So far, so good. Next came the foie gras with the biscuit and  maple gravy. Ugh so many things went wrong here... first, let me just say the foie was cooked perfectly. It was rich and buttery and decadent- such a tragedy that this piece of sexiness was even contemplated to be on the same dish as the other garbage that laid beneath it. The biscuit was dry, and all you tasted was greasy maple syrup. To say that whoever made that dish that night was heavy-handed would be an understatement.  Such a shame!! Here is where things really got bad.  The next dish that was supposed to come out was what we were all waiting for. Two pieces of cut bone came out to us piping hot.  I dig in and spread on the toast and notice it's not really spreading... it's just kinda globby and looked congealed.  So I dug in toward the middle of the bone, and it's pink in the middle... NOT GOOD... We alerted our waiter, and he was quick to apologize and placed another order.  We wait another 15-20 minutes and another order came out. Again, two pieces of bone, piping hot... I took some, and it spread, but when my husband tried to spread his, his was all globby and gross. OK, WTF.  The waiter again acknowledged that this was not right and said maybe we should just order something else or forget about it, since we do have the poutine coming our way in a couple of minutes and that it was a healthy-portioned dish.  We kept a menu around, just in case. The manager of the restaurant came a couple minutes later to check up on us. She apologized, kinda.  She was being nice but  basically said "Congratulations on your pregnancy! Sorry that the bone marrow wasn't  what you were expecting. We just wanted to let you know that we typically do not render out the fat from the bone marrow, and we do serve bone marrow in this way. I could see how this could be of concern to you, would you like to substitute this for another dish?"  I said, "So you're telling me you typically serve raw bone marrow??" And she basically replied "Yes." WHAT, LADY?? I've never heard that before and was pretty much in shock.  At this point, I was done.  We got our poutine and it tasted pretty good, with the exception of bitterness that carried over from the marrow incident. We decided not to order anything else, and left without dessert or another dish. *Sigh* - Probably never coming back.

I had dinner at Animal last week and it was by far the best meal I've had in 7 years of living in Los Angeles.   Between the poutine, the calf brains, the yellowtail collar, the sweat breads and pork belly sliders it was delicious and decadent.  I highly recommend this place for people who want delicious food that is made by some very creative chefs. Fantastic!

Our waiter looked like Jude Law. Only a better looking, less pretentious version of Jude Law. Eye candy check. My friend was secretly taking photos of him while pretending to observe the restaurant. I have to say though Animal can do no wrong in my eyes. Absolutely nothing. The service was impeccable, the food came out promptly and everything was brilliant. Add a bottle of wine and great company in the mix and you have yourself a fantastic night. Because it was a group of five of us, we were able to order heaps to try a little bit of everything. My standouts out of the ohhhhh.... eleven or so items we chose were: 1. Hamachi Tostada Succulent slices of hamachi stacked carefully  with a mountain of lettuce, red onions, crispy onion rings - great way to whet your appetite. 2. Bone Marrow Who doesn't love bone marrow here raise your hand? Because I will take it from you in a heartbeat. The bone marrow at Animal was gigantic and gooey and perfect slathered on a piece of toast. 3. Poutine with oxtail gravy. One thing Canadians got right - how to eat your fries. Slathered in oxtail gravy and oozing with cheese, it is a dieter's nightmare but a foodie's wet gravy dream. I can eat a plateful, nay, two platefuls if given the chance. 4. Foie gras loco moco. I love foie gras. I love loco moco. A match made in culinary heaven. The richness of the foie gras went so well with the unpretentious loco moco I'm salivating just thinking about it. The only thing that makes me sad is that I had no room for dessert. I wasn't even wearing pants so I didn't get the satisfaction of unbuttoning the top button after an outstanding meal. Next time Animal, you sexy beast you.

There's no doubt that Animal has imaginative cuisine. This small, intimate restaurant was the perfect place to come for a girl's night out. We were a party of 4 and as some of the other reviewers recommend, keep in mind that the food portions are more like tapas dishes. Our waiter recommended 8 - 10 dishes for a group of 4. I'd say 9 would have been the perfect number if you include dessert. 10 was more than enough to tip the scale. Top 3 picks: (1) Pork belly sandwiches: I had a "ratatouille" moment the minute I bit into this delicious tasting slider. One order only gives you two sliders, but because of the amount of other dishes we had, we decided we'd just half each sandwich to share among the 4 of us. To be honest, I wish each person got one slider each, because this was a blast of happy in my mouth. I'll never forget it. (2) Foie gras loco moco: Given how unhealthy foie gras is for you, I definitely think having only one foie gras dish is more than enough. (Animal has at least three different foie gras dish options, so choose wisely!) The taste alone sends signals to the pleasure centers of your brain.You'll be breathing out your nose since your mouth will probably be too busy chewing and savoring every flavor. (3) Oxtail poutine: Though this seems to be a common dish in gastropubs and isn't too unique, I was quite impressed with how well the oxtail was cooked. I often think that outside Asian cuisine, oxtail couldn't possibly be done with skill in a New American restaurant, but I was wrong. The oxtail has just the right consistency and goes well with the french fries. Recommended veggie dishes: There's a lot of meat on the menu, so be sure to use the few vegetable dishes on the menu as a nice palate cleanser and appetizer. The waiter definitely did a great job with bringing out the food in a logical order. He brought out all our vegetable dishes first before serving the heavy-hitters. (1) Baby kale, pecorino, lemon chili vinaigrette, crouton: This dish surprised all of us. It's basically very crispy (perhaps fried) kale. Not only nutritious, but delicious. (2) Lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac: Not anything special, but a nice chunk of vegetable to get into the diet before your meat-centered journey. (3) Hamachi tostada: You barely taste the hamachi, but I thought this was a very innovative spin on the tostada concept. It felt like more of a salad dish and had a very light taste. Other yummy meat dishes: (1) Balsamic pork ribs: My friend loved these, I thought they were good but not stellar. I definitely think you could find a BBQ specialty restaurant who could do it better. (2) Crispy rabbit legs: This one got mixed reviews from the table. It tasted more like fish n' chips than rabbit. (3) Thai BBQ quail: The quail is small and perfect as an appetizer. It was very flavorful and a worthy addition to our order. Dessert: We tried the famed bacon chocolate crunch bar. As my friend so aptly said, "It challenges the mouth." I don't think it qualifies as the best thing I ever ate (I think that was a gross overstatement made by whoever said that on the Food Network) but it's worth trying once. The bacon is fried and used as the "crunch" consistency, but you can't really taste it. The chocolate was good, but nothing I couldn't find at a bakery. The dish is overrated so don't come in with high expectations. I think the salt and pepper ice cream was more interesting than the crunch bar itself. Be sure to make reservations ahead of time before you try this place out! The restaurant fills up quickly particularly on weekend nights.

Three can be a good number.  Just ask Britney Spears.  That was the case with our recent visit (#3) to Animal, hence the shiny new 5-star rating. Between me, the hubs and the bro, the three of us killed 8 plates of food and were still able to walk away without any injuries. And now for the food recap: Liver toast ($3) Poutine fries ($15) oxtail gravy, cheddar Bone marrow ($10) chimichurri, caramelized onions BBQ pork belly sliders ($12) Hamachi tostada ($14) fish sauce vinaigrette, peanuts Balsamic pork ribs ($16) squash, arugula, pecans Melted petit basque ($12) chorizo, grilled bread Grilled octopus ($17) chorizo, chowchow Best dishes of the night include the rich, buttery bone marrow with the sharp cutting chimichurri.. hands-down one of the best versions of marrow I've ever had.  Second was the hamachi tostada which was perfect in every way.  The melted petit basque is sinful, piping hot, amazing cheese-gasm goodness. And although the pig ear was sold out, it's still one of my favorites on the menu. Service was great... special thanks to our waitress for ignoring the penis my husband and brother crafted out of the rib bones.

I had been looking forward to going here for some time, just needed the right person to drag along.  Absolutely loved the food and the simplicity of the atmosphere.  Not much more to add to this review other than I ate too much dinner... and didn't save room for the bacon chocolate crunch bar!   Will definitely be making another trip out there to enjoy again, well worth the drive.

Wait. Have I really not Yelped Animal? Weird. Let me put it this way: I've had every thing on the menu. The entire staff knows my name. They know my choice of wine. They know my palate. I no longer need a menu. One of the few non Japanese places I can return to repeatedly - as in, weekly - and leave satisfied. Enough said.

Animal is such an appropriate name for this restaurant. Trying to find this place made me feel like a lioness on the hunt for a gazelle. After dinner, I felt like one of those overly satisfied carnivores walking out of there after scarfing down juicy, fatty, meaty portions of my prey. ------------- Locale: To find this restaurant is a little difficult since the restaurant name isn't on the outside. So just look for the signs for the burger place next door. My friend and I had to drive around a couple of times to figure out the restaurant's location. FYI, Animal is located in a section of town that...how do I say it, isn't so great. ------------- Parking: Parking isn't great either but there's valet! There's a super nice valet guy who will take care of your car. Don't waste your time trying to find street parking. There isn't much and if you can find it, it's a little further down the block. ------------- Ambiance/decor: Okay so the decor is a bit sparse, borderline spartan. Picture bare walls with wood trim, lighting from naked bulbs along the walls and wood tables and chairs. There is one framed picture at the far end of one wall but I couldn't see what it was. The ambiance was very comfortable though. They had music playing and there was chatter from the waitstaff and the customers. ------------- Dining experience: 1st dish - Grilled octopus, chorizo, spicy brown mustard, chowchow When I saw chowchow, I immediately thought of the dog. But they can't really have dog on the menu, can they? Hmmmm....so I did a quick wikipedia look up and I found out that chowchow is actually a pickled relish made of a mix of vegetables. Whew! This dish was so good. I love octopus and I loved how this dish made the octopus taste like the grilled ones I got from the street vendors in Japan. So delish. The chowchow is a really good complement to the smoky flavor of the octopus and the chorizo. 2nd dish - BBQ pork belly sliders with coleslaw Seeing the gobs of fat peeking out from under the coleslaw, it was with only a little bit of hesitation before I picked up the slider and took a bite. Although I hadn't tried the last dish yet, my stomach and I already knew that this was probably the standout dish of the night. The slaw was great, a simple mixture of chopped cabbage and some kind of mustard and mayo "dressing." The pork belly was crispy and reminded me of chicharrones. It wasn't all fat though. There was some very tender juicy belly meat as well. The buttery slider rolls were an excellent match for this maybe not so healthy but oh so yummy dish. 3rd dish - Balsamic pork ribs, delicata squash, arugula, pecans After the 2nd dish, this one was a little bit of a let down. I did like the side salad of arugula, squash and pecans since it was something light. The rib meat was, as my friend said, "fall off the bone" meat; which was an accurate observation since that meat just fell off the bone, onto my fork and right into my mouth. It was tender, juicy, but there wasn't a lot of fat. I think I was full from the 2nd dish though so eating this dish was a bit of a chore. Dessert - Bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise Wow...I was seriously stuffed after those three dishes but this dessert was recommended so my friend and I decided to get this. When the waiter brought it out, I thought to myself "Those look like kit-kat bars" but these were definitely nothing like a kit-kat bar. It was a very good end to our meal. I could taste a bit of the saltiness of the bacon bits and the chocolate was cool and nice and rich and balanced out the bacon well. This dessert is a definite must try. Tip: Make sure to share these dishes so you can try several of them. The portions are small but very shareable. ------------- Service: Exceptional. The waitstaff all worked together as a team and they were very friendly and helpful. They made sure to check in with us every so often; not too often so we'd feel rushed or too little so we'd feel abandoned. ------------- Bottom line: If you like meat, you have to try this restaurant. Great service, very good food, comfortable ambiance...what more can you ask for?

animal. the sister resto of son of a gun. the meat version. probably the closest restaurant that is set up like new york. and i love it. a little nyc in the little la. except la is big, and is quickly catching up! if la could only keep on on the dining scene, i'd probably stay forever. had the bone marrow with chimichurri and carmelized onions and toast. the toast is a little thick for my liking, but i loved the dish nonetheless. best bone marrow in la, methinks. :) the tandoori octopus with tamarind, kumquat and raita was perfectly cooked. lovely consistency. bbq pork belly sandwiches were great the machi tostada was not the highlight, but it certainly was refreshing. got the grilled quail with plum char-siu, apple, pear and yogurt. i love quail in any way shape and form so it was a delight to have this! as far as dessert, got 3 of them: berries vanilla custard lavender crumble & sticky toffee pudding w/ mascapone and orange, and finally the bacon chocolate crunch bar with salt and pepper ice cream. the s&p ice cream with bacon bar was good, but not the winner. the sticky toffee pudding was great, wish it was a big crunchier, while the berries sang. i love the constantly changing menu and can't wait for my next visit!

If you love to eat meat, you have to pay this place a visit.  They serve just about every strange part of Pork that I've never had the fortune of trying.  Pig ears, pork belly, hog head, pigs tail, the list just goes on and on. The foie gras with maple sausage and biscuit . . . .  RIDICULOUS!  I'm having obscene  thoughts of that bastard right now.  The Pork Belly sliders were unforgettable as well.  The pigs tail was incredibly heavy and fatty, so I'm staying away from that one next time, but overall most of the selections were on-point. Pretty nice wine selection also.  Did I mention the Chocolate-bacon bar for desert? Check it out.

What can I say, Animal has really raised the bar for me  this weekend. We arrived around 8pm on Saturday without reservation and had to wait about an hour for a set at the bar. ( Make sure you make reservations !)Yes, we did think about leaving but the wait was so worth it! First arrived yellowtail collar, collard green kimchi, chili soy. It was absolutely divine. The unexpected combination of the sauce and fish was very interesting Second was  barbeque pork belly sandwiches. Mmm absolutely delicious. They serve 2 sandwiches on the plate and everybody orders this dish!You probably don't want to look inside of the slider, just enjoy the moment! Third was Rock Cod It was definitely an interesting combination but Yellowtale was better And forth dish was AMAZING foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger. We finished our dinner with Tres leches which was very good and sticky toffee pudding. I think beer selection and wine could be better, both wine and beer was too bitter... The bill was $120 without tip The experience was amazing, you could even say life changing becasue you will see food from a complete different prospective! Will be back!

Fun and funky little restaurant with unique menu items.  Most of the food is stellar, but their desserts leave much to be desired.  The portions are small (especially for the price, eeeshhh...), so make sure to order at least 3 plates/person.  Also, their house cabernet is pretty great for $20/bottle.   Chicken Liver Toast - gooooooood.  very smooth and not too livery, which i prefer.  the onion marmalade is a great complement.   Hamachi Tostada - very light and refreshing, with great citrus flavors Foie Gras Biscuit w/ Maple Sausage Gravy - OMFG.  my favorite thing on the menu, and this is coming from an anti-foie gras person.  this is a must try.  the flavors are amazing together. Foie Gras Loco Moco - very meh.  too salty.  the other flavors overwhelmed the delicate foie gras so i really felt like it was wasted on this dish.   BBQ Pork Belly Sliders - amazing.  the pork belly was so tender with just the perfect hint of smokiness and the bun is perfectly toasty and warm.   Bone Marrow - very good, but the chimichurri sauce is a little bit aggressive in that its hard to taste the marrow under it. Thai BBQ Quail - very very good, but pricey for an itty bitty portion.  its pretty hard to cook quail, but ours was perfectly done so it was moist and amazing. Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar - the salt and pepper ice cream is good, but the bacon bar is pretty whatevs. Sticky Toffee Pudding - i had one bite and stopped eating.  the pudding was dense, doughy, and had no flavor.  SKIP. Tres Leches Cake - not bad, but unimpressed. Buffalo-style Pig Tails - surprisingly good!  pig tails have a kind of gelatinous quality to them...almost like tendon.  the buffalo-style presentation was a smart way of making a somewhat wonk ingredient more palatable. Crispy Pig Ears w/ Chili Lime Sauce - delicious.  the pig ears really worked well with the sauce.  it was light and just subtley spicy.   Crispy Pig's Head - not bad, but not fantastic.  it really wasn't anything special. Poutine w/ Ox Tail Gravy - YUM.  fries?  love.  gravy?  love.  ox tail?  love.  cheese?  LOVE. Potato Agnolotti with Rabbit Sausage - this was really really good, but i can see how it could be a bit on the buttery side.  the thumper sausage was deeeelicious though.

Ok this place is cool.  its a small basically unmarked store front on Fairfax close to Canters deli.  The menu is very eclectic and the flavors are very intersting.  This is the kind of place you go once and say wow that was neat they have Pig Ear buffalo wings (no trafe here but hey got give them credit for creativity). But you probably dont go back unless your taking a group of friends because it is a bit funky.  The best part of the night was that after having a enjoyable meal I walked into Canters to get some Rugalach and smelled the pastrami and thought to myself while that place is good and funky nothing beats pastrami on rye.

A trendy hollywood/LA attraction... Don't see all the hype my culinary professional peers see. The food is good... But short of amazing or visionary. Menu left me looking for more. Pricey for portion sizes. Service was average... No bar, beer and wine only. I can't remember the last time I had beer out of a can, well I had two here. 6:30 reservation and was seated promptly. I think this is a trendy LA spot... The food falls flat though. Again good, but nothing that wowed me. The pork belly BBQ sandwiches, too much sauce and the slaw to "dressed". The ribs seemed boiled or steamed which is a cardinal sin in my book. No fire or smoke in them. For the those who seek to be seen and go to the "in" spots... This may be for you. For people who love amazing food, I'd look elsewhere, unless you enjoy paying premium for small portions of average food.

One of the rare occasions (at least for me) where I was not disappointed with any dishes during the course of a meal, even with the high expectations I held for this place coming in. Maybe I don't eat out enough, but hey, bite me. (rawr) If there was some way to consume bite after bite of what tastes like pure butter in your mouth, and thoroughly enjoy it, well this is it. Every dish we ordered turned out to be incredibly savory, starting with the ohmygod pork belly sandwiches and its isweartogod tender pork chunks. I couldn't tell if they removed all the actual meat from the pork, or if they miraculously cooked the pork to such perfection that every bite was moist to perfection. At just the right temperature, paired with the cold tangy coleslaw, it was simply delectable. Next dish was the pork head, and to my (and my roommate's) disappointment, it came out as a slice. We were seriously expecting to fork at a baby pig's head at the shock of the other diners, but Animal threw us a curveball. Nevertheless, our disappointment quickly dissipated as we took the first bites. Again, nothing short of perfectly cooked pork. Each bite was as moist and soft as it could get, paired with a healthy heaping of tartar sauce and a myriad of pickled vegetables. Another fabulous dish. Then of course came the foie gras hamburger, which just put a smile on my face with each bite, and right now, as i reminisce of the explosion of flavors that came with the spoonful of hamburger, spam, rice(or was it risotto?) and essence of foie gras. Need I say more? Just read the other reviews. At this point we still felt a little room in our stomach, so we decided to throw on an order of rabbit leg, which turned out to be a stupid idea on our part because as soon as it arrived, everything in our stomach settled, and i really was not feeling rabbit legs anymore. Not wanting to waste food, we basically stuffed it down. I regret to say I was not thinking of how it tasted, and thus cannot give it a fair description. Well, I'm tired of writing, and I'm sure you're tired of reading, so I'll make it quick. Bacon covered chocolate. Delicious paired with ice cream. Definitely interesting. Worth trying. Just. do. it.

I came here with reservations on a Tuesday night, which was a good thing because the place was crowded, and there was a wait. First and foremost, to the ladyfolk out there, the air conditioning is pumped up full blast at the front of the restaurant, and things get progressively warmer as you head to the back. I'm a guy and frequently I'm hot, however that night... I was freezing. Drinks... excellent selection of wines, and for the most part, they're all by the glass as well. This is awesome for mixing and matching. And the food, we started with the marrow bone with chimichurri which was in a word, awesome. It truly was. Next up was the pork belly sandwiches, which are two delectable sliders. They were pretty damn good, but.. were they good because the marrow bone just started to whet my appetite and I was starving at this point? I won't know till I go again. Then we had the veal brains (mad cow!), which was ok. It wasn't "oh-my-*deity of your choice*" great. Other "brains" I've had, usually it's cooked up so the outer part is crispy, and the inner is nice and soft. This was ok. Last main dish was the foie gras biscuit. This I'll say was pretty good. It was also pretty obese. I love foie gras, so this was a must have. The savory and sweet was a good combo, but honestly, if this dish was any bigger, or I didn't have someone to share with, there's no way I'd be able to finish it. Then for dessert, like everyone seems to say was the bacon chocolate crunch bar. Bacon and chocolate... eh... it's been done before. I wasn't really a fan. In all likelihood, I won't be coming back. It was good, but not really worth a repeat now that I know what it's all about. But, go ahead give it a whirl at least once.

- a multicellular organism of the kingdom Animalia, differing from plants in certain typical characteristics such as capacity for locomotion, nonphotosynthetic metabolism, pronounced response to stimuli, restricted growth, and fixed bodily structure. - a person who behaves in a bestial or brutish manner. - a person having a specified aptitude or set of interests. - a person who is wild in bed It is safe to say that this place is all that, and all in a good way. It is rare to find a place that caters to such a crowd that dishes out plates upon plates of animal parts they would not normally consume elsewhere.  But here, they share and eat in complete abandon pig's ears and veal brain. Next thing you know, they'll be serving slow-roasted pig's head - crunchy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside.  Let's see if they can suck on those eyes or slurp on that brain. Speaking of which, why is it that sex and food trigger the same pleasure button in our brain? Well, it goes to show that in case you're not getting any, you can always opt to eat great food. And this place is a good bet. Try the pulled pork sandwich,  you might mistake this as 2minute blowjob. They may not be animals in the bedroom, but I'm sure a couple of them are in the kitchen. And I don't mind that at all. And if you're one of the lucky few who has a date and does know and get great  food, be sure to have the bacon chocolate and cap the night by inviting him or her to 'come up for coffee', of course, while this is being played in the background: http://www.youtube.com/w… Then you just might be called like one in bed.

After reading reviews for years and lusting over the countless food porn articles about the place I finally made a reservation and battled my way up Fairfax to the food mecca known as Animal. First off, props to the staff there. Every staff person I had contact with was cheery, helpful and eager to take care of us. As for the food, I kind of thought of the food here like the most amazing one night stand ever. You have a really amazing experience that will linger forever in your memory but you know it's bad for you but if you get the chance you'll do it again. Here's what I had and what I dug about it. We started with the pig ear, lime, fried egg. Loved that they julienned the ear. It allowed it to fry up nice and crispy to a chicharonne like crunchiness and really take on the lime and seasonings. At first bite I kind of thought the egg wasn't needed but after a little contemplation I realized that the dish really needed it to balance out the acidity of the lime which could have ended up being a bit overwhelming. Solid dish, well thought out. Next we did the BBQ pork belly sandwiches w/ slaw. F#*K me these were good! The soft, unctuous pork belly bathed in barbecue sauce went perfectly with the slaw. Love at first bite, lust every bite after. Following that was the poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar. I need to find out where they get their white cheddar! Sharp melty love over a dark glistening gravy over pommes frite! My inner 3 am drunk was singing at the top of his lungs with joy! This dish hits all of my most base food urges. Crunchy cheesy savory meaty gravy love all in one dish! So bad yet sooooo good! After that it was the coconut sweetbreads, riata, mango, tamarind. This was the only dish that I wasn't totally in on. The sauces were nice and the sweetbreads had a really lovely crispy fried exterior and the dish looked great but I think because of the other dishes we were having were so rich and big on the pallet it might have fared better had we ordered it first being that it was a much lighter flavor profile. I'll have to give it another shot next time earlier in the line up. The most amazing dish came last and was a perfect topper. Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy. When it came I was happy to see a very nice sized piece of foie perched atop of a fluffy biscuit that had been covered in gravy. Hello lover! From the first bite I knew I would go home dream about this dish and wake up in the morning thinking about it! Seriously this is the best foie dish I've had yet. I've had prettier, more sophisticated ( kitchen 1540 in Solana beach does a great seared foie served on a 400 degree beach stone placed on a bed of thyme to give it a really great aromatic kick. Fancy.) But damn! The combination of the foie gras with the sweet maple gravy and biscuit was a revelation to my taste buds, a new watermark for what my mouth tells my brain is delicious. We finished off the eve with the berries, vanilla custard, lavender crumble, opal basil. Nice, lite, the lavender crumble was kind of a biscotti cookie chunks that were very nice but a bit large and very hard to break down in to bite sized pieces. I'd love to have them with some earl grey in the morning. Nice but the pieces needed to be broken down quite a bit more. So go if you haven't been yet. Go back if you have, you know you want to. There are quite a few things I still need to try. ( Hello crispy pigs head, crispy rabbit, veal brain, balsamic pork ribs!) Just know you'll be doing crunches and cardio for weeks after to pay for your dietary sins at Animal. Every one you of which you will enjoy to the fullest. Cheers loves.

Yum nom nom NOM NOM NOM nom om ooph. This describes my personal arc of hunger (followed by chicken liver toast), consumption (followed by numerous meaty delights and red wine), and finally satiation and extra bit of happiness finally provided by dessert at Animal. This place is DELICIOUS and even kindled in me a latent love for liver, which had been somewhat depressed after living in Fiji for months where liver is served boiled in a pile of other animal parts, roughly chopped into equally sized chunks. Luckily, there is more than one way to prepare and eat all parts of the animal. The only downside? The seating is quite tight, as the place is very small -- even on a Tuesday night it was completely packed from 7pm through the last seating. We had 8 people stuffed into what probably should have been seating for 4. I still suggest going with a large group of people, however, ordering many dishes and trying them all. But then, I am a curious omnivore and want to taste everything. This is a plus at a place like Animal, where everything is great.

I love guts. I love brains, I love the small component parts of animals. I love them in a taco and I love them perfectly presented on a small plate. Animal does just that takes pigs ears and makes them crispy and then serves them with a wonderful flavorsome innovative combo. All the dishes had their own personality and character. Complex flavors unique to each dish. We had: Crispy pig ears - amazing Fois gras with maple biscuit - very rich, geat to share Sweetbreads - served with raita very good flovors Halibut - my daughter loved this Poutine with oxtail gravy n cheddar - Coming back for this as a lunch Crispy egg with asparagus - so good. Hanger steak with truffle fondue - rich and decadent, very good Crispy pigs head - pass next time, tasted like corne beef, could have done without the breading Bacon chocolate - so good, should have been bigger salt and pepper ice cream...... What I like about this place is the vibe, not pretentious, not to cool, just come in and experiment with some foodstuff you might not find at Ralphs. Staff was attentive and friendly, clientele was eclectic and into the experience. Big fan. Now off to try their fish restaurant.

This place is great! It's so new and refreshing to try something completely different. First definetely make a reservation! It's a must! I also have to say I liked their appetizers more than their entrees. I tried a couple of entrees including the maple gravy syrup...ehhh not the best (actually my best friend thought it was way tooo sweet). ENJOY!

It was a stormy and wet Saturday night, as we made our way to LA to sample the cuisine at this much talked about eatery. Despite calling and pushing our reservations back multiple times, we ended up over an hour late! As we walked into the restaurant with our clothes and our spirits soaked from the rain, we immediately noticed the place was packed to capacity!  With only one table remaining, we were pretty sure we'd be turned away.  With a stroke of luck and the graciousness of our hostess, we were actually seated. Woohoo! We were given our paper menus, which listed all of the dishes for the night.  There were so many interesting and enticing offerings, we weren't quite sure what to order.  We started with a couple glasses of wine as we perused the menu. Although everything looked irresistible, we settled with what our trusty Yelpers recommended: Pig Ear, Chili, Lime, Fried Egg - This eclectic dish was crisp, light and very well seasoned (much like fried onions!) I really enjoyed the Thai influence in this dish with the tart and tangy chili lime dressing! It had my lips puckering but my taste buds beggin' for more! The dressing not only added a nice kick to the dish, it also added a good amount of acidity to balance out the rustic and earthy flavors of the pig ears. The warm, gooey yolk from the fried egg rounded out the flavors of this dish nicely! Marrow Bone, Chimichurri, Carmelized Onions - Wow, this dish was phenomenal! My first impression of marrow bone was..."hey, we use this to make Pho broth, then we throw it out, right?"  Boy, am i glad we didn't throw this one out! The marrow, coupled with the caramelized onions, was fluffy, creamy and smooth like Foie Gras.  I spread it on my bread like soft butter! The tangy chimichurri sauce had my mouth watering.  It was full of bright flavors and livened up the dish beautifully!  Seconds anyone?! We also went with some of our waiter's suggestions: Hamachi Tostada - With citrusy flavors and loads of fresh shredded cabbage, it tasted a lot like Vietnamese Goi (Salad) mixed with Peruvian Ceviche (thick cuts of lemon cooked fish served atop a crunchy corn tostada) Now that's street flavor with an awesome twist! Bacon Wrapped Rabbit Loin, Walnuts, Parsnip, Cranberry  - This tasted like a whimsical play on Thanksgiving dinner! The bacon wrapped rabbit did not taste gamey at all. In fact, it tasted a lot like turkey!  The crisp bacon sealed in the flavors and kept the meat moist and tender.  The parsnip tasted like creamy mash and the walnuts added some nice texture to the dish. Again, I loved the creativity and the tongue-in cheek play on a holiday classic! Finally, we had the much anticipated Foie Gras Loco Moco, Quail Egg, Spam, Hamburger - Served atop seasoned rice, this play on a Hawaiian favorite was flavorful, earthy and very satisfying! The foie gras, spam and egg gave the burger so much richness and buttery texture, it melted in my mouth! It was soooo good! The seasoned rice with Srichacha added a nice balance to the dish and, as a whole, all the individual flavors and textures were very harmonious! This dish was definitely a winner in my book! For dessert, we indulged in the Bacon Chocolate crunch bar...YUM! The bacon added just the right amount of saltiness and crunch to the rich and creamy chocolate. This is a must! Overall, I found the food quite innovative, inspiring and a joy to eat! Despite the small servings, nothing here was lacking in flavor! In fact, the flavors had my taste buds dancing and the anticipation of the next plate had my knees knocking!  I haven't been this excited about food in a long time, and I must say, it was refreshing to see my meal prepared in new and exciting ways. I also loved the space. It was pleasantly simple and modern yet incredibly charming with classic decorative details.  The crowd was vibrant and the wait staff was attentive, helpful and friendly! Here's to having FUN at dinner again! Cheers Animal, to a job well done! Happy Eats!

This was my second time at Animal and I loved it once again.   Among my favorite dishes were the Hamachi Tostada, Pork Belly Sliders Pork Ribs, and the Toffee Sticky Cake, which = HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH. The wine our server recommended was good, not great, but that's about the only negative thing I can say about this place.  Oh, and Emma Stone was eating here too - celebrity certified, so you know it's good.

Long story short: For those of you who REALLY know me, you know this is my kind of place.  How can you go wrong with a restaurant named after a food we eat? Long story long: FINALLY!!!  I finally got to try the restaurant named after my favorite food group.  I'm a meatatarian... it's a life choice I came here with my friend Stephanie, who probably loves food and to eat as much if not more than me, so she was the perfect dining companion.  I picked her up and we made our way to the restaurant.  As a lot of people have mentioned, this restaurant is not very large.  Seating maybe about 50-60 people.  The setting is a little casual, but also a little intimate.  A good place to have dinner with a couple of friends, to celebrate a birthday, or to bring a date.  Yes, I've probably said that about a lot of places, but I feel like I've got a pretty good sense about these kind of things.  Plus I wouldn't mention it if I didn't feel that way. We sat down and were given menus.  Our server (who I have since forgot his name) came by and was really nice and was patient as Stephanie and I decided what to get.  It would have been nice to get one of everything, but I wasn't ready to drop a ton of cash for this meal, plus that probably would have been too much food for the 2 of us. We both started with a glass of 2009 Ebling "Alva" Matthias Dosert white wine.  That was quite delicious and slightly fruity and not too crisp We eventually decided on 5 dishes. We started with the chicken liver toast.  This was really good, with an onion jam on a big piece of toast.  I'm usually not one for offal meat, but chicken liver is one of the few exceptions.  Next we had the burrata with raymundo's tomatillo salsa.  This was really good as well.  I LOVE burrata cheese.  Burrata on its own is rather bland, but its wonderfully creamy and the tomatillo salsa was the perfect addition of saltiness, acidity, and flavor. We moved on to the marrow bone with chimichurri sauce and caramelized onions.  Now, who DOESN'T love bone marrow?  Ok, I maybe know one or two people, but all I can say is they're just missing out.  I mean... bone marrow!!  This marrow was really good.  The bone was sliced length wise, give us more marrow.  The chimichurri and caramelized onions gave a nice good balance to the rich, delicious marrow.  I probably could have just eaten this the entire night and I would have been more than happy. Next up, and what was arguably my favorite dish of the night, and with good reason, was the barbeque pork belly sliders.  *cleaning out ears* Pork belly?  BBQ? Pork belly?  Ok someone get me a bunch of napkins to wipe up all this drool on my keyboard.  Even 5 months later, I still dream and think of those sliders.  The pork belly was perfect and was served with a wonderful crunchy cole slaw and a little bit of BBQ sauce on a soft bun. We finished the savory dishes with the sweetbreads, creamed spinach, capers and oyster mushrooms.  Sweetbreads are also one of the few exceptions I make in terms of offal meats.  But then again, are sweetbreads even considered offal meat?  I believe so *googling*... ok thought so.  The creamed spinach, capers, and oyster mushrooms added good balance to the dish. At this point, while we were more than satisfied and getting full, and though we didn't need to, we both loved the BBQ pork belly sliders so much, that we decided to get a 2nd order.  Yes, it was THAT good. We had struck up conversation with our server and through conversation I had mentioned I was in the industry and working in pastries.  We then ordered the infamous bacon chocolate bar for dessert.  When that came out, a piece of the tres leches cake came out as well.  That was actually confusing but our server soon came by and told us he sent it out on him.  How nice is that?  Yes, he got bonus points (aka bigger tip) for that. The tres leches cake wasn't too bad, but I haven't had many tres leches cakes, so I'm not totally sure what makes a good tres leches and what makes a bad tres leches.  The bacon chocolate bar was ok.  Stephanie and I both agreed it actually was probably a little overrated.  I mean, we still enjoyed it, but it wasn't knock your socks off and send you to heaven of degustational bliss good. But overall we both enjoyed the meal and agreed we would come back in a heartbeat.  Yes, it's been almost 5 months since we've gone, but I'm waiting for the opportunity to go back!!!

And for my 260th review, I present to you ANIMAL. I could state the obvious and tell you about how trendy this place is or how consuming a few of the small plates could easily anger your cardiologist but I'll refrain.  (see what I did there?) Instead, I'll give you my first giggle of an impression of the signless restaurant front. I walk into the bathroom, whose walls are lined with mirrors of all different shapes-n-sizes, reminiscent to me of the portraits in Disneyland's haunted mansion.  I half expected one to be a "fun" mirror that would contort my face into some elephant woman. I turn to see those incense bathroom sticks and immediately I hear Aziz Ansari say, "...Pick up one of those bottles we can put sticks in to make the room smell like vanilla bean. I've been fartin' all day it smells like shit in here."   Alright, alright.  We're off to a good start. .DRINKS. I arrive back to my table and am not intimidated by their unique menu offerings, but rather the wine list.  It's the furthest from domestic, prices ranging from $42/bottle to $375.  I know you guys are trying - but we DO live in California... and it's kiiiinda known for it's wine.  Maybe a few options?  Should you bring your own wine - there's a $20 corkage fee. Instead I opt for the Old Jubilation Ale which I thought tasted similar to a Chimay but creamier. After nudging our server for his opinion of the ale, we got , "It's like a Puerto Rican tranny on heroin."  At 8.3% avl on a bottle that's boasts "Ho,Ho, Whoa!" on the bottom of the label, I'm glad it was served in thin, tall shot glasses to enjoy.   .MUSIC. The music played is eclectic and AMAZING. Any restaurant that plays Primus followed by Outkast can stay. .ANIMALS. If you don't have an adventurous palate or bone in your body - go away or the menu will taunt you a second time.  (Monty Python anyone?) We were told to select about 4 small plates to share between us... only we opted for 5.  And lord knows if I had more room I would've chosen a few more.  There were SO many delectable sounding options on the menu. Our selections were served in this order: HAMACHI tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut $14 Great start to the meal. Light, yet flavorful.  The fish sauce vinaigrette was anything but fishy.  Julienne cabbage and serrano peppers, just a little bit of pureed avocado, cilantro, and just a few toasted peanuts with fresh hamachi.  I could've eaten a few orders of these and been happy. MARROW BONE, chimichurri, caramelized onions $10 If it weren't for being a fan of oso bucco, I'd likely be to afraid to consume marrow.   Combined with the chimichurri, carmelized onions and 2 pieces of more or less Texas toast which was sorta sweet, the marrow was de-licious.  Presented on a few inches of a narrow hollowed bone, there was a good amount of this delectable concoction to share between two people. PIG EAR, chili, lime, fried egg $12 I told you not to be scared. This little treat is thinly sliced and fried, doused with a chili and lime sauce and served underneath a fried egg.  Between the flavor and the crunchy texture I was an extremely happy diner. BBQ PORK BELLY sandwiches, slaw $12 Pork belly is amazing because a) it's like 90% fat and b) it comes from pig.  Pig is by FAR my favorite animal and as far as I'm concerned can do no wrong.  The 2 sliders that came out were fantastic. POUTINE, oxtail gravy, cheddar $15 Yeah - cheese curds doesn't sound appealing to me either.  Nor does a dish that is pronounced pooh-tin.  Nonetheless, I tried it.  Much to my delight it was awesome.  Imagine pot roast served over french fries.   .SWEET THINGS. BACON chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise $7 Not exactly what I was expecting - but definitely good.  If you like chocolate, and I don't, I like bacon, you'll likely love it.  There's not much bacon to it - but the crunch that's there coupled with the salty factor makes this dessert scrumptious. TRES LECHES , dulce de leche Upon our server James' recommendation we ordered the tres leches. Omg. Take this lactose intolerant girl to the back for slaughter. I can die a happy woman. I'm not going to describe it, just order it. It's the perfect light finish after your meal. .AND IF I HAD MY WAY. I would've also tried: Fried salt and pepper boston sweet shrimp , remoulade Rabbit loin, cranberry, benton's bacon, parnsip, pistacchio Thai BBQ quail, scallion, pink turnip, yogurt Rabbit legs, potato puree, mustard, bacon, green beans, chanterelles and hell, maybe even the veal brains, vadouvan, apple sauce, carrot Do make a reservation.  Do come here with an open mind.  Do enjoy. I know I did.

Our experience here was good.  It's what we expected.  A menu filled with funky stuff that we search for all in one place.  Their selection is good.  That said, I thought the seasoning/sauce for some of the dishes masked the actual taste of the food too much.  In particular, their signature foie gras bisket.  The gravy and bisket were too overpowering.  When I ate the foie gras by itself, the taste was spectacular.  Another example is the pig tail, which they made with buffalo sauce.  Although the idea is good, the sauce is all you can taste.  The calf brains, however, was seasoned perfectly. I also enjoyed the bacon chocolate bar with pepper ice cream.  The tres leches was awesome.

Review 909.  Surprised this place is rated so high.   Came here on a thursday night with a group of girls.  We made a reservation and my friend had to put down a credit card.  They called 3 times to confirm the reservation.  They insisted that we arrive on time or they would cancel the reservation.   We get there on time, but our table was not ready.  So we waited 30 minutes for the table.  Really???   Service was slow.  One waiter for like a thrid of the restaurant.  He came by peridically.  The radiccio salad was good, alsong with the foie gras.  The melting cheese thing was good too.  The balasimic glazed short ribs where okay.  About half the courses were good.   We ordered the tres leches for dessert.  It was overwhelming sweet.  We could hardly eat it.  Then we found a hair on it.  We were done.   Don't know if I would come back.  Ya, it's all food and shit, but it's all hyped up like Father's Office.

I got a chance to eat here with my GF on Saturday night.  I had heard great things about this place and since she and I love small plates, the decision was simple. The location has valet and there are also some lots located close by.  We were running close to being late, so we got into the a lot and easily walked the across the street to the restaurant.   We were seated immediately and then we began to enjoy our evening.  We ordered wine by the glass.  She had a chard and I had the house red.  The house red was good (and extremely reasonable at $7).   On to the food.  We had the Heirloom Tomato salad (very good, lots of egg in it), Sliced Zuccini salad (a lot of zuc flavor, but felt like it was paling in comparison to some of the other dishes flavors).  We had the Hamachi (fantastic and slightly spicy), the pig ear (one of our favorites for the evening), the sweet breads (didn't know it was them bc they were smaller than usual and also fried, but they were good).  We also had the buffalo style pig tail (good, but no different than any other "buffalo" dish) and the shrimp and rabbit sausage springroll (good with a strong sausage flavors) For dessert we opted for the sticky toffee and berries with custard.  Everything was very good.  We had an extremely enjoyable experience. It is slightly noisy (maybe just casue it was Saturday at 8) and the restaurant is smaller than I anticipated, but all in all, we will def go back to try the SPAM burger and Texas Caviar.

Come here for lots of small little tasty dishes with a healthy helping of butter. Our waiter was awesome, was upfront that the kitchen is small so your dishes will be out one by one, order family style, etc... It's noisy and dark inside. You can just have a conversation if you focus on the person next to you and across the table. And the food... Chicken liver toast was surprisingly good, and I am *not* a huge fan of liver. Marrow bone was an awesome contrast of tastes-- ruined by the fact that the bread was deluged in butter rather than lightly graced. BBQ pork belly sandwiches were excellent, but they just didn't fit in with the atmosphere here. At least to me. Hamachi tosada was good but hard to share. Lime was delectable contrast in flavor-- if i order one again I'm gonna keep it all to myself. =P Poutine was very good. Any excuse to eat french fries is a good one in my book. Foie gras biscuit was mmmmm, heavenly-- but again, just too much butter. Dessert-- my friends loved the bacon chocolate crunch bar, I wasn't impressed. It's delicate and light and not at all what I expected. Berries were very good, and the tres leches was awesome. Well, would've been more awesome if the bed of syrup it sat on wasn't so sweet-- but the frosting was nice and light and delicious. End result: I was underwhelmed. It's good, but it could be so much better. It's like, yes, we're soooo good, we could blow you away with our amazing food.... but nah, we've gotten our food to 90% amazing and 10% ok, that's close enough. *sigh*

Animal is amazing. I love how they fuse all these flavors and foods together. I think everyone that lives in LA or visits LA should try Animal at least once. Yeah, seriously... it's that darn good!  Start off with those delicious Pork Belly Sliders and move on to the rest. Oh, did I mention that their meats and produce are fresh from the local farmer's market? Yep, so their menu changes all the time, depending on what is available during the season. Animal is what American Cuisine should of be all about. They serve what most Americans aren't use to eating and what usually would make many people cringe but if you want to be adventurous and need to expand your taste buds... you need to do it Animal style!!!

I was quite anxious to try some of the dishes at first ... but who knew that these different  animal body parts would taste so delicious! I recommend the following dishes: - Chicken Liver Toast - Chicken Hears - Poutine with oxtail gravy n cheddar (my favorite) - Hamashi Tostada Desserts were okay .. didn't love them, so feel free to pass! :)

First off, I wanted to give two stars, because "meh" is kinda what our entire party felt, but there was a mitigating factor.  Pork belly. First off, the reservation process.  good lord.  I knew I'd have to have plenty of advance notice otherwise I'd be stuck with "We have before 6 and after 10:30".  I did not think I'd have to call 3-4 times and play phone tag for a week to experience that pleasure.  Christ, Open Table it or something. Our party of four was seated at a pretty cramped table right next to the hostess station which is almost IN the dorrway  Not unexpected and I don't really place blame, but that doesn't make ya start with the warm fuzzies. Upon ordering another problem arose.  Our server, whom I'll call Ryan Seacrest Jr. Jr. (RSJJ), proceeded to explain what foie gras was to us.  Really RSJJ?  We did not just fall of the truck which delivers your locally sourced, organic turnips.  And while we're at it RSJJ, when I order 2 poutines.  Don't look at me with consternation and say "That might be too much".  I could eat YOU and still have room for two baskets of gravy fries, so shut your pie hole and bring me my fries. sense a trend? Besides me being sour? As to the food.  Here's most of what we had since it's been a while and the menu changes.: chicken liver toast 3 - MEH radicchio, blood orange, pistachio, buttermilk dressing 11* - IT"S SALAD, WHO CARES? lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac* IT"S SALAD, WHO CARES? AND I AM NOT EVEN SURE WHICH ONE WE HAD balsamic pork ribs, tomato & cucumber panzanella - MEH barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw X 2 - OMFG, MY MOUTH JUST CAME poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar X 2 - MEH.  IT'S GRAVY FRIES, NOT HARD TO DO Sweetbreads - TASTY!  THO NO ONE ELSE SEEMED AS ENTHUSED, WHICH WORKED OUT NICE FOR ME. The good news is that everyone was generally full enough that we skipped dessert, so it's not not filling as I feared The main problem is just typical of LA restaurant crapola.  Too much hype and attention to a lot of stuff besides food.  Annoying staff (who I am sure are trained to be that way), unorganized service, etc. But here's the kicker.  The Gorbals downtown (review coming soon) does essentially the same thing, but overall better, in a cooler atmosphere with way less attitude and cheaper.  So, go there now!. And Fatty Cue in Brooklyn (which we visited shortly after) absolutely BLOWS ANIMAL AWAY in all areas. It was a stunning contrast.   Bottom line: Animal is fine, but all the slobbering over their Raw Grass Fed Knobs seems a bit much.

Read the great reviews of the place and anticipated something good or at least unique. Food was over-rated and the service is mediocre at best. Ordered soft shell crab, bone marrow, foie gras, and pork belly bbq sandwich. The pork belly sandwich is the best thing but far from out of this world experience. $50 per person not really worth it. Much rather go to a decent steak house.

Had to be in the Silverlake area on a weeknight and decided on a whim to come try Animal (Angela C.'s review reminded me I've been meaning to check this place out). Initially they were booked including the bar, but the super nice hostess, Lee, scored us a table after about 25 minutes or so. It was busy on a Monday night! Food roundup: Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy: YUMMY!! I heard about this dish and the bf has been digging foie lately. This dish is a perfect combo of flavors, creamy and rich gravy with perfectly seared foie gras on top of a fluffy biscuit. Great seasoning on this, everything worked together in harmony. 5 stars! BBQ pork belly sliders: Very well executed, big hunk of pork belly topped with cheese and slaw. Although this was very good, it was familiar flavors so I wish I ordered something a little more unique than this dish. Pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg: Very thinly sliced the fried so you get a lot of crunchy texture. I do like food that incorporates a lot of lime tang (hey, I'm Vietnamese), but the lime overpowered the dish and it was too tart. Roundup: No frills setting for some meaty FOOD! Definitely get a reservation and be prepared for dishes that you won't find anywhere else.

Animal, you are one sexy beast.   Started off with the asparagus with pancetta, crispy egg and shaved parmesan.  Love the perfectly cooked oozy egg rolled in bread crumbs and fried.  Had a similar preparation at Petrossian and I want to eat my eggs like this all the time.   The hamachi tostada was sooooo good, I could eat this for lunch every day.  For like 8 months.  Straight.  Every day.  The crisp tostada, fresh yellowtail, and creamy avocado were perfectly balanced with the crunchy cabbage slaw tossed in a fish sauce vinaigrette with sliced jalapenos and crispy shallots.  Yup.  Every. Dam. Day. The balsamic pork ribs were OKAY, a little too mushy for my taste but I loved their bread salad and baby tomatoes. And then you have the foie with biscuit and gravy.  HOLY MOLY.  I could eat this every day for dinner but I'd probably keel over from clogged arteries in like, two days.  This was such a great combo of flavors, the rich foie, the flaky biscuit, creamy gravy and that touch of sweet maple syrup.

The main reason we decided to visit Animal was because their foie gras, bisquit, & maple sausage gravy dish had gotten such stellar reviews. I was a bit reluctant to dine on offal such as pig ears, veal brains, and pig tails - and the whole menu seemed heavy on artery-clogging, heart-attack-inducing items - but the reviews were all mainly positive and I found myself looking forward to a new culinary adventure. Animal seems to be too trendy for it's own good and we were probably among the last foodies in LA to visit, but we decided to brave the crowds and managed to make a reservation. When we arrived, I sensed some cooler-than-thou attitude from the staff, which I found amusing, but the poor service was inexcusable. After being ignored by our waiter, a young woman finally took our order, but she was unable to give us her full attention, probably because she probably had another job to do. After a shaky start, the service did improve considerably as our meal progressed, and the busboys in particular deserve special mention for their courtesy and helpfulness. The restaurant was very noisy and it was difficult to have a conversation without shouting. Crowd noise is one thing, but the music could have been turned down a notch. This is a restaurant, not a club - or is it? We ordered 4 dishes to start, but had a feeling we would need to order more... Hamachi Tostada - I had heard that this dish was also highly acclaimed and it seemed like a great option for a lighter dish. The fish sauce vinagrette seemed to also have some citrus and this was a wonderful asian-inspired dish. Could have used a little more hamachi, but I was already impressed. Thai BBQ Quail - Another lighter dish, with similar flavors to the hamachi. The quail was tiny - the leg bone could be used as a toothpick - but very flavorful and nicely grilled. Grilled Baby Broccoli - Served with a soft-boiled egg on top, which then drizzled yolk over the bits of pancetta and parmesan in the dish. Very nice flavors and a good-sized portion. Foie Gras, Biscuit, Maple Sausage Gravy - A seared lobe of foie gras sitting on a light bisquit with a gravy made from maple syrup and bits of sausage. Very rich and slightly sweet, the maple is a wonderful complement to the foie gras. It was so delicious and such a perfect conclusion to our meal that when it came time to decide on another dish to order, we passed on the rabbit dishes we were considering and ordered another foie gras bisquit! They even added a little extra foie gras the second time. Decadent, delicious, and divine! When our waiter asked if we wanted dessert, I told him THAT was our dessert. My only complaint is that the wine list is mediocre at best. The sample list on their website showed some intriguing offerings, which were unfortunately not available this evening. We ordered a bottle that was nothing special, but the same price as more exceptional wines I've had elsewhere. Maybe next time, beer might be a better choice. Overall, I was impressed with the quality and originality of the food. It wasn't as fatty or carb-heavy as I was expecting, and I would definitely return and try some of the heartier or unusual items like the pig ears, poutine w/ oxtail gravy, and pork belly sliders. The rabbit dishes also sound promising. And the foie gras loco moco still beckons. Based on this experience, I'd like to visit their new seafood spin-off: Son of a Gun.

This exotic menu marries veal with french fries, foie gras/quail eggs/ spam and a hamburger patty, plus many other seemingly uncommon but ultimately delicious meat combos.   This is a true carnivores delight (think T-rex style carni) and a vegetarian's nightmare!  I picked and prodded around the dishes, being a little leery with "tail, spam, pork belly or neck" in the name of foods, but had a delicious dining experience. I definitely recommend going with a group of people so you can try a bunch of dishes and experiencing this dining conundrum.   A few recommendations (I think we ordered 11 plates between 4 people)- Asparagus w/egg Kale salad Oxtail and fries Beet salad Hamachi foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger- CRAZY ONE!

Animal is "different". I love their different types of food and their different styles of preparation. They follow the "small plates" concept, where you order a bunch of small plates and share. I like that too because I like to try a lot of things. Decor is chill and casual. Service was fine, but it could've been better. There was a lot of waiting and trying to flag down the server. We ordered 3 things. 1) Chicken Liver Toast - interesting, but not my favorite. However, it is only $3, so you don't lose much from trying it. Not a HUGE dish, so don't expect to share it with more than 2 people. 2) Lamb Neck with Fava Beans & Daikon in Balsamic Vinaigrette - Meat was cooked well. I liked the composition of the dish, but it didn't blow me away. 3) Foie Gras with Biscuit & Maple Sausage Gravy - decadent and very rich. It also took a LONG time to prepare/cook. Portion size was excellent. They give you a HUGE slab of Foie Gras, seared with salt to balance the sweet maple sausage gravy. There's also a fluffy biscuit (delicious) and spice from the sausages. This dish had all the flavors, and I would've loved to eat more if it weren't SO rich. That's not the restaurant's fault though. That's just the nature of the dish. So food is worth 4 stars. Service is worth a bit below that. However, Animal is definitely unique and deserving of a trip.

Well I would have given this more stars if it weren't for the service... Reservation 10:00 pm for 8 people Actually sitting down after being told only 10 min@ 9:45 - 10:30 pm Service was off kilter, we had a server but we had to hunt him down from the bussers and the bar keep. ok ok - so we ventured here to celebrate a birthday party for 2 people, bottle of DOM - Check- Good company- Check- Good food- check. Animal, you get head, tail, feet, butt, brain and basically anything on that animal! This place is hip and loud, the people here go for i believe the atmosphere and food. Well, let me fill you in the smorgasbord we had at our table. MEAT MEAT MEAT oh yeah FISH... I was so bummed they were out of the asparagus :( - i heard it was amazing.. maybe next time 1. baby kale, pecorino, lemon chili vinaigrette, crouton 9- This was DELICIOUS! Earthy with a hint of the spicy pungent bite at the end which popped in your mouth along with the dressing, garlic and seasonings... a definite must have! 2. chicken liver toast 3- ok not a big fan of liver - but hey i will try anything once...the caramelized onions were amazing and the chicken liver was smooth and creamy and melted in your mouth.. then POW you get the taste of the liver...ok I'm done- if you liver this is a good thing! 3. Alaskan halibut, corn, wild fennel, chanterelle, lobster butter 18- OMG! the corn - the freakin corn! the halibut! the freakin halibut, the butter just tied it all in nicely with a hint of the fennel. This was one of my favorites this evening. The fish flaked nicely and melted in your mouth with ease, each bite was like heaven all embodied in a 4 ounce piece of fish..ok 3 please! 4. pig tails, "buffalo style," celery, ranch 11- had a bite of my friends "just to taste" and i was kind of disappointed in the fact the Louisiana hot sauce over powered the entree. Shit anyone can put Louisiana hot sauce on something. not a fan 5. pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg 12- had a bite of this as well, ok ok it sounds disgusting, but you live once and you should try it once- this was a mouthful of WHAM! over indulging your taste buds with chili, lime, and spicy sauces... yes a definite must have! 6. barbecue pork belly sandwiches, slaw 12- another one of my favorites- this is a real gem, pork sliders for $12 ok whats the deal why you gouging me for a slider? (takes bite) DAMN! ok ok i would pay it again, this slider is full of flavor the BBQ is the perfect blend of sweet and spicy, bold and sassy, all of the above and it enticed me with its deliciousness...yes a must have! 7. crispy pig's head, pickled vegetable aioli, charred garlic scape 13- kind of freaky right!~ ok yeah i wasn't a big fan either once i found out what it was i was going to test out next... surprisingly it was good, crispy fried, tender in the inside and had the consistency of corned beef. it was pretty good.. i would toss this in a basket on whether to get it again - it's heavy! consider getting it... 8. veal brains, with sumac 14- the party i was with was intimidated by this plate, to me i always eat stuff like this but i was a little disappointed, it seemed the brains were deep fried or pan fried to have that crispiness to it and soft and mushy in the inside- expected its brains- however, i was not expecting the over powered flavor of the sumac that swirled around your taste buds, be weary- if you're not used to eating brains, its a good try but the texture will def throw you. asi asi- - i would pass on this dish 9. coconut sweetbreads, raita, mango, tamarind 15- i was only lucky enough to eat a smidgen of this... this also was deep fried, it had good flavor and the tamarind definitely surprised us and kind of smoothed out the saltiness of the organ meat we had just indulged in. i would pass 10. Thai BBQ quail, scallion, citrus, cashew, yogurt 19- quail- really - the cute little delicious, full of flavor, melt in your mouth bird... oh yeah - this little bird is another great hit for the table- the quail cooked perfectly- of course dark meat only, the citrus sauce and the bite of the cashew all melded into your mouth wonderfully. this is a must have! 11. marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions.- first time tasting the ever popular good for you bone marrow- this came out one per plate had a chimichurri sauce and served with grilled Texas toast. at this point and time i felt my arteries clogging. this was quite delicious, only could have a little but wanted more. of course we had to share! I would get this again, this was a good thing just make sure you ease up on the chimichurri sauce this can be overwhelming. If you want it get it 12. foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger 28- Fois gras, yummy super soft fluffy and melts in your mouth, spam a little too salty for me, hamburger-mmmm this my friend is it- so well worth it- a must have! Wish I had room for dessert- maybe next time! :)

Cons: Uncomfortable, cold atmosphere...even a bit snobby Food was mediocre (chicken liver toast was decent, pig ears tasted overly pickled, veal brains were my fave, sweetbreads were forgettable and the loco moco was too muddled) Pros: None really.  For the price and quality, I will not go back.  I'd much rather go to Son of a Gun.

I don't quote know how to write this review, almost too scared to. I've been trying to come here for the last year or so, but it's a bit of a drive, hard to find people to go with, they don't take reservations over 8 people and mostly I've just been a little bitch. Well. LITTLE BITCH NO LONGER! I have finally, FINALLY gorged myself silly here. Animal is amazing. They have no sign, just look for the windows full of happy people. I'm a huge fan of the chefs, Jon and Vinny, and giddily brought my cookbook, thinking they would sign it, then warmly invite me to the kitchen where I take turns cooking some of the food, take a picture with a skillet or two, crack open a beer together and become buddies. Unfortunately that didn't happen, but what did was this encounter with some of the most flavorful, texturally perfect, boldly delicious food I've ever had. The bad: I wasn't a fan of the boston shrimp, the bacon chocolate bar or tres lech cake. Let's get that out of the way. The good: The Bone Marrow was f-ing delicious. Two hunks of toasted bread, one long bone. Scoop that stuff out, tell yourself it's garlic butter and just go to town. Bet you've never...had...a...bone...that...good. Oxtail Poutine - very heavy, thick gravy and flavor. I liked it a lot, mixed with cheese and over crisp french fries it would be great with a cold beer. Foie Gras Loco Moco - the priciest dish on the menu, but definitely worth trying. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. It's got a bit of sweetness and isn't as heavy tasting as it looks. The quail egg was delicious too and I wish I could tell you what the components did for the dish, but honestly at this point I was just shoveling. Pork ear - Not what I expected. Strong, strong zesty flavor, it did not feel stringy or crispy (which is what I figure ears taste like), but instead melting-ly soft. It was good enough I would order it again. Finally...my favorite, hands down...the pork belly sliders. My god, I can still remember sitting there, buttery bun on buttery pork in both hands, bbq sauce running down my face. I know it's there, I can feel it, staining a dark, ruby red but I don't care. I see the girl in front of me with a glazed, overjoyed look on her face. She seems hypnotically, almost druggedly content, and I realize that same mesmerized look is on my face. With half-closed, heavy-lidded eyes we blink at each other in mutual gratification and keep on steadily, rhythmically eating, our shoulders swaying back and forth to the music in the background, melting-pork and crisp, browned skin flowing together in our mouths, bbq sauce dripping from our fingers to slowly fall on our plates like raindrops....perfect raindrops.

This place is pretty pricey for food, especially since it comes in appetizer size portions.  Great place to for an adventure in your mouth.   We were a little disappointed since we went there to try the poutine            ( fries/cheese/oxtail gravy) and they ran out.  We stuck to the most "normal" food since this was our first time and we wanted a reason to come back... Which  we had the pork belly sliders, hibachi tostada, and chicken liver toast....AWESOME!!! Place is hard to find since there is no name on the front of the restaurant.  But if you are up for something new, this is definitely  the place.

After numerous attempts at trying to make a reservation, I finally succeeded.  I made sure to get the right time and date that we wanted and had to plan at least four weeks in advance.   On my way to the restaurant, I nearly passed it since it's pretty obscure.  Luckily, the valet parking sign helped to pinpoint the exact location of the restaurant.   The restaurant is a tapas style wine bar and the menu changes daily.  You pretty much order small dishes for the table to share and they figure out a way to serve the dishes to you to make sure that it progresses nicely throughout the night.   Here are the dishes that we ordered and that I would recommend to anyone if they still have it on the menu.  All of them were delicious and you can tell that everything is freshly made.  Awesome restaurant in LA!   Just make sure you make a reservation!   Baby Kale, Pecorino, Lemon Chili Vinaigrette Pig Ear, Chili, Lime and Fried Egg Barbeque Pork Belly Sandwiches Hamachi Tostada, Herbs, Fish Sauce Vinaigrette Foie Gras, Biscuit, Maple Sausage Gravy Flat Iron, Sunchoke Hash, Truffle Parmesan Fondue Sticky Toffee Pudding

I feel like I've been trying to go to Animal for years but something always blocks my advances. Not that I'd ever blame my friends for inviting me there without a reservation only to find the place packed, I would never do that. But a guy has got to have his foie gras loco moco! Finally that fateful night of meaty indulgence was upon us, and we had secured an actual reservation to dine. Four of us descended on the minimalistic restaurant and entered a world of gastronomical delights. We tried to order a little bit of everything and my only regret was not ordering more. Let's begin; Chicken Liver Toast - Creamy, livery, and a nice way to start. My sister makes a better version, but this was good for eating out; http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Tostada - To appease our women, we had to get some lighter food. The fish filled Mexican-ish tostada was just okay, nothing stellar, but it was light and refreshing; http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Melon Salad - More offerings for the women folk. This time it was razor thin strips of fancy-pants melon. Good stuff, but too fruity for me; http://www.yelp.com/biz_… BBQ Pork Belly Sliders - Possibly the best dish of the night. Amazing quality of pork that went perfectly with the slaw and non-obtrusive bun. Melting fat with a touch of pork doesn't get much better than that. I wish they added some crispy pork skin to the slaw to pork it up a notch but it was still out of this world good; http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Ravioli - I can't remember what the filling was but I do remember perfectly cooked pasta and a nice brown butter sauce; http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Salad? - What the hell?! I don't remember ordering so many non-meaty dishes! I must have been way too nice to my wife for some reason, maybe I did something bad that week, oh well. It was a salad for sure, can't remember much else; http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Foie Gras Loco Moco - Here we go! This is what I had been waiting forever for, everything that is good in life, piled into a single beautiful package. Foie, spam, egg, burger, oh my! Each element was executed splendidly and complimented each other very well. My only complaint was that I had to share this with three other people! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Ox Tail Poutine - We ended on a light note of fries, gravy, ox tail, and cheese. So rich and so good! This was a huge portion for the price and would have been tough to finish alone. The loco moco should be had solo, but this one is for sharing for sure! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Overall a very good meal. I wish I hadn't been so nice to the ladies but I'm sure I needed to be. I must go back to try more of the menu and to enjoy the loco moco all to myself.

Bunch of sickos abusing ducks and other animals. This restaurant should be named Animal Abuse not Animal. The regular patrons here are the true animals. Foie gras involves force-feeding ducks with a tube down their throats so their livers become engorged so that low integrity chefs can make a buck my serving it to customers whose selfishness and lack of ethics is only second to that of the chefs themselves.

Despite the intense pain I experienced after my last meal at Animal, I was happy to go back.  Maybe this is just coincidence, but it happened again.  I left holding my food-tightened belly, groaning, and though you might guess this happens to me often, my stomach is generally very strong. Still, I enjoyed my dinner, this time with a party of six.  We dined family style and were able to try a large part of the menu, which was almost entirely different from what I remembered. The few things I repeated were consistent with my prior experience, with the exception of the steak.  The chicken liver toast was again a highlight, and I can't imagine why anyone would come to Animal without indulging in that rich livery balsamic-brightened treat.  The quail was perhaps the best dish we had, this time with plum char-siu, apple, peach, and yogurt.  The little bird was beautifully cooked, tender, meaty, and easy to suck off the bone.  There was a lot of flavor in the succulent quail, and it was enhanced by the tart plum which was in turn balanced by the cooling yogurt, curls of cucumber, and sweeter cut fruits.  The poutine with oxtail gravy was as heavy as I remembered, and I didn't like it for more than a couple bites.  The biggest disappointment, though, was the flat iron with artichoke hash and truffle parmesan fondue.  This was one of my favorites before, but this time it was stringy and heavy without redemption - in other words, just a bad steak. Thankfully, the rest of the menu made up for this misstep.  The bone marrow with chimichurri and caramelized onions was delicious, goopy and vibrant, served with two thick triangles of buttery brioche.  I also loved the potato agnolotti with caramelized onion butter and parmesan.  This was wonderful, with thin pasta and a butter sauce that was rich and earthy but not overwhelming.  I was happy to try the foie gras with biscuit and maple sausage gravy, an Animal staple that I'm pretty sure you just can't enjoy with the foie gras loco moco also on the table.  This was, of course, heavy, but in a luxurious way that matched the richness of flavor.  The foie was unctuous, almost gelatinous, and the gravy was a great thing to bathe it in.  The biscuit beat the foie there, already soaked by the time it arrived.  We also ate some head and brain - crispy pig's head with pickled vegetable aioli, and veal brains with vadouvan, apple sauce, and carrot.  The pig's head was delicious, breaded and deep-fried like tonkatsu in a flat disc.  It had an even more concentrated pork flavor than your standard tonkatsu, and this was complemented nicely by the aioli and the pretty pickled cauliflower, carrot, and onion.  A long grilled leek finished the plate.  The veal brains were tasty, also breaded and deep-fried, with creamy insides.  The one light dish we had was a hamachi tostada that would've done well at Son of a Gun.  I liked the fresh yellowtail and the bright fish sauce vinaigrette.  The tostada was topped with peanuts and shreds of cabbage and deep-fried shallot - the flavors were nice and snappy.  I only wish the crunchy tostada hadn't been quite so buried. For dessert, we shared the now famous bacon chocolate crunch bar with salt and pepper ice cream.  It was kind of just okay.  I liked the dense chocolate and the salt of the bacon, but I didn't find the bar particularly impressive.  I would've preferred the desserts I had on my previous visit. I like Animal quite a bit.  The changing menu is always exciting and I see why it's one of the few restaurants in L.A. with over a 1000 Yelp reviews to go with its $$$ price range.  It's not my favorite place in town, and I prefer Son of a Gun, but I'll keep going now and then to get my fix of meat fat and tummy pain.

What can I say that hasn't been mentioned?? -Their beer selection is limited and limited to some mediocre beers -The chocolate covered bacon was a HUGE let down. The bacon tasted burnt therefore making it bitter. Aside from those 2 discrepancies, I LOVED it!! Probably the best meal I have had in a very long time. Yes, you feel like you need to run a marathon for the next month, but its worth every calorie!! Standout dish of the night was the hamachi tostada. I can eat this for days! It had the perfect balance of everything (sorry for the lack of description, I was a little buzzed during dinner). I highly sugguest getting a salad or some kind of vegetable dish because all the fatty meat will be too much to handle. Tres leches cake was also out-of-this-world amazing! The sticky toffee nut was pretty effin amazing too. Thank God this place is not walking distance from me.

Tips for future patrons: be sure to bring your appetite, your adventurism, and your wallets. Don't leave home without them. Seriously. And double-check after you've left. Animal is a trendy Los Angeles restaurant that feels a lot like a trendy New York restaurant. Ok, ok so I've never been to New York but that's what I think they're like? Unfortunately for us, trendy Los Angeles eateries usually means out-of-work wannabe actresses waiting for their "big break" while waitressing to pay the bills. Translation? "Meh" service. It's too bad really, because the rest of the guys were were informative and enthusiastic. I guess one bad apple spoils the whole box...(is that how the phrase goes?) Anyways, on to the food! Chicken liver toast- REALLY REALLY GOOD. I can't ever say no to chicken livers (or any livers, for that matter). This one was smooth and flavorful, topped with a sweet onion relish. Oh and the toast was perfect. Just perfect. Marrow bone- meh. I've had marrow bone many different fashions and I honestly like it to be super plain. Some salt on the side and toast with a little herbage is all I need. Or even stewed in some soup is enough to coax a lot of natural flavor. But the chefs decided to top it with a chimichurri that was just a little overpowering and top the chimichurri with caramelized onions. Too much. Barbeque pork belly sandwiches- NEED I SAY MORE? I'm sure you're already picturing it in your head, tasting it on your tongue. Topped with a beautiful slaw, I probably could've eaten 10 of them. Sweetbreads- sweet & sour, I honestly think it kind of tasted like orange chicken (and NO it's not a good thing). Sweetbreads are delicious, but I would've like bigger chunks, or just prepared differently. Not a winner in my book. Veal Brains- really beautifully pan fried. And they used a spice most people don't know about in vadouvan that goes great with carrots and apples. Good dish. Balsamic ribs- OMG. OMG. OMG. TO. DIE. FOR. Next time don't even serve me the arugula salad. Just give me MORE RIBS. Fois gras terrine- nope. Didn't like it. Pickled crab apple? Why? Too sweet. Can't taste fois. That's all I'm saying about that. Fois Gras biscuit & gravy- A beautiful interpretation of the classic (which is definitely a theme throughout the menu). The gravy was made with maple sausage, the biscuit was nice, and the fois cooked perfectly. Flat iron- DROOL. The most flavorful steak sitting on a sunchoke hash and topped with, get this, a truffle parmesan fondue. YEA. The truffles weren't overpowering like a lot of restaurants will do, and the sauce was just silky smooth. Rich and decadent. And this was one of our "lets just throw this one in there because we don't have enough food" add-ons. Thank God. Overall the food was really good. But for the prices your paying you really need to do your homework. Most parties order a bunch of dishes and eat them family style, which is definitely what I would recommend. But really take your time in planning out your menu. There were so many dishes I would've rather tried that probably could've made the experience much better for me. Our menu came out too sweet. Way too sweet. By the end of it I was desperately craving something spicy or tangy. When you eat 10 dishes, each with a sweet element...it really adds up. I'll definitely be coming back to animal, mostly to try the other dishes they put out. It seems like their menu changes quite a bit, and since some of the dishes we wanted ran out before the night was over my work here is not done!

First off, I don't like to eat meat. Seriously. I am not a vegetarian or pescetarian but i am not a hard core carnivore. I have been to Animal THREE times in the last 2 months. I absolutely love all the meat. I was interested by the combinations and all the meats offered. Delish!

It's been done.  My first great dining experience of 2011.  This long-awaited visit was planned, canceled, rescheduled, and now, finally realized.   We arrived for our 1045pm reservation about 30mins early, so we had some time to wait.  The hostess offered our group some beverages, so we whetted our palates with aperitifs for the evening to stimulate our gluttonous appetites.  Having already reviewed the menu, our group of diners, strategized on our plan of attack.  We decided the best way to enjoy this culinary experience would be to proceed family style.   This restaurant is small.  Very small, our group of  was seated at a table that was suitable for 4 small females, but once the food started flowing, we felt it was worth it.  Our group ordered a total of 13 dishes, almost all of which are worthy of mentioning! 1. Chicken Liver Toast (2) - If you like liverwurst pate's of all sorts, this will be another addition to the many pate's of the world.  The beauty of this is that it's made in-house! 2. Hamachi Tostada - Yellow tail sashimi that melts in yo mouf!  Brightened up with citrus and refreshing cabbage and a crisp tortilla flat. 3. Pig Ears - This is something dear to my heart.  These crunchy cartilage gems are a perfect balance of salty, crisp, and fat.  Tied together with lime and chili, this was a home run! 4. Balsamic Ribs - Extremely tender and bold.  The meat literally peels off the bone, and greets the diner with a not-so-sweet balsamic tang. 5. Veal Brains - One of the champs of the night!  Lightly battered and fried to a crisp, these light, almost custardy brains were light-pink in the center, indicating perfect execution!  Possibly one of the best thing I'll eat all year, I'm sure of it. 6.Marrown Bones - I order marrow at any restaurant that serves it.  Who can pass up meat butter?  The chimichurri is a unusual topping, but matches well instead of the traditional parsley salads or gremolatas. 7. Sweetbreads - Clean, lovely thymus glands!  If you love em, you love em....and I do!  Plain and simple. 8. Poutine - A dish that I've experienced last year at the Vancouver Olympics for the first time.  A gastronomic bomb in its simplicity.  Traditionally just fries, cheese curds, and gravy, this updated version utilizes the wonderful back-end meat, that most people shun away from....Oxtails!  Melt in yo mouf tender, the gravy is super rich with bits of gelatinous goodness draping over crispy fries and lovely melting curds. 9. Foie gras loco moco - No explanation needed, cmon guys! 10. Foie gras Terrine - Perfect blend of salty, sweet, crisp toast.  It's foie, you can't disguise it.  Heavenly! 11. Foie gras biscuits and gravy - The best idea in all of gastronomy!  One of the most unctuous experiences I've had all year...given we're only 8 days in, but this is outt've this world.  It's one of those things makes your toes curl into the floor, while you close your eyes, and lean your head back, saying "oh my God" 12. Pork Belly sliders - Pretty delish with a nice ratio of belly to roll.  Again, it completely dissolves in your mouth exploding with the fat rush, followed with the cool, crisp slaw.  I sinned and gone to heaven when i added bone marrow, foie terrine, and even more seared foie to my last bite! Our entire table agreed that this will not be our last visit.  With a foodie relative coming home in a week, reservations have already been secured.  The menu changes daily with a few core items that stay on.  The service was great and attentive.  The people were pretty, and the ambiance was kicking.  Highly recommended!  Pictures in my profile...

All it took to get me begging the bartender to let me move in was the foie gras. I'm serious.

I need to make it a habit to review places right after I eat there! But this wasn't too long ago (2 weeks). My friends and I have been wanting to try Animal for a while but no one ever made reservations, so one day we were in the area and decided to see if there were any openings. We got lucky and had a party of 4 no show so we got a table! However, I believe for us it was fluke, so if you really want to try this place, then make reservations way ahead of time (probably a week or two in advance). The place is pretty small, so I wouldn't recommend going here with a big party (4 is a good number). They had picture frames of random animal body parts which I thought was cool. Anyway, here is what we ordered! Chicken liver toast - Delicious! Even though I'm not a fan of liver in particular. The bread was really good. Marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions - This dish for some reason came out last. But I loved it! I can't exactly describe what bone marrow tastes like, but the caramelized onions were delicious. Barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw - Amazing! Although it's difficult to screw up pork belly I guess. I love love love pork belly - what a curse! I think it tastes like the regular Chinese pork belly buns (the barbeque flavor is subtle). Sweetbreads, pickled okra, benton's country ham, gribiche - I swear I've never heard of sweetbreads until I went to Animal. I didn't know it was an animal body part! It looks kind of like gluten(?) and tastes pretty distinct. Not bad. I liked the added okra. Rabbit legs, mustard, bacon, sugar snap peas, black trumpet - Rabbit tastes like chicken to me. I liked this dish (the most expensive plate we ordered), although I'm pretty sure I would've enjoyed just as much if the meat had been chicken legs (or drumsticks). Bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise - The chocolate crunch bar was good...I didn't think it was anything special though. But once you taste the bacon, it's a really weird combination of flavors in your mouth. But I got used to it after 2-3 bites or so and it was pretty good! I'd definitely come here again! But with any tapas restaurant, it takes a lot to become full, so I'd eat a little bit beforehand. Yay Animal! Next place I want to try: Son of  a Gun!

Great place and definitely a place worth checking out! Beware of how HEAVY and FULL you will be after though. Chicken Liver Toast: You have to be prepared for this if you have never tasted liver before. I, fortunately, actually enjoy chicken liver. It is definitely an acquired taste. Rich, creamy, with that slight grainy texture, this was a great way to start off our meal. Barbeque Pork Belly Sliders: Fatty goodness. With each delectable bite I could feel it going straight to my artieries. Did I care? No. =) Everything from the buns, to the slaw to the pork belly was flavorful. Bone Marrow Chimichurri with Carmelized Onions: Once again very flavorful but heavy. Another rich dish but the sweetness of the carmelized onions complimented the texture of the marrow and the acidity of the chimichurri sauce. Balsamic Pork Ribs: Delicious and tender. The meat fell of the bone so easily. However, I was the least impressed by this dish. It just didn't stand out as well as the other dishes. I've had great ribs at many other places before and these weren't any better. Poutine with Oxtail Gravy and Cheddar: Very, very heavy. We made the mistake of ordering this last. My friends and I were so stuffed. A great dish but the oxtail grazy was overwhelming. I'm not a big fries person but I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the fries in this one. I thought they would get soggy but they stayed crispy for a while. Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Animal. I would definitely return. I wanted to have dessert so bad but I absolutely could not fit anything else in my stomach. I could not even drink more water. THAT was how full I was. Great place and for all those that are interested in trying it out, you definitely should. I will be back and will make room for dessert next time! =)

Oh, Animal, how I dream of you.  I had put this place on my list months ago and, on my last trip to L.A., I made a point to check it out.  I'm sooooo glad I did. We brought a bottle of wine with us and they were kind and helpful with it--no snottiness that I've encountered at other places when you bring your own wine.  Corkage fee isn't cheap, but was doable. We started with the octopus and chorizo dish.  The octopus was cooked perfectly, it was soft and supple and flavorful.  But, the chorizo fell flat and was just okay.  Next, we had the buffalo pig tails, which were amazing.  I had no idea how fatty pig tails are, but it's a yummy fat and that buffalo sauce had a huge vinegar kick to cut the fat coating my mouth.   We moved from there to the pig ear salad with a fried egg on top. This was excellent--the egg, lime, and chili all went together so well.  I could have eaten one on my own.  The balsamic pork ribs were also tasty and super tender.  But, nothing compared to the quail fry with grits and slab bacon. That was one of the best dishes I've eaten all year. The quail was perfectly cooked and the bacon was incredibly flavorful and rich.  Together with the grits, I was in heaven. And, of course, we saved room for the bacon chocolate crunch bar which lived up to it's reputation and was, despite all we had eaten, not too heavy or overwhelming.  I wish I could have one per day....like a vitamin. I'm already dreaming of my next trip back....

All kinds of animal body parts (of the non-reproductive kind) prepared in creative, rich and interesting ways. Recommend the chicken liver toast, foie gras with biscuits and gravy, and the poutine with oxtail. Pass on the desserts; they're so-so and at $7 a pop, not necessary. Not many cheap wine options. If you're a wine-with-dinner kind of person, as I am, then I recommend getting the Animal house wine which is $20/bottle and not terrible. Go as a group so that you can try more things. For a party of four big eaters, we got 10 dishes, 2 desserts and 2 bottles of wine. We were stuffed. Need to make reservations at least a month in advance for popular dining days/hours. They have a 15-minute grace period on your reservation time, and they stick to it. Be on time! This is not for the faint of stomach people, so go with your adventurous foodie friends. Prepare to spend about $50 pp +tax/tip (if you split a bottle of wine), plus $5 for valet parking because Fairfax is a nightmare. But, I will say: It's worth trying.

Quick tip: You may not immediately think of Animal for late-night grub, but trust me on this one: on your next Friday/Saturday out in Weho or Hollywood, grab a few friends and hightail it out of there a little early to grab a table at Animal.  Late night = no wait = impromptu food adventures are always a win.  Order poutine + whatever else your drunk/buzzed hearts desire and I guarantee you will remember "that awesome night we went to bar XYZ and then ditched to go to Animal" for a long time to come. The best way to experience Animal, whether you reserve ahead for a dinner spot or swoop in just before its 1AM close is to 1. come hungry, 2. come prepared to drop decent $$ for really great food, and 3. share plates in groups of 3-4 -- start off with ~2 plates pp and gauge afterwards whether the party's hungry enough to do a 'greatest hits' round). oh and 4. be prepared for some serious waiter eye candy. I have tried at least 3/4 of this menu (Animal has popped my food-cherry for many an animal part, including foie gras, chicken liver, pig ear, pig head...) and have never, ever been disappointed.   Best dishes IMO: + POUTINE + Chicken liver toast + Foie gras with maple biscuit & gravy (I much prefer this foie gras to the loco moco, which is just too too much) + Quail (formerly fried, most recently thai bbq) + Gnocchi (not on the current menu but I'm sure will be back) Honorable Mentions/Worth a Try: Pig ear Pig head Pork belly sandwiches Tres leches Sticky toffee pudding Good beer and wine selection, though the wine is fairly pricey ($50+ per bottle, ouch) and $20 corkage fee.  I'll suffer it gladly, because Animal is one pricey habit I wouldn't dream of kicking.

I'm going to give this place 4 stars for its creativity and excellent service but 3.5 stars for the food. The food is good, but it may taste better when we try this place again.   {ORDER} * Quail fry, grits, chard, slab bacon, maple jus - this does not get enough recognition. We love quail and for it to be battered like friend chicken, it was a feast for our stomachs! So rich, but oh so good. The batter is just perfect! * Barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw - followed my Yelpers' reviews and loved it. Only thing I would say is easy on the sauce. * Bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise - it is definitely very chocolate-y and very rich. But I love the crunchiness of it. Don't expect to taste a lot of bacon either. {DIDN'T ENJOY} * Pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg - the only part of this dish we liked (and it's bc we have a thing for eggs!) is the fried egg. The dish had an overload of lime, I felt like I was literally eating limes, it was way to citrus-y for my appetite. * Marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions - best part of this dish was the bread. Let's just say we didn't even finish the plate. We had better bone marrow elsewhere (CUT!). * Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - creative yet not something I would order again. I felt like the foie gras did not go well with the biscuit. The texture did marry quite well to me. *Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - our least favorite dish. {ENVIRONMENT} Raw, low lighting, good service, great place for a small group and date.

What distinguishes a fine-dining establishment from the 4-stars and the 5-stars?  For me, that'd be excellent service, knowledgeable servers (ask them anything and they can answer), delicious food (with not a single bad dish), creativity, and overall experience.  I know that's a lot to ask, but Animal delivered.  Of course, the company I kept also contributed to a wonderfully fun, enjoyable night out in LA! The ambiance here is very minimal - black walls and wooden seats - and the restaurant itself is tiny (fits maybe 40-50 guests) with dim lighting.  I would say a party of 4 would be the ideal size for Animal, but it also fit our party of 6 nicely.  It's better to come with a few others because this restaurant is tapas style, meaning that most of the dishes here are small mini plates meant to be shared in a family-style way. I liked all the dishes we ordered - some more than others.  I'll categorize them based on my personal preference. LOVED: -  chicken liver toast ($3) - this might be an acquired taste, but i grew up on weird delicacies so this was quite normal to me.  don't think chicken liver... think PATE on toast.  delicious, simple, and creamy! -  marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions ($10) - not only is bone marrow good for you, it is good!  the chimichurri was delicious too.  it comes with delicious buttered toast so scoop that marrow onto the toast and you've got yourself a party in your mouth. -  BBQ Pork Belly Sandwiches ($12) - they look like sliders, its a thick slab of pork belly and coleslaw in between two pieces of bread that tastes like a croissant.  the bread was warm and soft, but was still able to withstand the fatty juices from the pork and BBQ sauce.  the pork is thick and juicy and the cool, tangy coleslaw balanced out the fattiness of the pork and saltiness of the marinade.  you can't go wrong with this dish. -  hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut ($14) - my favorite of the night!  every flavor balanced perfectly.  the hamachi is hidden beneath a bed of seasoned cabbage, and sits on top of a perfectly crisp tostada.  crispy, crunchy, refreshing, citrusy, and spicy are the words i would use to describe this dish.  it is a perfect blend of textures and flavors. LIKED: -  rabbit loin, benton's bacon, parsnip, apple ($12) - some of the others in my group loved this dish, but it wasn't a stand out to me.  don't be scared of rabbit.  if you told me this was a pork dish i would have believed you. -  sweetbreads, creamed spinach, capers, oyster mushroom ($16) - i think its because i've had better sweetbreads elsewhere i couldn't help but compare this dish to others.  i'm not sure i loved the preparation - they fried the sweetbreads so it lost some of its creaminess in the process.  the components of this dish all came together nicely.  by the way, sweetbreads are thymus glands (not bread).   OKAY: -  pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg ($12) - my least favorite dish of the night.  the pig ears are sliced into thin pieces then stir fried with chili and lime.  there's a fried egg on top that you're supposed to pop so that it flows into the pig ears.  too much crunch for my liking, but then again, i'm not big on pig ears to begin with. -  balsamic pork ribs, heirloom tomato & cucumber panzanella ($16) - don't get me wrong, this dish was good.  however, the balsamic glaze on the ribs was way too overpowering.  i had to scrape some of the sauce off to really taste the ribs.  the ribs themselves were falling off the bone tender.  again, i don't think you can go wrong with a dish like this - there are no weird body parts to scare you off. Service was excellent.  Our server was friendly and helpful and very attentive throughout the night.  We asked him so many questions and he gave great recommendations without trying to burn a hole through our wallets (basically, he didn't try to recommend the most expensive things on the menu - not even close).   I think Animal is worth trying at least once.  It's a great place for you to get out of your comfort zone and experience foods you never thought you would try!

Foie gras ! Bone Marrow ! Pork Belly Sliders ! Pig Ears ! and the Ribs oh so good! And some other dishes, totally forgot what it was though. Me and my friends ordered 2 of everything while we were there and there were only 5 of us. All devoured, all yummy. I wasn't so fond of the bacon crunch bar.. or any of us haha we kinda just left it there. Really want to come back and try the loco moco!

I ended up here when a date picked me up and asked what I was in the mood for and I replied, "Meat." We looked up some places quickly and ended up at Animal. I would suggest making a reservation but we were lucky and as we walked up a reservation had just called in to cancel. Service was nice, friendly attentive but not stalking my water glass every time I took a sip. We ordered a huge steak for two which had escargot on it and some appetizers. Details are gone since this review should have been written a couple months ago. The staff informed us since the steak would take a while for the entire preparation but with a decent date, it is nice. The wait was really worth it, everything was excellent. I wish I was eating there right now.

Quite the hidden gem on Fairfax, if you can even call it that with all the buzz this restaurant is getting.  I was pleasantly surprised by my dining experience at Animal and would highly recommend it to anyone up for a delicious, fun and unique meal. Although the decor is somewhat nonexistent, the food completely makes up for it and the style of which the food is served (small plates for sharing) makes it an all around wonderful place to dine with a gregarious crew.  A lot of the food pairings don't make any sense but they do once you taste them.  The innovative ingredients really make it all come together. Highlights of the meal included: chorizo toast, foi gras over gravy soaked biscuit, barbecue pork belly sandwiches and hamachi tostada, In addition to the food, they have an excellent wine selection.

Incredible food and service! Plus a whole bottle of wine for $20.....I soooo wish this was located in the Bay Area. Its nondescript exterior and dark/cozy interior really adds to the feeling that we've discovered a hidden gem in L.A. Definitely make reservations for this place- it's small and crazy busy.

It doesn't matter what time you get a reservation, this place is great. The servers are really nice and most of the all the price is very reasonable for the quality of food you're getting. I suggest trying the bone marrow and toast with the house chardonnay.  Also the bacon chocolate bar with ice cream is out of this world.

I don't think this is the "best meal I've ever eaten", as some other's have said, but Animal is exceptional and the most creative cuisine I have ever eaten. I came with my girlfriend on a Thursday night at 7pm and it was only 25% full. By 8pm, the place was packed and bustling. It even got hard to hear what she was saying after a while, but great vibe! Our server was very attentive and offered his opinion on what was on the menu. We ordered 3 meat dishes, and he told us he thought it was too heavy, so we switched to 2 heavy meat dishes and one lighter dishes. We ordered the following, which was served to us one by one: -hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut - light and refreshing, highly recommended! -poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - basically meat and meat sauce on top of french fries. It seems simple, but it was amazing! The fries never got soggy, and it actually didn't taste too heavy or too salty -foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger - OMG i love foie gras, and this foie gras was delish. If I came again, i would order TWO foie gras dishes hahahaha! But, this dish was great, but i could've done without the hamburger layer, I thought it was a bit dry. We also finished off with the bacon crunch bar, which i thought was disappointing. It was super rich and chocolatey, yet....salty? I thought it was weird....i want my dessert to be dessert. Once you're done with dinner, I would also recommend going to Canter's Deli next door to pick up some pastries!

One of my top 3 New American restaurants. Offers you head-to-tail type dining without being over the top about it.They also offer some dishes where you are like "Oh I have seen that before", but in terms of taste they take it one step higher. Favorites: Bone Marrow, Pork Sliders, and Pig Ears. Make reservations 3 weeks ahead. Yea. Not joking.

The biggest issue that my friends and I had with Animal was figuring out how God could be fucking all of our mouths at once. The answer: God is a whore. A delicious, delicious whore. 2011 is the year of trying new things and I figured Animal would be a great place to kick that off. So we made a reservation for 5 folks (including 1 amenable pescatarian) and headed over on a Monday night. I'd heard horrible things about the wait there, so we chose an off night on purpose and had no issues. First thing I noticed MEXICAN COKE! Score! I sadly didn't get it cause I wanted to save as much stomach space as possible, but damn! Next time I want an afternoon snack I'm heading there for Mexican coke and a bite. Anyway... Even though I'd been looking at other yelp reviews and the sample menu online, I still had a hard time deciding. So we broke out a pen and did some voting. Our delightful waiter Jeff said that we hadn't ordered enough, but he was wrong. We ordered just right.  The dishes (in order of appearance): 1) Chicken Liver Toast: Very simple, very clean flavors. I could eat spreadable meats all day and this was just right and a nice way to start the meal. We got three orders to split between the 5 of us. We probably could have done with just two. 2) Grilled Baby broccoli with soft egg: Most seemed to like this. I thought that the flavors varied from bite to bite, but not in the best way. Like sometimes what was a nice char in one bite was an unpleasant mouthful of charcoal in the next. But when it got it right, it got it right. 3) Foie gras terrine with pickled crab apple: I'm sure this is exactly what foie gras is supposed to taste like and I hated it. It felt like I was licking a grease trap. Just thinking about it makes me ill. But, others seemed to like it, so I assume it is just my taste buds and not anything that was actually wrong with the dish. I really liked the pickled crab apple though, so it was worth the $20. 4) Poutine with oxtail gravy: This seemed to be the dish that everyone was really excited about and it did not disappoint. It was really, really heavy, which I think was the reason that we had enough food. I have no idea how they got the fries to stay so crisp after they covered them with cheese and gravy, but they were delicious. I need to find a butcher that sells oxtail, cause this is something I want all the time. 5) Striped bass with creamed spinach: This arrived at the same time as the poutine and did a great job to offset the heaviness. The fish was cooked perfectly. The spinach was great and there were some crispy mushrooms in there to add texture. 6) Rabbit leg: Fuck me. I had a pet bunny when I was younger, so I had a little remorse ordering this dish, but I feel like Alex would have gladly sacrificed himself if he knew he was this delicious. I took the bone to get the real animal experience out of animal, but the meat just feel right off cause it was so tender. 7) Tres leches: I didn't even want dessert. I was so full. But Casey said someone highly recommended this so we had to try it. You really need to get a nice even slice of it to get all the flavors together. It was delicious. I highly recommend Animal to anyone. We played it somewhat safe this time just to get a taste of somethings, but next time I feel like we'd branch a little further out of our comfort zone.

At last!!!!  I FINALLY got to try Animal!  :D The award for the most awesome dish of the night goes to... THE FOIE GRAS, BISCUIT, & MAPLE SAUSAGE GRAVY!  So good that we ordered two, and agreed that it would be the dish to come back to Animal for.  The maple sausage gravy made the dish -- sweet, creamy, savory, and spicy -- in the right balance and combination.  It was tastebud heaven!  So good that if the foie gras wasn't there, I wouldn't miss it.  (Blasphemy, I know!)   Runners up: 1.   The foie gras loco moco: really loved the balance of the sweet soy sauce with the spicy (Srichacha sauce!) and savory elements of the dish.  Liked the spam and foie gras combo, but could have done without the dry and dense hamburger meat.  Bleh.   2.  BBQ pork belly sandwiches: it was good -- the pork was a bit dry when biting into the lean meat.  Really liked the tangy slaw (which I thought was better than the pork itself).  I think the pork belly sliders at Momofuku were far superior to Animal's.   Honorable mention: 1. The bone marrow with chimichurri sauce -- the chimichurri sauce was a bit tangy...more than I like.  It was more vinegary than garlicky...so I wasn't that big of a fan.  The chimichurri sauce overwhelmed the bone marrow flavors, especially since it was drenched in the sauce. Should be removed from the menu (based on our experience that night): 1.  The oxtail poutine -- the fries were overly deep fried and stale tasting.  The gravy was too salty (bottom of the pot?), and the oxtails were bland and flavorless aside from the charred/burnt portions.  We ate a couple of bites, thinking it would grow on us, but unfortunately, it didn't!  I think they messed the dish up, since it has garnered so many positive reviews on Yelp previously.  Luckily for us, our server was kind enough to comp the dish for us.   The service was awesome, the food was very good, great wine (2008 Clua, El Solá d'en Pol, Terra Alta), and we were very happy stuffing our faces until we could barely breathe.

OH EM GEE! The boyfriend picked this place out for birthday dinner and it did not disappoint. barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw - did i just bite into a little piece of meat heaven? this is a definite must order. make sure to eat this one hot as it doesn't taste as good later on in the night. melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread - really cheesy! this is a great dish if you like cheese. i wish it came with more bread, kind of ran out at the end. quail fry, grits, chard, slab bacon, maple jus - gourmet southern comfort food comes to mind. while this dish is good, there wasn't anything unique so i'd pass on it next time. bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise - i love anything with bacon in it. i just wish the bacon was more pronounced and there was more crunch. overall, a very rich chocolatey goodness for sharing. i wouldn't say that this is a must get signature dish though. date tart, toffee sauce - only 3 left. rarity always makes us order it and now i understand why there were only 3 left. everything was perfect about this dish. i'm glad i got in on some of this date action. I was pleasantly surprised that the dinner was quite affordable too. Our bill came out to about $70 total. I'm coming back to get my slider fix and to try the hamachi tosada and sweetbreads. Maybe they'll have some more of that date tart or something equally delicious.

Love Animal!  After hearing all the hype, i had to try, and was anything but let down.  After the first meal there, i immediately made plans to come back, and often.   The hamachi was delicious, poutine is everything you want it to be, rabbit spring rolls a very unique take on both rabbit in rolls.  But above all else, the pork belly sliders.... oh man.  I have dreams about these things, and will be back at least monthly to get my fix.

Hamachi tostada: amazing flavors from great ingredients. fresh and perfect example of a great appetizer. Kale salad: fresh and basic. bread crumbs give such a great texture. Pork belly sandwich: great, great dish. perfectly cooked barbecue + BBQ sauce + slaw = hope you're drooling by now! poutine: my first poutine and it was beyond my expectation! oxtail gravy was such a brilliant addition to the already great dish :) must-try! tres leche: perfection, everything about it was golden.

I am a lover of the more unusual foods and Animal definitely delivered. Super yummy. I did enjoy the more exotic items like veal brains, but I wasn't too crazy about the bone marrow. Make sure that you make reservations! I went there on a Wednesday night and it was packed! We had 9 pm reservations too. Our check wasn't too bad for four dishes and two ice teas - around $70. Be wary that the portions are pretty small so I wouldn't come here with a giant appetite. But if you're looking to be adventurous with your palate this is the place to go!

OK So i wanted to pig out for Mardi Gras and I kept hearing about this place from my fellow-foodie friend, Dan. And so what better time than to pig out on meat than here at Animal. I have to say that I love this place for the fact it's damn tasty and adventurous at the same time. It has that small plate feel like a Tapas place. So I recommend sharing each dish with at least one other person. We were told average number of plates people get is about 5-6 plates and then one 1 dessert at the end to finish off. SO that was the plan. We started out with some beer. I ordered their Beligan beer called "Delirium Tremens" which our server recommended since I told him I like Blue Moon. Quite tasty and way better than Blue Moon. Although it was quite pricey at $14 a bottle, it was well-worth it. Would've ordered another but I didn't wanna break the bank. On to food...we first got served the Beef Bone Marrow which was delicious! It was served with a Chimichurri Sauce and caramelized onions  and served up with big pieces of toast. Second came the Pig Ears with chili, lime and a fried egg on top. Talk about an ultimate breakfast type dish! Mmm mmm good! Ears were nice n crispy and the saltiness of it played well with the sourness of the lime and the heat from the chili. And of course the yummy fried egg on top just added that goodness a fried egg can only give. Like I said a yummy ultimate breakfast in your mouth experience! Next came the Veal Brains with Vadouvan (indian spice mixture), apple sauce, and carrots. I've never had veal brains before and I must say I like it. The brains itself doesn't have much flavor to it. However it served as a nice texture to the dish. The best way I can describe the texture was that it was velvety and silky smooth kind of like soft tofu. The outside was a little crispy and the sauce and spices was amazing and went well with the brains. Highly recommend giving it a try even though it may sound wierd. Then came one of my fave dishes of the night, BBQ Pork Belly Sandwiches with slaw. OMG! I nearly fainted because it was that good. Saucy sweet & tangy BBQ Sauce with a nice crispy fatty goodness of the Pork Belly. Definitely a must! Then on to the Poutine which were Fries topped with Oxtail gravy and cheddar. Man that oxtail gravy, I could've eaten that just by itself with some rice. IT was sooo good. Melt in your mouth meat that just coated your tongue with its goodness. And the fries were nice n crispy. Very good and highly recommended to get. At this point we were almost full but could stand to get one more dish. So we decided to get the Flat Iron with sunchoke hash, topped with truffle parmesan fondue. OH Dayum this was awesome! Such a powerful flavor that truffle was! The meat was so tender and juicy & cooked to perfection.  I do gotta say it was a bit salty for my taste but still tasty and good nonetheless. So finally we get to dessert after all that. And like the saying goes, there's always room for dessert. So my friend ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding with mascarpone and orange, and I ordred the Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar with Salt & Pepper Anglaise. Both of these desserts were outstanding. I usually don't like Sticky Toffee Pudding because its usually too sweet and dense. However, this one was quite balanced. The orange flavor definitely helped it out. My Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar was out of this world! I would have to say the bacon wasn't as prominent in this dish. It served as a textural component with hints of smokiness and saltiness. Think of this dish as a really good bar of Nestle Crunch Candy Bar. In terms of the coffee, it was just ok. Nothing too spectacular about it. Overall, this was a great experience and I can't wait to go back and try the others on the menu I did not have a chance to try. Although, the menu does change often. So hopefully some of the ones I wanted to try will still be there. I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes taking a food adventure and loves good honest food that's OH SO GOOD!

Had a great meal there with my brother the other night, ordering as many dishes as we could and sharing them tapas style. We started with the bone marrow, BBQ pork belly sliders, and the oxtail poutine .. All three dishes were incredible, I won't be able to look at any other pulled pork sandwich the same ever again.. For our mains I had the yellowtail collar which was light and perfectly cooked after our trio of appetizers and beers we drank. My brother ordered the staple item Foie Gras loco moco, an absolutely delicious take on the hawaiian classic. Finally for dessert we chose to try the bacon chocolate crunch bar with the salt&pepper ice cream, sounds weird but makes perfect sense when it reaches your mouth.. Now being as good as that was, I actually prefer the sticky toffee pudding , it was heavenly

Inventive, fun, delicious. Obviously. Here's what we had, rated from 1 to 3 stars: Barbeque Pork Belly Sandwiches, Slaw*** Marrow Bone, Chimichurri, Caramelized Onions*** Pig Tails, "Buffalo Style", Celery, Ranch*** Panna Cotta, Saba*** Veal Brains, Vadouvan, Apple Sauce, Carrot** Balsamic Pork Ribs, Delicata Squash, Apple, Pecan** Quail Fry, Grits, Chard, Slab Bacon, Maple Jus** Grilled Octopus, Chorizo, Chowchow** Foie Gras Loco Moco, Quail Egg, Spam, Hamburger** Grilled Mozzarella, Country Ham, Raymundo's Tomatillo Salsa* Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar, S&P Anglaise* The hands down best dish for most of us at the table was the pork belly sliders. Ridiculously good. I personally also loved the marrow with chimichurri, and the pig tails because they were just fun. The veal brains were surprisingly mild. Just sorta tasted like vadouvan and bread crumbs. The texture was also pretty subtle... not what I was expecting. I also normally don't like dessert but the panna cotta was so light and tasty I could eat a bowl of it. (On the side of my bowl of pork belly and coleslaw.) I want to go back and get those pork belly sliders as well as try the pig ear's because they looked super good. There were really too many things to choose from. Overwhelming, but worth the stress of deciding. ***With all these animal products, when I read that "chowchow" was an ingredient in the octopus... and the chorizo looked more beefy than chorizo normally does.... i was slightly concerned we may in fact be eating little bits of Chow Chow dogs. Thank god for Google, so I could figure out that chowchow is actually a Southern relish. Phew! Close one.***

THE CLOGGIES: OFFICIAL NOMINEE I've decided to create my own award: The Cloggies.  These awards will go to the most decadent, heart-stopping, life-span-shortening homages to deliciousness that have crossed my tongue over the course of the year.   High up on the list of favorites: Animal's foie gras loco moco.   To the uninitiated, a loco moco is a Hawaiian delicacy/monstrosity consisting of two scoops of rice, topped with two massive hamburger patties, topped with two eggs, topped with a deluge of brown gravy.  To lighten things up you get a healthy salad on the side.  Just kidding.  It's macaroni salad with boatloads of mayo. Animal's version is just so wrong, it's right.  Think rice, hamburger, SPAM(!), FOIE GRAS(!!!), and quail egg surrounded by a fiery pearl necklace of Sriracha.  I really would love to meet the sick individual who decided to  pair the most decadent of meats with the most maligned.  Pure genius.   This was definitely one of the best things I've eaten all year P.S.  I take back what I said about bacon in dessert.  The bacon chocolate crunch bar rocks.

Came with 2 others on a Sunday evening. Had reservations so no waiting was involved. On to our dishes in order that they came: 1. Rabbit sausage - Had a rustic taste to it, which I enjoyed. I rarely get the opportunity to eat rabbie so this was a treat. 2. Pork belly sliders - I love greasy porky dishes, and this one hit the spot. I don't think I need the slaw, but always good to have some veggies with your fat pork. 3. Marrow bone - It's like eating brain. Very squishy but very flavorful. Pretty much a spread for their good bread (I'm a poet). 4. Grilled octopus - This was the extra dish we ordered since we were not full and we only had one dish left. It was a decent choice although it was my least favorite. The octopus was not chewy but really really cooked well, which I think was the intent. Not my style of octopus. 5. Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - You know why I remember the full name of this dish? Because this dish was the perfect ending to my meal, and then some. It was so good. I put the first bite into my mouth...and I was in heaven. It was salty, sweet, warm, and not heavy at all. The only regret I have with this dish is that I didn't order one for just myself. Next time. We talked to the waiter after the last dish, and he said it was planned that the Foie gras came last. He/They knew it would be the ultimate end of a great meal. Boy was he right.

If you love rich, delicious, quality-animal meat in all of your dishes, then Animal is the place for you. My boyfriend and I went here for our 4 year anniversary and had the following animals: Octopus Rabbit Ox Beef Foie Gras (duck liver) Quail Catfish King Crab At one point, we counted 4 animals in one bite (for his foie gras loco moco). This place is not for the weak of stomach or for vegetarians. HENCE THE NAME, people. I highly recommend the poutine if you're in the mood for something rich, delicious, and with high-quality oxtail gravy. I'll be back when my cholesterol goes down!

WOW!  This place is for the adventurous only.  If you have friends who pick at food and won't eat this or that do not take them here BUT if you have friends who trust chefs to give you wonderful amazing dishes this is the place! I LOVE the food here.  You walk into a sparsely decorated white box with high ceilings of a room.  In fact it has a non existent decor. Just the wooden tables and chairs, which is perfect because the food is all you need! Started with the Chicken Liver toast, a creamy deliciousness. Pigs Ear, with Chili Lime and fried egg, a good balance tart spicy. Bone Marrow with Chimmichurri sauce, rich and decadent with the chimmichurri to round out the overly richness of it and bring it back down to earth so you can spread more and more on your toast. Fois Gras, biscuit,  Maple sausage gravy, the piece de la resistance! no words, no words can really truly describe this masterpiece. Just too good, let me just say I was sad when it was gone yet happy at the same time because I knew if I had anymore i might get gout.  We were going to order dessert after this perfect dish but we decided against it because we wanted to savor that oh so wonderful heaven in our mouth and make the flavor last. Oh I had some good beers too ginga kogan, and a pumkin ale.  They were both fantastic! The service was great, always bring clean dishes and food came out very quickly.  Just as a side note, my stomach is growling just thinking about the meal last night, it is telling to go back and feed me more deliciousness..... ugh, must go back soon give into it's wishes.

I'm back again. This time with a large group, so we can try the entire menu. Some dishes I ate were: 1. marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions ($9) - a must order 2. pig tails, "buffalo style", celery, ranch ($11) 3. barbeque pork belly sandwichs, slaw ($12 for 2 sliders) - a must order 4. pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg ($12) - a must order 5. albacore tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut ($14) - a must order 6. grilled octopus, chorizo, chowchow ($15) 7. rabbit loin, country ham, succotash salad ($14) 8. panna cotta, saba, strawberries ($7) All of the dishes were still pretty damn good.... enough said.

One insomniac night while flipping through the channels, I came across the Food Network's latest segment, "Best Thing I Ever Ate...with bacon."  Intrigued, I began to watch and was mesmerized by Duff's (from Ace of Cakes) recommendation of the Chocolate Bacon Crunch Bar at Animal.  Months after my mental note, I finally had a chance to check it out this past weekend.   If it wasn't for the physical address, we would have missed the unmarked restaurant over and over again (located a few stores down from Canter's)!  Walking in without a reservation, we waited about 45 minutes before being able to grab a couple seats by the bar.  Doing research prior to arrival, the fella and I ordered some starred dishes recommended by fellow Yelpers Darin L. & Oanh N.   Barbecue Pork Belly Sandwiches - I almost never pass up the opportunity to connoisseur pork belly...and I don't plan to start now!  Each component of the sandwich was delectable on its own but was superb when combined.  The bread was fluffy and carried a lingering, buttery undertone per bite.  The pork belly was AMAZING!  Pan seared on the outside, fatty and moist on the inside - one of the best I've had to date!  Animal did these pork belly pieces justice by serving two large chunks per slider with a careful drizzle of BBQ sauce to avoid over-drenching.  What else can be added to complete this masterpiece?  A small, refreshing bed of coleslaw to lighten the bite.     Foie Gras Loco Moco - If it wasn't for the rave reviews on this dish, I would have hesitated to order the loco moco due to the indicated foie gras.  Not much of a duck fan, I decided to put that difference aside for the night and give this dish a try.  Animal gave this Hawaiian signature dish a positive twist by including a layer of foie gras into the tower.  This conjured remix was absolutely decadent!  I especially appreciate the hints of spiciness contributed by the drops of hot sauce in the gravy and from the diced scallions.  Different flavors and textures burst with each bite, teasing your taste buds of what's to come. Chocolate Bacon Crunch Bar - The highly anticipated crunch bar consisted of layers of rich, dark chocolate with hints of hazelnut, topped with crushed bacon bits.  I enjoyed the contrasting juggle between sweet and salty, but was slightly disappointed by the weak contrast coming from the salty portion. We thoroughly enjoyed our entire meal and yearned to order more as we gained visual of what our neighboring patrons were ordering.  Maybe we'll give the pig ears a try next time!

Loved it. Shared plates tapas-style. Wine, halibut, petit basque with chorizo, veal brains - all were excellent. Service was good and the food was presented cleanly. The only complaint I would lodge is that it seemed like every person in the place was shouting nonstop. More a consequence of the small space than anything else, I'd guess.

Loved it!! Went here for a first date. Great food, great ambiance. Can get a bit packed so reservations are preferable. A bit different from your average menu, but if you're into trying something new I suggest this. There food was delicious. I almost ate everything in sight from the beet salad to the pork belly sandwiches to the bone marrow. Can't wait to try Son of A Gun.

Amazing experience. One of my top 5. I was going to deduct a star because of decor and ambiance, but realized the food made up for it. We were 4 of us, Saturday night early seating (reservations made 3 weeks in advance). Started with chicken liver and it was delicious. Even liver hater husband liked it. Plus, for $3 a pop you can't go wrong. Next, foie gras and veal tongue. Tongue had pastrami spices and melted in your mouth. Terrine was velvety and complimented the veal really well. Our "2nd" course were pork belly sandwiches and oxtail poutine. Both excellent. BBQ sauce and slaw had the perfect balance, and the meat was soft and tasty. Everyone loved the poutine. It's a crowd pleaser and I highly recommend. Balsamic pork ribs were good, but a tad acidic for my taste. Pig's ear was my least favorite dish of the night. I won't order that again. Foie gras loco moco was to die for. I have a foie gras fetish,  and this dish satisfied my craving for the day.  I would order that just for myself. We finished with the bacon chocolate bar, wow, delicious. I'm not a dessert person, but this one is a must have. Our server was great, but I have  to mention, the have the most efficient bus boys in their staff. Without being in your face, service was attentive, and overall great.

everything was delicious! if you're a foie gras lover you must come here. chicken liver pate - savory, creamy, and rich.  this came on a large crostini and was a generous helping. deelish! bone marrow - very generous portion of marrow.  loved the toast that came with it.  must order if youre a marrow fan. foie gras loco moco - it's actually smaller than it appears in pictures.  who knew that foie gras went so well with spam, egg, and a hamburger patty? the foie absolutely MADE this dish.  this wasnt too rich and was delicious on all levels.  loveee!

Ventured to Animal for a good-bye dinner of one of my foodie friends. Sad to see him go, but he's off to NY .... with even more amazing food! When we walked in, it was smaller than I thought it would be. The decor was simple, yet had a bit of elegance to it. It's a great place to bring a date (especially a carnivorous one) if you want to impress them. Our group decided to go family style and ordered eight things off the menu to share. Some of my favorites and must haves (until they change their menu): - BBQ pork belly sliders: I'm a huge huge fan of barbeque pork. The pork belly was very tender and had a nice crispy smoky crust. Very delectable, I highly recommend it. - Bone marrow, chimichurri with onions: Oh my goodness, this was possibly my favorite dish of the night. It comes with toast and you can spread the marrow on it like butter. It was flavorful, - A Foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger: They nailed this one. The foie gras was amazing, buttery and tender. It went well with the loco moco. We shared this among 7 people. I don't really recommend getting one on your own unless you can handle all the flavor and density. This plate is very very heavy, but incredible. Spam and hamburger went well and their teriyaki sauce that drenched it was amazing! Some other things you should try: - baby kale, pecorino, lemon chili vinaigrette, crouton - pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg For dessert, I really liked their tres leches. Probably the best tres leches I've ever had. It was not too spongy or soggy, was sweet in a good way and came with caramel. Mmmm. Overall, good meal. I'd come here again for sure.

This is my go-to recommendation for out-of-towners.  It is a temple of indulgence.  Some dishes are too rich, or too sweet, or too ______, but it doesn't matter because everything is SO D*** good that I wouldn't risk changing a thing.  i.e. the foie gras biscuit with maple syrup gravy is too rich and too sweet.  But it is so freaking delicious.  So who cares.  Just take a lipitor when you get home. Not that into the bacon chocolate bar.

Great stuff. Is it worthy of the hype? Probably not. People seem to liken this place to some sort of holy temple of offal.  But its honestly a very solid restaurant in a city notorious for the ficklest of restaurant goers.   I'm not a fan of gamey types of foods and offal, but they do a good job making it quite tasty for the masses of hipsters that frequent this joint.  The service is always great, with the waiters guiding you through the menus.  Did the usual suspects, make sure you get some of the kale to cut through the fat/grease/foie. I absolutely love their poutine, the oxtail and gravy from it is just perfectly savory and the foie gras loco moco....just wow. I did not expect a piece of foie that size on there. I love that they are open really late. When you're hungry and its midnight, its nice to know you can get some really high end food and won't have to suffer at the hands of Jerry and his Deli (although they are next to the reasonable and classic Canters).

I've heard and read a lot of good things about this restaurant and it didn't disappoint! There's no sign outside of the building so just look for the address. Foie gras, biscuit, and maple sausage gravy- absolutely amazing. This was hands down everyone's favorite dish of the night. Bone marrow, chimichurri, caramelized onions- my first time eating bone marrow and it was pretty good. Hamachi tostada- yum! It was so fun to eat too. I loved the crunchy shell and soft chewy fish combined. Pork bell sliders- amazing, must try! rabbit with gnocchi- wasn't bad but compared to the others, not very memorable We also got a dish with some kind of brain. I don't remember which type of animal it came from. It tasted gooey and even though it didn't taste bad, I'm not a fan because all I can think of is that I'm eating brain. Not gonna lie though, I was a little disappointed when it wasn't served in a monkey head bowl... ;) We ordered all 4 of the desserts on the menu but I only remember 3 of them, bacon chocolate crunch bar, creme brulee, and carrot cake. I was expecting to love the bacon chocolate crunch bar, but unfortunately, I didn't like it at all.

Always innovative with an ever changing menu, this place will satisfy the most gregarious of foodies. Bring or order a big red, order a bunch of different dishes, and enjoy the multitude of complex flavors. Getting a table on short notice is difficult, but if you are dying to try it now, show up at 6pm and b line to the bar where the seating isn't reserved. Servers are great. William is the man.

The flavors and the food were so awesome...even if the hostess was a total and utter douche about whether or not we were entitled to sit in an empty restaurant - because we didn't have a reservation. I've had the following: barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw. money. hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut. money. foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy. money berries, vanilla custard, lavender crumble, opal basil. money baby kale, pecorino, lemon chili vinaigrette, crouton veal brains, with sumac - Not for the unadventurous (my favorite) foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger -IN-Effing-credible Their house wine is great considering that it is about $30 cheaper than any other bottle on the menu.

Oh your God. I've been anxiously awaiting an opportunity to go to Animal since I heard of it six months ago. Two things gave me pause. One, it's fairly exotic fare and I have to be in a daring mood. Two, I'm cheap. But this week when a friend solicited my company to go and check it out, it seemed like too good an opportunity, and I accepted. We arrived 30 minutes early, and were promptly seated anyway. Bonus points, Animal, you're off to a good start. We ordered a carafe of gewurztraminer and toasted to humpday. It was a nice fairly dry wine, yet flavorful and cold and refreshing. Happiness. My dining companion ordered for the two of us. I was intimidated by some of the suggestions, tempted to say no way, Jose (literally), but held off and let him run with it. Hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinagrette, with peanut... awesome beginning, it was delicious and fresh and exciting and really set the tone for the rest of the meal. Ricotta ravioli with lemon, basil, pecorino, and olive oil... the least impressive dish tonight, still delicious, but delicious in a common way. It paled in comparison to the other dishes, still an A- anywhere else. The balsamic pork ribs with cherry tomato & cucumber panzanella... best ribs I've had in life. Can't really say more. They were amazing. Flat iron steak with artichoke hash with truffle parmesan fondue... twice as good as the second best steak I've had. Quote to my friend when I took a bite: "This steak is to good that I want to give it my phone number and wait for it to call me tomorrow...". That good. I expect to have dreams about it. Probably tonight. Tres leches cake was the best I've had. Bacon chocolate crunch bar with salt and pepper anglaise... so weird yet DAMN good. This is my new favorite restaurant in LA... I want to be taken there for my birthday, if anyone's reading this. Truth.

Spam. spam, spam, spam, spamityy, spam! I confess, I did not have any spam when I went to Animal, but how could I resist? Memorable meal. It's been reviewed by everyone, so I have nothing new to add. A bottle of house wine, a charming waiter, even more charming dining companion = pretty darn close to perfect. The meat coma the next two days was also memorable. I'm serious, my brain and body did not function.

Animal is so bomb! The ambience is amazing. Really chill and very modern masculine. Their menu is all about MEAT. Be sure to try the Pork Sliders and Ox Tail Poutine. Probably the best Poutine you'll find in LA. The Fred Flinstone Slab Steak for 2 is massive. Like seriously... It was half of the cow. So pace yourself. Great for late night eats but be sure to call ahead or make a ressy. It gets pretty booked on the weekends.

Can I just say WOWZERZ?!?! The food is exceptional. Tapas style so you're supposed to order a couple of plates. I went with my mom who lives nearby so we walked, otherwise I wouldn't know where in the hell to park. We didn't make reservations so we had to sit at the bar (which has about 7 seats) and it wasn't bad at all. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY is definitely their philosophy. Started off with the barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw and the meat was tender and flavorful, each bite was delish! I'd have to say that the pork belly at Animal is better than anything I've had from a regular bbq restaurant. We also had hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette with peanut. The tostada was crispy, the hamachi was tasty and lemony. The peanut added a nice flair, definitely different. We ended with the chocolate bacon crunch bar and tres leches slice of cake. Both desserts were DIVINE and DECADENT! The bar is similar to a kit kat but bigger: don't let the chocolate with bacon fool you, there are tiny bits of bacon in the creamy chocolate. The tres leches cake was moist and perfectly sweet. Make reservations or sit at the bar if you're walking in, it's a small place.

Sometimes, the Yelp ratings have let me down, but not this case. I've passed by Animal many times and never knew it because there isn't a sign on the restaurant.  It is near Canter's on Fairfax.  The place was smaller than I had expected, but I like the modern vibe.  Patrons are casually dressed, so you don't have to get dressed up if you don't want.  Luckily for me, it was a friend's birthday, so it was a good time to order several dishes and share.  Based on Yelp reviews the must try items  were: 1) Pork belly sliders 2) Oxtail poutine We also ordered: 1) Foie gras w/ biscuits 2) pig ears 3) rabbit loins 4) steak 5) bone marrow The portions at Animal are more tapas style, which makes it cool to try a bunch of stuff and share it friends.  We shared a few bottles of wine and ended our meal with sharing an order of the bacon chocolate bar. For a party of 8, we had to two of everything and it was enough to leave us satisfied. The group liked the sliders and the poutine (Canadian style fries with gravy, oxtail, and cheese curds) the best.  The others were good too, but the foie gras was a bit too sweet for peoples' taste.   Dinner at the Animal was awesome for a sophisticated dinner with friends.  Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating, which is refreshing for this side of town.  I would love to come back.

Tasty! Love trying new dishes every time I go. Its necessary to make sure you put a bit of everything in your mouth from a dish to get what they are trying to say. The only negative thing I have to say is now the chocolate bacon bar is served with Salt n Pepper Ice Cream.... that taste like salt and cream, Kills it. I could see some salt crystals on the plate with a pepper ice cream, but not the overly salted cream.

Animal is the place to go if you want hearty, heavy, deliciously tasting comfort food that doesn't hold back on flavor.  The owners are two dudes who are rumored to be stoners which explains it all.  You'll leave feeling full for hours but gluttony is definitely worth it there.  The restaurant is pretty tiny so reservations are highly recommended.  I went there with a group of six girls to celebrate a birthday and we all loved it. What we ordered: baby kale, pecorino, lemon chili vinaigrette, crouton marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar balsamic pork ribs, delicata squash, arugula, pecan grilled octopus, chorizo, spicy brown mustard, chowchow foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy berries, vanilla custard, lavender crumble, opal basil sticky toffee pudding, mascarpone, orange tres leches, dulce de leche bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise Everything we ordered on the menu was a hit. The baby kale is the best kale salad I've ever had.  The marrow bone was perfectly cooked and full of flavor.  The lettuce salad was amazing for just having a few ingredients.  The bbq pork belly sandwiches were filled with juicy chunks of pork belly.  The hamachi tostada, which was a favorite amongst us all, was spicy and unlike any tostada I've ever tasted.  The balsamic ribs were sweet and tangy and they went perfectly with the squash and arugula.  The poutine was super rich and tasty.  The grilled octopus was cooked perfectly and the chorizo was delicious.  The last, but not least, dish that came out was the foie gras with biscuit and gravy...this...was...yummy!! It was very heavy but we all shared one order and a bite was the perfect amount to start off our dessert tasting.   We ordered every dessert. My favorite was the tres leches but they were all delicious. They only complaints I have is that they only serve beer and wine to wash down the food. It would've been great if they had specialty drinks to go with the menu.   Also, the bacon chocolate crunch bar was kind of a disappointment.  It was a piece of chocolate with tiny bits of bacon in it. I thought it was going to have more of a bacon influence.

How do I even begin? Animal is...different. First and foremost, the menu is unlike anything i've ever seen. So much interesting stuff and you almost KNOW it's all going to be delicious. And yes, this place lives up to all its hype! It's simple inside, nothing crazy but yet the restaurant has a very fun/nice vibe. Tip: It's not easy to spot on the street, it's just north of Canters on Fairfax. Our waiter was alright, service was good and the food...well, THE FOOD WAS AMAZING. Let me break it down for you! chicken liver toast - this was very...liver'y. but for someone who doesn't like liver normally, it was pretty good. good flavor, consistency wasn't too tough to handle at all lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac  - AMAZING. so so so fresh and yummy and delightful. much needed veggie-based dish since we were going so heavy on everything else pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg - i am asian and grew up on pig ear so this didn't scare me. it was prepared VERY well, VERY tasty (pretty spicy!) and the fried egg was the perfect topping. VERY GOOD (and you can smell it from a mile away WOOT!) barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw - HELLO DELICIOUSNESS! this was SUPER bomb. you expect it to be good (b/c, when iSNT pork belly NOM) but this is especially good. i believe we referred to the sauce as CRACK! :) poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar  - this came highly recommended from our friend who loves animal and wow, it was one of our favorites of the evening. rich, delicious and filling! striped bass, creamed spinach, caper brown butter - WHO KNEW I COULD LIKE FISH THIS MUCH! this was surprisingly DELIGHTFUL. actually, this may have been one of my favorite dishes. SUPERB. sticky toffee pudding, mascarpone, orange - awesome. super. duper. delicious. get. it. NOW. house wine - $20 bucks a bottle. bomb. need i say more? We went with 5 girls and sharing everything turned out perfectly. Of course more poutine and pork belly noms would have been demolished...but actually, portions and everything was perfect! Also of note, we made reservations the morning of (oops!) and were told that we wouldn't be able to be seated until 930pm. We called around 8 and they were able to squeeze us in! Awesome. Overall, SUPER DUPER. Totally recommend Animal for adventurous eaters and really, anyone who appreciates GOOD FOOD!

Animal is a place for those who don't fear the unusual. I sometimes do. Animal made is painless. I went here about 2 years ago (Better late to review than never). I was on a first date, and before the date I told him I loved to try new things, which I did...but I guess escargots are just for beginners. The decor at Animal is quaint, it's not a huge place, and it's not overly done...but the lighting and the light interior is refreshing. After all...it's all about the food. The waiter was friendly and very attentive and suggest a very good chardonnay for me. The menu...for someone like me...scary...but exciting. I was safe, and ordered the steak. My boyfriend ordered pork belly sliders and the rabbit legs. Two things I have never tried...until Animal. DELICIOUS. Everything we ate was perfectly cooked, and had the perfect flavors. I was worried about the rabbit being too gamy, but it was so tender and melted in my mouth. I definitely want to come back and maybe push my palette farther... Hey babe...if you're reading my reviews: Anniversary dinner? ;)

I have been looking at this place for quite some time and decided that it was time to try Animal out. The place itself doesn't have a sign or any special markers to let you know you're at the restaurant so jus look for a blank building a couple doors up from Canters. The inside looks very dull, with nothing on the walls, but for some reason it suites the place. Our waiter was a real nice guy and asked if it was our first time at Animal. Since it was, he suggested that we order 4-5 items for the 2 of us since the are small portions. (they weren't kidding about the small part) 1st order: lamb neck, nettle, fava bean, daikon, black vinegar jus The lamb neck was ver tender to the point where all we needed was a butter knife to cut it. The black vinegar jus gave the lamb an extra kick. 2nd order: rabbit sausage, morels, english peas, ricotta gnocchi Never had rabbit before and after this dish it will definitely not be the last. This was my second favorite dish of the night. 3rd order: Crispy pigs head It was  small piece of battered pork, but I never knew that such a small piece of meet cold pack a punch of taste. I completely forgot what else was on this dish but the dressing did compliment the pork 4th order: thai bbq quail, scallion, citrus, cashew, yogurt By far my favorite dish of the night!!!! The cashews and citrus went really well with the quail. The quail its self tasted awesomely!!! (my own word) I just wish quail wasn't so small cuz i would've loved to have more. It was jus that good Animal is a good experience and the food is awesome!!!! The only reason Im giving it 4 starts is because I wish the portions were larger. After sharing 4 dishes we were still hungry. Am I glad I came here yes, was the food tasty, yes. Would I go out of my way to come here again, no. For me the money really wasn't worth it, but if someone wants a real nice restaurant to go to, with good food then I will definitely come here again

After reading and hearing so many great reviews from friends and yelpers, we knew we had to try.  Located on Fairfax, this place is hidden with no signs out front (minus the street number) and the decor is very minimal.  They do have a heater out front for guests that are waiting to be seated.  However, this thing was on full blast and it probably was in the upper 60's that night.  Needless to say, I was hot and had to stand on the sidewalk.  The place is dimly lit which offers a great ambience.  We had a party of 5 so we did order quite a bit of food.  We also brought 2 bottles of wine for the table.   The food: Hamachi tostada (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  This dish had a good flavor, but since we only ordered one, I wasn't sure if I even got a piece of hamachi.  At the bottom of the pile was the tostada which added a nice crunch to the little bit I had.  It also had a nice little kick to it. Baby kale (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  I did like the lemon chili vinaigrette which the kale was tossed in which was light.  However, I don't think I like the bitterness from the kale. Grilled octopus w/ chorizo (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  The octopus was perfectly cooked, however I wished the chorizo would've been better if it was crispier instead of something that tasted mushy.  I believe we only got 3-4 pieces of octopus and ended up sharing a piece with the gf.  I think Mozza's octopus still ranks as my all time favorite. BBQ pork sliders (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  I think this was one of the best dishes we had that night.  The pork belly was tender and had a slight crispy texture (perhaps pan fried?).  The BBQ sauce wasn't too tangy and is a definite must have when dining here.  If we didn't order so much food, I would've opted for another 1-2 of these bad boys.   Bone marrow w/ chimichurri and caramelized onions (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  I actually think the chimichurri and caramelized onion sauce overpowered the bone marrow flavor.  Couldn't really taste the bone marrow though I could see it on my piece of bread.  I think I prefer bone marrow with just a dash of sea salt and perhaps some roasted garlic to spread onto the bread.  I think Pizzeria Mozza's bone marrow takes the win. Melted petite basque (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  This dish was good, but I think I'll skip this dish next time around.  I really couldn't taste nor see the chorizo.  Then again it was dark in the restaurant. Poutine w/ oxtail gravy  and cheddar(http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  Oh do I love oxtail, and this dish was another one of the favorites for the night.  I love my fries extra crispy and would've liked mine a bit crispier but I do understand that once you throw on gravy, everything gets soggy.  A very tasty dish that was satisfying and we had enough so that I got seconds.  Will definitely order again next time. Foie gras, bisquit, and maple sausage gravy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  The bisquit was nice and fluffy and the foie gras was seared perfectly.  However, the maple sausage gravy was waaaay too sweet for me.  I understand how a little sweetness enhances the foie gras but damn that maple sausage gravy was almost as sweet as a dessert. Foie gras loco moco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  If loco moco wasn't already good enough with a piece of spam underneath, they add a hearty chunk of foie gras on top!  This was my favorite dish for the night!  A definite must try when dining here.  The terriyaki sauce and sriracha add a nice sweet and spicy flavor to the already awesome combination of spam, hamburger meat, and foie gras. Flat iron steak (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  Wasn't overly impressed with this dish as the parmesan fondue sauce tasted a little weird with the steak.  Creative I must say, but didn't pair well in my opinion with the steak.   Radicchio salad w/ pear and persimmon salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  Didn't have any as I was stuffed (http://www.yelp.com/biz_… am not much of a salad kinda guy.  Heard it was ok though. Tres leche select=aMT1vNqg3IreKzlgrtMZVA).  Decent, but I think I prefer my tres leche from Portos. Sticky toffee pudding (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  This was only so so...definitely was not impressed.

Cool looking place with cool looking servers and a menu that reads like hipster foodie porn. All the cooks have tats and wear bandanas, the servers all double (I'm sure) as cage dancers somewhere dark, and the menu I got had grease marks and looked like it had been to battle. You will find super neat menu items like pig tails, rabbit legs and poutine, along with a beer and wine list that contains nothing you've ever heard of (which is considered super-cool, in case you didn't know). Unfortunately, the dishes I ate did not meet the high standards set by the rest of the place. And, given the nature of this restaurant, I'm sure the chef would agree that everything hinges on the food. The chicken liver toast was tasty. Top notch. That I'll give them. The pig tails, though interesting and delicious (heavy, but delicious), were also greasy and stringy. Balsamic pork ribs and panzanella sounds great, right? Sadly, not so much. Edible, certainly, but HEAVY. With every bite I could hear my arteries screaming out in agony. The flavor of the ribs, furthermore, lacked acidity and zing, and fell flat in the face of such heavy fattiness. And one pet peeve to air here: I love panzanella (bread salad), but greens with a few small pieces of bread thrown in does not a panzanella make. Though it doesn't sound as cool on a menu, that would be called salad with croutons. The flavors in this salad were delicious, let it be said, but it was not by any stretch a panzanella. I'm sure the place really deserves four stars, but that panzanella thing really got to me, and in the end I could not overcome the disappointment of the food in the face of such an impressive setting. But it is certainly cool, and you should go. Dress appropriately.

This place has no cons! Great food and great service. I tried the following items: marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onion pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw sweetbreads, creamed spinach, capers, oyster mushrooms hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, pea Everything was delicious and tasty. Even though this place is $$$, I definitely want to come back to their other items. Helpful hints: -Make reservations!!! -You can only be 15 mins late to your reservation. -Good for 2-4 people. -If you bring your own wine, $20 cork fee. -Meter parking, but also close to residential parking. -4-5 plates are satisfying unless you are really hungry, order more!

Not long ago, we dined at Animal. We had a table along the side wall, near the front of the restaurant, from which we could see all of the dishes being delivered to other parts of the restaurant, and everything looked mouth-wateringly good. The whole experience was top-notch: great service, wonderful atmosphere, and plate after plate of exquisite meatiness.  We consumed fried quail with bacon, pork belly with kimchi, flat iron steak, mexican shrimp, and their chocolate peanut butter bacon bar. All were delicious, and I can't wait to return.

OH- MY - GOD! This place is AMAZING! When I originally looked at the menu online, I didn't think it was too pricey, but the dishes are about small to medium sized, so you'll need to order at least 2 dishes a person to be full, so it does add up. The food though is AMAZING. Melts in your mouth. Oh my goodness! We got the pig ear (crunchy and yummy), BBQ pork belly (melts in your mouth, just amazing, so good, a must!), hamachi tostada (fresh with a little bit of spiciness), and the rabbit legs (good, but there is probably something better to order). We also got the sticky toffee for dessert, it was the perfect ending. Also melts and just so good. mmmmm.... I would totally go back there for any special occasion!

Came here last night to celebrate a friends birthday. The three of us was totally excited and couldn't wait to finally be able to try this place out after reading so many great reviews. Located right next to the Supreme store, you won't even realized it's there until you double check the address cause there's no sign or anything to point it out. After we entered our excitement slowly turned into a disappointment. Let me first talk about the food. Out the 6 main dishes we got we liked one, loved another one and didn't care for the rest of it. Most of the dishes didn't live up to the hype. At the price we are paying for these dishes it should leave us feeling like its different and that we will not be able to get something like that anywhere else. Sadly, it didn't a lot of the dishes we felt was something we can get cheaper, with a larger portion and probably would taste a lot better at one of the Cafes in the 626 area. We decided to also get dessert and went with the Bacon Chocolate Crunch bar with salt and pepper ice cream. This was probably the most pathetic looking dessert we had ever gotten. We got a slither of the crunch bar, and a small scoop of ice cream. Besides giving us a slither I did have this question, where's the bacon?? The salt and pepper ice cream was blah. It seemed like vanilla ice cream with a hint of salt but no pepper was present. I've seen pictures of the portions others got and that is definantly not what we got. If I was to based this review on just the food alone I might of given this place 3 stars however, this was an overall experience and I have to minus a star for the bad service we got here. When we walked in the hostess didn't welcome or say anything to us until I said we had reservations. A few minutes later we were sitted. She went back to her booth and soon later was playing with her phone. I'm sorry we bothered you and your facebook time but hello your at work so shouldn't you be ummm working?? Anyways,  the tables are fairly close to one another so the chairs for each table barely fit in the space given so you have to kind of move around the chairs and table to fit in between the space that is given. (The side with the booth seating seemed a little roomier.) Where my friend was sitting she got hit about 10 times by either the waiters/waitresses and the hostess. All of them would look back cause they knew they hit her but none of them apologized or say anything just a staredown and then they turn back around and walk off.  After a while of staring at our meny our waitress finally came and asked if it was our first time here. We told her yes and she explained how the dishes worked and what was the recommended amount of dishes to order. The whole time she was explaining she gave us a feeling that she was better than us. She walked away and didn't return until almost 15 minutes later to finally take our order, still showing the same bad attitude. The only person that we felt gave us excellent service was one of the bus boys, he was very tentative and was the only person who said thank you to us when we were leaving. We regretted giving a tip to the waitress, we should have just gave everything to him since his the only one we felt who deserved it.

1st time here... of course i wanted to try this for such a long time esp after the raving reviews by Oanh hahaha... Got the pork belly slider, foie gras biscuit, poutine oxtail cheddar, hamachi, lettuce salad, ravioli, another pork belly slider haha and bone marrow... and all 3 desserts they had on the menu. Everything was good... the ravioli was probably my least fav bc it lacked a flavor. Everyone liked the chocolate bacon at the end but I think I like the other two better, esp the white cake(forgot what it was called) Service was GREAT, changed plates and forks often and attentive but not annoying. Will def come back again soon!

The food is tasty. We tried the pig ears, sweetbreads, potato agnolotti with rabbit sausage, balsamic pork ribs, and the bacon chocolate crunch bar. All yummy but they are a little heavy handed with the vinegar and citrus. Very acidic sauces on the pig ears and ribs. I realize balsamic ribs means acid but it could use some mellowing out. Regardless, the pig ears were my favorite! The chocolate bar is rich and delicious but you can't really taste the bacon...which I was sad about. Again, still yummy!   They have awesome napkins that have a button hole so you can connect it to your top shirt button! I thought that was cute. The restaurant is a little too dimly lit in the middle row of tables so sit next to the wall if you want to see your company

Still my favorite restaurant in LA! Nothing else even comes close. Every time a friend comes into town from NYC, I try to show them that LA has great food too. And every time I take anyone to Animal, they LOVE it! It's not food that you can eat every day since it's pretty heavy, but I need to get my fix at least once a month! What you must get: 1. Fois gras loco moco 2. BBQ pork sandwiches 3. Poutine with oxtail gravy 4. Hamachi Tostada 5. Grilled Octopus I feel like if you haven't been to Animal, then you're not a real foodie. At least in my book ;)

Some friends have been wanting to try out Animal for a long time so we finally went, but the only open reservation was 10:30 at night. So by the time we arrived we were all starving! For 6 we ordered 4- chicken liver toast, 1- foie gras loco moco, 2- bone marrow, 3-bbq pork belly sandwiches, 2- flat iron, and then every single dessert with some other dishes.  It was a great amount for some tapa style of food but did not fill us up.  Everything was absolutely delicious, the food came out with perfect timing.  The only negative thats holding me back for a 5 star is that I wanted more of everything and for being how we spent $45/person and not being full it didn't make me too happy. But its perfect for a group of friends when they want to relax and enjoy a couple tapa style items, not a place when your hungry. Food - * * * * * Ambiance - * * * * * Service - * * * Price - * * *

After reviewing a significant amount of fun, highly reviewed, unique spots I decided upon Animal as a birthday treat for my boyfriend since he is always down to try something new. Pig ears, pigtails, bone marrow...as he always says, "Stupid not to!" With this in mind, I quickly set up a reservation and was happy we got a spot for two on a Friday night as the hostess informed me it is sometimes tricky to arrange due to the popularity and small 45 seat size of the restaurant. *Tucked away along the lovely Fairfax Avenue, make sure you don't miss the restaurant as it is unmarked and very easy to overlook. Pros & Grows... Pros: + Unique menu + Enjoyed the Oxtail Putin, Pigtails, Pig ears, and marrow bone + Intimate environment (although a little loud) + Good beer & wine menu + Menu (changes daily) Grows: - Service - Portion sizes Conclusion: It a good first time experience and a fun spot to wine & dine for a birthday but we both are not moved to go back... Similarly to when I have traveled and sampled cow intestines and heart, crickets, chicken gizzard and many other unique parts of various animals, I am content with "been there done that."   Will still recommend it as an eclectic place to go but I can't say that I will be a regular here.

I feel sorry for the restaurant that we went to the night before (The Lazy Ox) because Animal was pretty spectacular and now I can't think of any place but Animal. First: Great wine list. They have a sparkling wine from the Jura. Cool. What did we have? - Poutine oxtail (fries with oxtail gravy on top (was there cheese? I don't recall)) - Grilled octopus (delicious - when octopus is done well it is one of my favorite things) - Chicken livers - Pigs ear, lime, fried egg - Two (or three?) orders of bone marrow - Foie gras with a biscuit covered in maple gravy (oh my) I feel like I am forgetting something. The staff was excelent. Cool space (although in LA, I think they call it 'rustic'). Ha. I will be back.

Good, but didnt blow my mind. I came here for my birthday dinner and even with a reservation, we had to wait almost 40 minutes to get seated. The waiter was pretty nice, but he didn't seem to have much patience with us when it came to giving us recommendations. I forgot to warn my friends that this place serves "exotic" animal parts (which i love!!!!!!) so we had to compromise a bit on what we ordered. I had to try the foie gras with biscuit and gravy... but passed on the loco moco this time. The foie gras was so good and fluffy and fatty and delicious!!!! The biscuit was very sweet and the gravy was very flavorful (maybe even a bit too much for my taste). I was done after a few bites (I havent been able to eat anything fatty after I overdosed on toro and wagyu beef one day....), but my friends were more than happy to devour the rest. We ordered the char-shui quail with peaches and apples. This was a solid dish... quail was cooked just right. However,I could not stop thinking of the freaking amazing quail(s) I had at Ink a few nights before. MV's dish ended up overshadowing this one. My unadventurous friends got the pork belly sliders with slaw. Good and filling... but I found the pork to be quite dry on some pieces. My gluten-free friend ended up just getting the heriloom tomatoes with olives. Tasty but shouldn't have counted as an entree. :( (sigh.. I shouldve realized that there's almost no gluten free foods on the menu...). I forgot to mention earlier that we got some chicken liver toast for the meal as well! The liver pate was good... very very livery!!!! Again, I was full after a few bites..... too fatty/flavorful to eat it all..... We got a tres leches cake for dessert and this was delicious! :) I love tres leches (only when it isn't super sweet) and this one was everything I expected and more. This was good experience. I wish I went with a more adventurous group though. I want to try the pig ears, pig tails, rabbit, bone marrow, pigs head still!! I'll definitely come back again. This time, I hope we can get seated more promptly and the waiter can treat us more like "real" customers. Also, we were seated next to obnoxious (and drunk) middle aged women who kept laughing and talking loudly during the meal. Seemed like the entire restaurant was disturbed by their behavior, yet nothing was done about it. Oh well, better luck next time? I think so....

Me and my lady have wanted to come to this place for a long time. I finally grew some man spheres and decided to set a reservation. Good. Menu is all over the place, but everything sounds interesting. Had the.. Foie Gras with Biscuit and maple gravy (amazing, savory sweetness. I could honestly drink a gallon of that gravy, but i would die of fatness) Short ribs (they were just.. okay...) Quail with citrus salad (very bright and acidic flavors. it worked) Flat Iron with sunchoke hash and fondue sauce (this was the star. the next time i go, and there will be a next time, i will not share this with my lady) Bacon bar was a downer Tres Leches cake was a big surprise.

3 1/2 stars for the interesting dishes and the cute server. -1/2 star for driving past the restaurant 5 times only to realize it was the place that didn't have a sign on it. -1 star for feeling like I just ate a bunch of expensive fried and fatty food and might not wake up the next day. Dishes my friend and I ordered: pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg - I love pig ears and eat them all the time at Chinese restaurants. However, I've never had them the way Animal served them. The flavor of the lime was too strong, but mixing the fried egg with the pig ear made it delish! thai bbq quail, scallion, citrus, cashew, yogurt - this would be my favorite dish. If only the quail was the size of a chicken. Yum yum. rabbit legs, mustard, bacon, sugar snap peas, black trumpet - I dunno what kind of rabbits they used but these rabbit legs were pretty big. It was kinda like eating fried chicken except the meat of the rabbit legs had a different texture. It went well with the mustard and the sugar snap peas took a little getting used to especially since they were raw. barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw - I think when I realized I was eating more fat than meat in this dish, I couldn't enjoy it as much anymore. marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions - this was an interesting dish. The flavor of the chimichurri can be overpowering but I liked it. It's also served with toast. foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - this dish was served last. By then, I was stuffed and wasn't feeling too well after all the fatty food I just ate. Every bite of the foie gras was too rich. I think I would have enjoyed the dish more had it been served earlier. I came out of the restaurant feeling like I literally ate an animal. While I like that Animal serves dishes you don't normally get at other restaurants, I don't think I'll be returning as I don't want to risk having a heart attack next time.

There are times when I reeeally think I could become a vegetarian. Like after you catch that horrific http://TryVeg.com commercial on TV, or when you start hyperventilating over a few flights of stairs, or even times when you see a cute farm animal while driving on the 5. I even made it a month one time without eating any meat. It wasn't that hard. BUT. Animal is a restaurant that confirms that being vegetarian just isn't in the cards for me. The food here is too good.  Even with all the hype surrounding this place, you will still walk away after your meal and think, "yeah, that WAS amazing." My pants were so tight and I almost fell into an instant coma from eating so much but it was worth it.   I love the pork belly sammies, yellowtail tostada salad, and the poutine. Perfect sized portions, amazing flavors (albeit a little unexpected sometimes), and so comforting. I would bet that everything on the menu is great. The service was frustrating but the hostess was super sweet. I'll come back again and again because really...it's about the food. P.S. I snuck a peek at the kitchen on my way to the restroom and saw Vinny Dotolo behind the stove. Kinda rad that he actually still does the cooking.

I won't go down the list of all the things I had since they have a new menu every day.   I like the concept and support the restaurant but I wasn't blown away with the food.  We ordered 7 plates: a mixture of animal MUST HAVES and things that sounded interesting + 2 desserts (the bacon bar and sticky toffee pudding)  The highlights were the buffalo pig tail and crunchy pig ear salad.  I'm a huge sticky toffee pudding fan so if you are expecting a something just like what you'd get in England.. don't order it. Nothing was horrible but if it's a good meal I crave it  months after I've been to the restaurant.   Sorry, but there wasn't a dish I will lay awake at night dreaming about. I will say that Service was great and the atmosphere was very fun. I've heard complaints that animal has acoustic problems and it's often hard to hold a conversation but we didn't have any real problems with this.  Just go in thinking it's more of a bar than fine dining and you'll be fine.

We had an outstanding meal here. 3 of us shared small plates beginning with the chicken liver toast. Every dish was very good, basque cheese, pigs' ear (spicy! be sure you cut up the egg and mix it all up), even the brains (eek!), but the quail was outstanding. Also shared 2 desserts, loved the chocolate bacon with salt & pepper ice cream as well as the berries with vanilla custard and lavender crumble. Service was perfect (thanks, James!)

Probably one of the best dining experiences I have had in Los Angeles. It was a Friday night at 9pm and I was hungry and craving meat. Luckily Animal is open until the ungodly hour of 1am so I made the trek all the way out to Westside. The place is a bit hard to find in the dark because the name of the restaurant is set against black paint and it isn't illuminated. Just look for the Canter's Deli sign (you can't miss it) because it's only a couple of door down. We walked in at 11pm and were immediately sat. But then again, who has dinner at 11pm? Let's start with the service. Our waiter was just OK. He wasn't the nicest person in the world but he took the time to explain how ordering works, portion size, etc. My only complaint is that we found ourselves at time having trouble flagging him down so we could order another beer or glass of wine. For dinner, we decided to split 5 courses: Baby Broccoli with Pancetta, Parmesan & Soft Egg    * I really liked this dish. The baby broccoli was fresh and I really liked the different textures in the dish. The pancetta was slightly overdone though. Bone Marrow with Chimichurri    * Absolutely delicious. I love bone marrow. Chimichurri is one of the most underrated condiments in the world. And the toast you spread both on was just crispy, buttery goodness. Poutine with Oxtail Gravy    * The oxtail meat was beautifully braised. Just melt in your mouth good. It is really heavy though so splitting it between two people actually may be too much. Or at least that's what I thought. Some of my fries tasted like they had spent a little too much time in the fryer though. Balsamic Pork Ribs    * Probably my least favorite dish of the night but mostly because I don't really like ribs or sweet sauce.  In the spirit of full disclosure though, I've never had meat fall off ribs so easily before. Foie Gras Loco Moco    * My favorite dish of the night. The foie gras was everything is should be. Velvety. Buttery. Good. Coupling it with SPAM, the meat of my childhood, seems wrong but its genius. It also comes with hamburger too but much like other reviews, it was overdone. At this point, we were stuffed to the brim so we elected to skip dessert in spite of there being a bacon chocolate bar on the menu. Overall I would give this place a solid four stars. The food was exceptional except for a few overdone items. But the truth of the matter is that I can't eat here all the time. Each individual dish isn't too rich but once you put together five or six items, you start to feel it in your stomach. I would most definitely return though.

We got in without a reservation. A bit difficult to find, no name on the outside. Yes, it's one of those places. The food was unique and delicious. Tapas style, so go with friends and share a couple. I think the menu changes daily but they have some things pretty much all the time. The chefs go off of whatever is available at the farmer's market, so everything is very fresh. We ordered the pork belly sliders. Freakin good. Tender pork, sweet bbq sauce. Had the poutine. Which is Canadian fries topped with cheese and gravy. But they use fatty oxtail gravy at animal which makes it ten times better in my opinion. I could feel my arteries clogging. Hamachi Tostada. Clean, fresh, a little boring. Grilled octopus. Yum. With chorizo, too. Wasn't chewy like it can be at some places. Parking's a bit of a beezy, but there's valet, so not too bad. And I don't see what the fuss about the bacon topped chocolate is about. I thought it was weird. Bacon, okay. Chocolate, good. Together, a bit of a confused mess.

Let's play a game! Marrow bone, Head Cheese, Pig tails, Pig ear?? SWEETBREADS? and Foi gras... hmmm? What do they all have in common? WEIRD ANIMAL PARTS!  Pig ear, pig tails, been there done that? Well... pay close attention to the most "disguised" name such as sweetbreads and head cheese... thymus (throat, gullet, or neck sweetbread) and the pancreas (heart, stomach, or belly sweetbread) and meat jelly made with flesh from the head of a calf or pig? YUMMY!!! Luckily, I am an adventurous eater :)  So we ordered: pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg 12: A little too citrus-y for my taste, but I would have to say it was quite refreshing. poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar 15: Oh my... the oxtail gravy melted in my mouth!  I would have to say that this was my favorite dish of the night! SWEETBREADS, creamed spinach, capers, oyster mushroom 16: Yes yes, its thymus and pancreas... but it tasted like chicken karaage to me~!  It was probably my 2nd favorite dish of the night! Very delicious! foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy 22: A little to sweet for my taste.  When I eat foie gras, I prefer them to be on a bit salty side to go with the buttery taste. barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw 12: Tasty, but... nothing special.  Pulled pork belly sandwiches are to be a bit on a sloppy side, but maybe at some Joe Shmoe's BBQ house, not when I have a dish of Foie Gras coming afterwards. Service was up-to-par.  For a wine lover, I know very little about wine. I wanted a glass of wine, but eek I see like Südtiroler Sauvignon, Mâcon-Fuissé, and Savennières.  There was no simple Chardonnay or Pinot Grigiot...lol I'm not a wine snob ok!  Anyway so I told the waiter to get me whatever he recommends.  He brought about 4 different glasses for me to sample out of and voila~ I picked the Südtiroler Sauvignon and I was happy :) Very small restaurant with a simple décor but I definitely liked the comfortable and cozy atmosphere of the place. I suggest you make a reservation about 3-4 days in advance. Pictures on my blog @ https://risayanai.wordpr…

My favorite restaurant in LA. I've eaten here a bunch, both for dinner and late night (open 'til 2:00am on Fridays and Saturdays!!). I've never had a bad meal here. Actually I've never had anything less than a stellar meal here. The servers are always knowledgeable and friendly. The acoustics are not great (and some may be rubbed the wrong way by the music playing), but what it lacks spatially, it makes up for with amazing food. Their menu changes daily, but here are a spattering of my favorite dishes (that I can remember): Pork Belly Sliders - if you're a pork belly fan, this is a must. Pig Tails - like pork buffalo wings, fabulous! Foie Gras on Biscuit w/ Maple Sausage Gravy - If you're into sweet & savory, this is for you. Possibly my favorite dish at Animal, but not easy on the ol' arteries. Pig Ears w/ Chili, Lime & Fried Egg - I did not know what to expect with this dish, but it blew me away. Tart and crispy, like nothing I've had before or since. Poutine - If this is your thing, or you're just Canadian, you must try this dish. Potato Agnolotti w/ Rabbit Sausage - light fare than most of their dishes. better agnolotti than I've found in most Italian restaurants, these chefs can really do it all! The only downside food-wise is the dessert. The Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar is delicious (yet artery-clogging), but the Tres Leches Cake was overly sweet and certainly not worth ordering. As for their wine list, it is not super extensive, but I found some fantastic pairings as recommended by the servers. This is a restaurant for meat lovers. I would not recommend it to a vegetarian although they have some great salad options. This is the place chefs take their out of town friends. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

ANIMAL: Suck it, Vegans! I can't express enough how much I appreciate the people who created a restaurant with this great concept and make internal organs tasted so out of this world good!   Everything we gotten were fantastic, chicken liver toast, polenta, bone marrow, foie gras maple biscuit, pork belly sliders and choc crunch. New found fav restaurant! Note: Music there sucked, might need to reconsider better music selections. Just saying.

It's no surprise, but being a foodie pretty much guarantees you're a wayfarer of sorts.  But in the myriad of culinary dog and pony shows endlessly popping up in LA, "have food, will travel" simply doesn't cut it anymore.  "Have foie gras bisquits and gravy, will drive the 405 N during rush hour on a Friday" is more like it, and is exactly what influenced the gastronomic nomad out of me, leading me directly to the Canter's stretch of Fairfax to a small restaurant appropriately named ANIMAL. Not surprisingly, ANIMAL is a place to go to appease one's carnal urges towards meat, where those who trim the fat off their steaks need not apply.  It's a place to go where pork fat isn't just a celebrated accoutrement - it's the star of the show.  It's a place to go where expecting to order chicken just won't cut it. ANIMAL is more like a souped-up culinary presentation of the kinds of things made possible when animal parts are deliciously prepared with other delectable items.  Here, you can't be afraid of sweetbreads, which are served up with capers, spinach and hen of the woods (a delicious type of mushroom).  Here, you've got to be open to eating pig ears, which are grilled up with chili and lime and topped with a perfectly fried egg, thereby giving new meaning to a typical breakfast scramble.  And here, you won't want to cringe at the thought of headcheese, rightfully presented along with fried cornbread and vinaigrette, giving an interesting take on something you might find in Cajun cuisine.   But the main event at ANIMAL is really the foie gras bisquits and gravy, and then the kind of things these 2 guys (2 dudes, to be exact http://origin-www.foodne…) can do with pork (ribs, belly, and cheek).  The pork belly sliders, pork belly with kimchi, and the "mouthwatering-meat-falling-off-the-bone" balsamic pork ribs are sure to become a table favorite, while the foie gras bisquits and gravy may just bring a grown man to tears. Overall, go to ANIMAL with a large group of friends, ensuring that you can get a tasting of nearly all the items on the menu.  We sure did.  It'll make for a most excellent fun-filled, fat-laden, cholesterol creation of a night-out-on-the-town in West Hollywood. Note:  Beer and wine only, but corkage is a whopping $20!  Wine list is a bit sparse, but does the job just fine.

If Animal was a woman, this how Edgar would make love to her. For starters, Edgar would use fingers on her poutine, masticating on her delicious and sumptuous oxtail gravy, making sure to appreciate the tangy, salty cheddar cheese that's melting on the bottom of her plate. It's very messy, of course, so utensils must be manipulated to get it all in Edgar's mouth. Edgar would then work Edgar's way up to her delicate pork belly - which is soft and liquefies easily in Edgar's mouth, flavor exploding like fireworks. The sandwich of flesh is so decadent that Edgar almost feels guilty enjoying it, but Edgar forges on. Conscience be damned. This is a meal to be relished, not to be regretted. But Edgar wouldn't rush it. She isn't some cheap slider at an airport terminal sports bar. Take a nibble. Make sure every bud is stimulated. Finally Edgar would move on to the entrée. There are many layers to her loco moco. Edgar would pierce the transparent layer of tissue covering the dainty quail egg on top - letting the bright yellow viscous yolk drip slowly down the mound of meat. Then Edgar would cut into the layers of meat  making short work of her foie gras and her spam and her hamburger and her rice and without stopping Edgar would chew and chew and chew and chew and chew with vigor and gusto and aplomb and energy... and soon Edgar and her loco moco are one...   And just when Edgar thinks it's over Edgar arrives at her chocolate crunch bar. It's a complete mystery to Edgar - the chocolate is some of the best Edgar's ever tasted - bitter yet sweet. But then there are bits of salty bacon that disrupts the experience. Baffling. But then most enjoyable relationships are, are they not? After all is said and done, Edgar would drain the rest of the Edgar's zinfandel. Then Edgar would sit back. Satiated. Spent. A little sad that the experience was over. But very grateful that it ever happened at all. And excited with the prospect of coming back. Wondering... hoping that it will be as good as the first time.

Is it the crispy pig ear? The foie gras spam combo? The fact that I can indulge in both at a nondescript spot sans signage tucked neatly between Canter's and Schwartz's on one of LA's busiest kosher districts just up the way from the Farmers Market? You'll find no glatt here, but you will find Animal's simple and creative take on eating hoof to tail is enough to make the even a kosher butcher want to grow a little foreskin and get in on the action! Aside from the total lack of signage, décor is minimal and the stark dining room boasts not much more than warm white walls, exposed lightbulb fixtures, simple wooden four tops lining both sides of the room and a little bar area at the back. Despite that, it doesn't feel cold or austere at all, but sets the tone for an experience that's all about the food. Oh, the food... The seasonal driven menu changes on a daily basis but some of their standards find their way onto the list more often than not. Rarely do I hear myself raving, 'you have to try the pig's ear', but man, you really have to try the pig's ear. It's thinly sliced and lightly fried to a crisp and served tossed with some chilis and topped with a runny, fried egg making for the perfect balance of texture and flavor, savory and sweet. Have you ever seen a lobe of goose liver so big it looked like a burger bun? How about using one of those babies as a burger bun enveloping a rare Niman Ranch patty and slice of Spam topped with a little quail egg. Spam and foie gras? Yes, spam and foie gras. It's their version of Hawaii's Loco Moco and it's over the top good. You really have to taste this one to believe it. The gravy is so rich and the dish so decadent it may just be my favorite foie gras preparation to date. Everything else, from the squid with chorizo to the massive alien-like char-grilled king crab's legs served split, and the simple salads and gnocchi were beautifully plated and delicious. (Yes, you can actually bring a vegetarian here without a total meltdown ensuing. Not sure why you would, but you can.) I noticed they also do poutine, but alas, I always blow my 5000 calorie wad much too soon. The only thing that didn't knock my socks off was the bacon chocolate bar dessert. That one sounds like it would be a no-brainer for anyone with bacon tastebuds like mine, but the execution was lacking a certain...  something. They seemed to save a layer of lard to use almost like icing but it didn't have enough of a smokey heady bacon flavor to carry it through leaving it a bit waxy and the bacon bits in the chocolate itself seemed lost. No mind though, the buttery berry tart made up for it. I could write another review on the wine list alone, but, I won't. Suffice to say it doesn't disappoint. Haven't decided yet if it's a good or bad thing I can practically walk here, but this one's definitely working its way into my regular rotation. And having run into my restaurateur neighbors here, it seems I'm not the only one.

When the Nine Inch Nails wrote, "I want to fuck you like an Animal", they must have been thinking of this place. Notice they didn't say "make love to", "go to bed with", or even "have sex with". No. They were specific. Because Animal delivers the kind of visceral experience you can otherwise only get with a dirty, sweaty, no holds barred fuck. That feeling of being deeply satiated, exhausted and with meaty juices still coating your fingers and face. Foreplay consisted of the house smoked pork belly with lentil and butterbean salad. A thick cut of fatty pork belly, marinated in a sweet barbecue sauce, perfectly grilled and caramelized. Deliciously sweet and sitting on top of a "salad" of lentils and butterbeans in a tart vinaigrette. The single slice of pork belly was at least 10" long. Apparently a very satisfying size. The main course for me was quail fry, grits, maple jus, long cooked chard, and more slab bacon. Imagine if the Colonel of KFC fame had an idiot savant younger brother who displayed sparks of culinary genius and enjoyed deep frying small birds coated in a crispy batter until golden brown, then serving them with momma's family recipe of grits and greens and four generous slices of fatty slab bacon. This was seriously finger lickin' good. And as a bonus, those small quail bones make great toothpicks. Main course for her was the flat iron steak, PBR fondue, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, and crispy leek. Befitting the theme, this dish was meaty and raw. It was sauced with a gamey, earthy sauce and topped with a PBR "fondue". After I had desecrated the bones of four small birds, I finished off the remainder of her steak. Dessert was left for home. I believe it involved a creampie of some description. As for decor, the interior was all sturdy wooden tables, benches and chairs, concrete floors and exposed bulbs. No soft furnishings to pick up any telltale stains. And just like a good brothel, there is no sign on the outside of the restaurant. Just a discrete 435 to entice you in. Animal may just be the best rebuttal for vegetarianism I've encountered. After all, the Nine Inch Nails didn't write, "I want to fuck you like a vegetable." Although that could be fun. So I've been told.

Best place to talk loud and eat  yummy food with your friends! http://www.yelp.com/user… Animal was one of the recommended restaurants from a book called "eat shop los angeles", so I gave it a try! This restaurant is very popular, so it was hard to make a reservation. I made the reservation a week in advance but only available time was 9:30pm!! I don't like eat after 9:00pm but I had no choice... I had their loco moco fois gras, http://www.yelp.com/user… fori gras biscuit, http://www.yelp.com/user… and chicken liver putty toast. http://www.yelp.com/user… It was amazing taste! but little bit salty for me. The place was bustling with energy, so you need to speak pretty loud! No wonder this place is very popular! because they know restaurant business a lot! When you put your energy to talk, you become thirsty. When you become thirsty you order more wine, and get drunk and talk more.  and get hungry, so you order more food. The food is little salty, so they get thirsty again because of salty food..... One things that I didn't like about this place was people smoke right next to the entrance area, so if you are very close to the window seats, you can smell of cigarettes. Our waiter was very nice gentleman he noticed me that I hate cigarettes, so he closed the door for me. Very nice service and food!  I wish I can drink red wine, so that i enjoy their food more..I am typical Asian who can't  brake down the alcohol easily. I became like a red monkey.... I can't drink...

Things to do before I die. * Climb Mount Everest. * Jump in the freezing waters of Antarctica through a crack in the ice. * Have a near death experience in the desert. * Fall deeply and endlessly in love. * Run a full marathon. * Eat at animal "CHECK" ! With the kind of hype animal has going for it it's easy to leave at least a little disappointed.   But dear god almighty, mother theresa, yogananda, and buddha!!! Their foie gras lying on a soft bed of buttermilk biscuit and rich maple sausage gravy was orgasmic!   Some animals are trained to react to certain words like come, or sit,..... lie, or roll over.  All you need to say to me from this day forward is (foie gras and biscuits,) and you'll have me by your side panting heavily! Maybe, just maybe your not a fan of foie gras (I wasn't until tonight,) but you like a nice cut of steak...., Animal has you covered with a truffle oil laced ribeye, over a bed of Parmesan and artichoke crusted~mashed potatoes.  The truffle oil and the potatoes went perfectly with the flat iron steak, but I felt the thick slice of cheese melted on top was a bit too overpowering for the rest of the dish. Why didn't I give them a glowing 5 stars.......? I was slightly disappointed over all, and I've decided to round down rather then up. Their squid was just so so; overly citrusy and it lacked balance, and the lamb chops were good but predictable.  The pig ear was way too spicy, to the point it made me feel a bit queasy.  The Amberjack (aka Kampachi) (aka Baby Yellowtail) was fresh, well seasoned, and nicely cut, but again it just didn't wow me or make my palate sing. Fortunately for the pig ears I brought an extremely tannic bottle of Angel's Cuvee Ripasso de Tannat 2005 from Uruguay (yes they make wine in Uruguay!)  It paired amazingly with the spicy, heavy, extremely rich food of animal.  Their wine menu has improved vastly from what's listed on their web site.  Because their wine list is much more evolved now you don't really need to bring your own bottle, but if you do the cork fee is 20.00. Oh right dessert..... did you think i forgot the main course (hell no!) We were pretty stuffed by the time we got to dessert though so we opted to share the Apricot tart with Pistachio creme fraiche.  It had a wonderful home made flavor, (perhaps a little too sweet) with a decent amount of heavy cream and chopped pistachio's drizzled over it.   Animal's a solid 4.5 star restaurant I would definitely recommend checking it out.  I'm sure I'll be back again some day. Next time my meal will go like this;  foie gras with biscuits as the appetizer, then whichever foie gras entree they have that night, followed by foie gras over candied strawberries!  That'll be a party in my mouth...

LOVE this place!!! Especially if you like offal! I was in food heaven after having their bone marrow with Chimichurri sauce and caramelized onions, poutine with oxtail gravy and cheddar cheese (like an upscale version of chilli cheese fries with no beans) and foie gras with biscuit and maple sausage gravy. And for dessert, we had the to-die-for bacon chocolate crunch bar. It was decadent and sinfully delicious!

Foie gras = my new hangover medicine Let me Explain. I woke up at 3pm on January 1st. I felt like a character from the move "The Hangover" because I felt sick, had a huge headache, and could not remember a thing from the night before. I had not been drunk in a while; in fact it had been years since I had drank as much as I did on News Years Eve 2009. After I woke up I realized my girlfriend and I had dinner reservations for Animal at 6pm, so I needed to get up and start getting ready for dinner. We arrived at Animal right at 6pm, in fact the restaurant was just opening as we walked up. We were seated immediately in their small, dim lit dinning room, and when I say dim lit, I mean really dark. I thought that the lighting really set the mood for a romantic dinner, not to mention the low light helped my pounding headache. Here's the part of the story that explains my opening statement. We started off by ordering three appetizers. We got their chicken liver toast, melted petit basque cheese with grilled onions and chorizo, with toasted bread to spread the cheese on, and last, but certainly not least, their famous biscuit topped with foie gras that is covered in maple sausage gravy. All three of these appetizers were amazing. The chicken liver toast had a nice salty taste, the melted petit basque cheese appetizer was delicious, but the foie gras was the star our appetizers. Right after I took the first bite of that dish my headache instantly vanished, and I fell into this euphoric food high. The saltiness of the foie gras and the sausage mixed with the sweet maple gravy gave this appetizer such a unique taste. This appetizer is defiantly one of the best tasting appetizers I have ever had in my life. I enjoyed their foie gras appetizer so much that for dinner I ordered their foie gras loco moco. That dish contained a small hamburger patty that is topped with spam, foie gras, and a quail egg. The stack of meat is placed on top of a bed of rice, which is drenched in a garlicky, balsamic tasting sauce. This entrée was small, but extremely flavorful. I really enjoyed the way all three meats tasted when they were combined with the rice and sauce. For dinner my girlfriend got their flat iron steak that was topped with a truffle parmesan fondue. The steak was placed on top of a sunchoke hash. This dish was incredible. The steak was extremely juicy and tender, and the truffle parmesan fondue that covered the steak was by far the tasting cheese fondue I have ever had. For dessert we ordered their famous bacon chocolate crunch bar, and an order of cinnamon sugar doughnuts that were topped with caramel sauce. Both of these desserts were delicious. The bacon bar had the perfect mix of saltiness and sweetness, and the doughnuts, which were served warm, were really sweet. The service at Animal was wonderful. Our waitress went over all their entrees with us, made sure our waters were always full, and checked on us every few minutes to make sure we had everything we needed. Animal defiantly has that WOW factor that most restaurants don't have. Their food is some of the most delicious I have ever had. I'm so glad that I did not let my hangover keep me from dining at Animal. If it was not for Animal I would have never known that foie gras is the best remedy to cure the effects of a night of heavy drinking. Animal has to be one of my new favorite restaurants of all time. I can't wait to visit eat at this amazing place again.

I have but 5 words for you and they are... The bone-in ribeye for two. Holy Flinstone Hell, Batman. This thing is unreal! And from a girl who knows her meat, and especially her steaks, believe me, what they are piling on the plate here is some serious business!! It takes up the entire plate and is then coupled with a fois gras sauce that is so addictingly divine that you practically wanna lick the plate dry. I would have, but I was in the company of a lady (Aunny D) and you just can't do that in public. We also tried the pork ribs (yeah, we have no carnivorous shame) and they were super tasty, but unfortunately were a bit cold. I mentioned it to our server for future orders, but honestly they are going on Day 3, so these little tweaks don't bother me, since they are still getting their groove down. The one thought I had that seemed a bit odd is how ice cold they served their reds. I mean, they are straight out of the freezer cold and that is something that seemed kinda off to me. Because you order a nice meaty red to go with your nice plate o meat and you don't want a chilled red. Takes away from the earthiness of the whole experience. But maybe that's just me. We also tried the much rumored and talked about Chocolate Bacon Crisp and I have to say, it didn't really do much for me. This was honestly the selling point when we read the early reviews of this place, but as for execution, we just didn't really feel like it hit the spot. There are three layers to this desert and while the creamier top layer of the bar pairs really well with the bacon, the richer darker chocolate just seemed to compete with the bacon and well, as a bacon fan over a chocolate fan any day, I felt bad for the bacon. As for the decor, this place reminds me a lot of New York. Having just eaten my way through that city for 10 days, it definitely had that streamlined, simple, modern design that while a little cold compared to what I usually prefer, it definitely sets the stage for the food to shine. I could see them changing out art here though since the walls are blank, beautiful opportunities for art to dazzle the diners. I definitely Yabba Dabba Doooooo recommend coming in to check this place out if you can.

I have been hankering to try Animal since reading about it, and hearing about if from friends who have dined there. So, finally, last night the BF and I were able to try it out. It was a last minute decision, so we didn't have any reservations. Just popped in at 6:15 pm and were told they were completely booked up, but we could sit at the bar and eat. That was cool with us. We went over to the bar, and ordered up a glass of Riesling each. As my faithful readers can probably tell by now, I'm a sucker for sweet white wine. No reds, thank you. Our first dish was the BBQ pork belly sliders. I've heard so many rave reviews about this dish that I just HAD to try it. Verdict? It was good, but way too saucy. I liked the texture of the pork belly, with a meaty and fatty side, but the sauce was dripping all the over the place! I didn't much care for that messiness. Next up was my favorite dish. Pig ears with chile, lime, and a fried egg on top. It was magnificent and original. A complete delight in my mouth. The spiciness of the chili along with the sourness of the lime really woke up my taste buds. Highly recommended. BF ordered the sweetbreads, creamed spinach, capers and hedgehog dish and we both had no idea what it REALLY was. When it arrived, I looked at it with a lack of interest. He dug in right away, told me it was good and offered me a piece. I had a taste and made a WTF face. I didn't even finish the bite. It tasted funky, and the texture was chewy, yet weird. I asked him what sweetbreads was, since it didn't taste like bread. He decided to look it up and it was so gross, I almost barfed. http://en.wikipedia.org/… = Throat of pancreas of the calf or lamb. OMFG. BARF. And this was before I knew what it was. Why the hell would they call that piece of animal sweetBREAD?!! *note to self - NEVER order stuff before consulting the Wiki first. Anyhoo. We guzzled down water and wine and waited for the next course. And waited. 20 minutes later, the black cod entree arrived. It had chorizo, garbanzo, and pickled cauliflower vinaigrette. I liked it, but was so stuffed from the previous dishes, I asked the waitress to pack it up to go. It wasn't the best cod I've ever had, since there was way too much going on. Usually, I'll still eat even if I'm full, IF the food is really good. I just didn't feel like it at this point. Don't get me wrong. Animal is a good restaurant, serving original and creative foods. But, I don't think it's the best restaurant ever like so many people have told me. The service was great, and everyone was pretty friendly. I'd probably come back, but not for a few months. The food is very heavy and definitely not for anyone on a diet. But, if you do go, just remember to get the pig ears! Dinner for two-= $116. Dayam. PIX- http://pandaliciousforme…

This fuc*ing muppet used to scare the ever loving sh!t out of me when I was a little kid I swear to Christ. http://static.px.yelp.co…  Luckily I overcame my fears, stopped wetting my bed and eventually decided to dine at Animal. So the wife totally spoils me and I get ANOTHER meal as a late bday present!  Lucky me, so I pick a spot perfect for carnivores such as myself.... Park at the Canter's lot (just tell them you're buying something at the deli after dinner) We're just a tad bit late for our reservation but we are seated immediately by a cheery hostess. I pretend for a split second to be refined and get a glass of the house red vino ($7) to sip while we wait....then I realize...who am I kidding!? and I order a http://static.px.yelp.co… Snake Dog IPA ($7) to chase it with....deelish...deep amber brew that packs a punch! Even before we walked in I realized this place was WAY too cool for me...there's no sign outside telling you where you are...and I'm not nearly douschebaggy or hipster enough to blend in....maybe that's a good thing.... So we start with the melted petit basque and chorizo with grilled bread ($11).  It comes out piping hot with the melted, baked gruyere cheese over caramelized onions and leeks with exquisite thin delicious slices of chorizo throughout...spread this awesomeness on the bread and it was gone in the blink of an eye...even the wife gobbled it up! I had been fantasizing about the foie gras, biscuit and maple sausage gravy ($22) since I had read about it....and the wife opts for flat iron steak, artichoke hash and truffle parmesan fondue ($25)  The foie gras was insanity on a plate...a mini temple to all things fatty and delicious....thank gawd the wife has a conscience and dislikes duck torture otherwise I would have had to share... I practically licked my plate clean. The wife's dinner was surprisingly unique and also very damn tasty! I was satisfied but the http://static.px.yelp.co… bacon chocolate crunch bar with s&p anglaise ($7) was screaming my name.  It arrives in all its bacony chocolatey gloriousness...I hear  celestial trumpets and angelic trombones....and then the wife dry heaving...she's not impressed obviously.  It was a perfect end to a delectable meal where I MUST return for some pork belly ,pig ears and maybe some oxtail gravy.... So get over those irrational fears...be they muppet related or otherwise...and dig into some tasty ass animals. ps. Unfortunately I couldn't stop thinking about the title of the cookbook written by the owners of the restaurant...."Two Dudes, One Pan" ...c'mon....that's gross. =)

It makes sense that I would like Animal. Not only do I like eating animals and their delicious parts (mmm... duck liver), but in high school my friends gave me several animal nicknames (which I will not disclose for obvious reasons). That said, please be advised that my appreciation for the Fairfax District eatery's compelling name does not in any way mean that my affection and subsequent four star review are based on superfluous details. I may hail from "the OC," but I'm not (completely) superficial! My predisposition to love Animal created an opportunity for my stomach to be wooed. And wooed it was... While the crispy hominy with lime was a little over-fried for my tastes (yes, that is possible), and the desserts we ordered -- a blueberry rhubarb crisp and pound cake with strawberries and cream -- were not particularly memorable, the rest of the meal I had last May was nearly flawless in execution. The petit basque -- a hot mess of luscious basque cheese, chorizo sausage and greasy onions served with buttery garlic bread -- was over-the-top, gratuitously caloric and positively glorious.  The pork belly with kimchi, scallions, chili oil and peanuts was even more compelling.  The meaty, shreddable hunks of pork were enlivened by the contrast of the sweet accompaniments.  This was my favorite dish of the night. My entree, the ling cod with king crab, gold rice succotash, and cipollini onions, was surprisingly light for a restaurant notorious for its foie gras topped burgers and oxtail-drenched poutine.  The portion was generous, yet not offensively so, and I was happy to see some veggies mixed in with all the butter.  My dining companions seemed to enjoy their order of the branzino with artichokes, leeks, ramps, and green garlic, as well, but I was far too enamored with my own selection to let my fork do any plate wandering.  (Animals like me have trouble focusing on outside stimuli during feeding time.) With regards to the charge that the restaurant isn't doin' anyone's heart any favors, I can't much disagree.  I followed up my dinner there with an 8-mile run the next morning and ate a salad for lunch that day.  But in my mind's eye, the calories and fat grams at Animal are worth it.  Not because I like the name.  Not because I like the casual yet formal minimalist setting.  And not because my friends called me Giraffe and Ostrich when I was growing up (whoops - wasn't supposed to mention that!).  It's worth it because Animal offers something most LA resto's don't -- an opportunity for extreme eating.  Fortunately for us eaters, it's also extremely delicious.

I really wanted to love this place (I'm a huge fan if all things meat), but I was a little let down.  Don't get me wrong, the dishes are definitely unique, service is excellent, and the venue is very cool.  But for the price you pay, the difficulty getting reservations, and all the hype surrounding this place, I guess I was expecting near perfection (probably partly my own fault for letting the rock star yelp rating boost my expectations). For instance, the bone marrow dish did not deliver for me.  Bone marrow is absolutely one of my favorite things to eat on this planet.  But they drenched the marrow in a very strong sauce that completely masked the natural bone marrow flavor.  I think that is a real shame.  The act of hiding the meaty goodness of the bone marrow alone tempted me to give this place 2 stars. The foie gras, like the bone marrow dish, was completely overpowered by the gravy as well (a very sweet maple sauce).  When you have a dish with foie gras, please let the foie gras be the star; not the sauce. But to the Animal's credit, the flat iron steak in truffle parmesan fondue was very good.  I'm a sucker for truffle anything.  And the bacon chocolate crunch bar lived up to the hype.  The bacon flavor complimented the chocolate perfectly. So overall it was a mixed bag for me...thus the 3 stars. If you want to try something really creative and unique, I think you may like this place.  But if you believe, like I do, that the natural glory of meat should not be hidden by excessive sauces and flavors, you may not enjoy the meal as much.

Reasons why I can't date a vegetarian: 1. I can't take him to Animal. 2. Wait, I need another reason? I mean, did you read that statement above? I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TAKE HIM TO ANIMAL. Animal reminds me why I eat meat - because it's mind-blowingly delicious. We started with the poutine with oxtail gravy. The fries were crispy, the oxtail was tender...not a bad start to a meal revolving around meat. Our second plate was the pork belly sandwiches with slaw and...I'm speechless. I honestly don't know what to say about that dish. I think about it and my mind goes to this happy place where pork melts in your mouth upon first bite.  It's essentially instantaneous euphoria - *shivers* - god, so good. Next, as an entree? Foie gras loco moco. A huge lobe of foie gras, sitting atop a slice of spam and some hamburger, on golden rice surrounded by a sauce with a hint of sriracha. Someone introduce me to the man who came up with this dish - I think I've fallen in love. Seriously, who would of thought that foie gras and spam could go so well together? We finished off the meal with a bacon chocolate crunch bar. One bite bacon, the next bite chocolate. Bacon? Chocolate? Bacon? Chocolate? A completely weird combination and the one thing I wasn't quite sure I liked (but still glad I tried). Eating at Animal was like a sign from God himself: Eat meat and you will be happy. And I was happy.

Besides being delicious (pig ear was *amazing*--thanks for the rec Yelpers!, as were the grits and bacon with the quail fry, and of course the pork sliders), ANIMAL fascinates in the way it draws back the curtain we Americans have hung in front of our animal consumption. This isn't about "pork" chops or "steak" this is about pieces of pig and cow, and chicken hearts. We are eating animals, not some pinkish protein bound in saran wrap at Ralphs. Not that you need to go here for a lesson in transparency--the food is awesome! So it's a pleasurable revelation. If you eat meat, you are eating pieces of animals cut off with a knife. Face it. And enjoy! The dessert-- panna cotta, was sort of a B--too custardy instead of tart, and the place is LOUD. But I'll certainly be returning.

I have to say that I am surprised to be giving a meat-based, meat-focused, meat-titled restaurant anything less than five stars. It's kind of sad, but then also kind of nice, you know? I can still surprise myself! After all these years, I've still got that old magic! Hey, what's up, Me?  Lookin' good, Me.  Lookin' good....awww yeaaahhhh....how YOU doin'? Ok, I am weirding myself out.  Moving on. The problem may well have been in my ordering prowess, or lack thereof. The starter was the petite Basque cheese melted over Fra' Mani something. Chorizio? Salami? I'm not sure, but as "mini saucepans of melted cheese" go, this placed a distant second to its provolone-based cousin at Lala's. I almost want to say the meat made it too...SALTY? Is such a thing possible? The words don't even sound right together...TOO. SALTY....? Weird. As an entree I got the flat-iron steak with Bordelaise sauce. I'm admittedly not a huge fan of sauces on my steaks, but it makes a lot of sense when you have either a cut of meat that isn't the greatest, or it's not cooked well. This was a lovely cut, lean without being unflavorful. And it was wonderfully, I'd say PERFECTLY, cooked. Which is why it made me sad that it was drowning in the Bordelaise. I mean, I ate it, it was very good, but I would have loved to see it stand on its own. The much discussed bacon chocolate crunch bar was very tasty, as expected. Overall it was a nice meal, but nothing spectacular. I did like the space; the rustic tables paired with the stark walls is a cool mix of homey and modern. And my dinner companions all seemed to enjoy their food, so like I said, I may have gone astray in my ordering. I'll definitely be back to try some other things off the menu.

I came here on a night filled with protestors, which I found absolutely amusing. Not that I'm against animal rights or anything like that, but mainly because they certainly weren't deterring anyone from eating at Animal. Also, they went wild for the camera when I got up to take a picture of them. We had reservations and were seated right away. Unfortunately, we didn't have too many experimental eaters in our group of four, so I'll have to come back to try the sweetbreads and such. We ordered the Foie Gras Loco Moco, Balsamic Pork Ribs, Pig Ear w/ lime & chili, the Pork Belly Sliders, and the Foie Gras w/ a biscuit. For dessert, we got the panna cotta and the tres leches. The foie gras was sooo buttery and melt-in-your-mouth delicious, but we probably overdid it with 2 different dishes. (I should also mention it was pretty educational because as I was eating it, I could see signs outside that showed how force feeding worked) The pork belly sliders were probably my favorite, but some of my companions thought they were too fatty. I didn't really like the pig ear though - I thought it was a little TOO tangy, but I 'spose that's just personal preference since it seems like other reviewers really liked it. Both the desserts were also delicious, but I thought the panna cotta was a perfect light ending to such a heavy meal. I'll have to be back to try more from their menu!

Cliff Notes: EXCELLENT LOVED IT CAN'T"T WAIT TO GO BACK What we Had: FRIED CHICKEN LIVERS, JALAPENO SLAW $6 the perfect way to start the meal! The crispy crust was THE BEST and the slaw was so refreshing! (along with an amazingly refreshing bottle of Prosecco that we brought from Silverlake Wine, this could be my dream snack!). BURRATA, ENGLISH PEAS, RADISH, OLIVE OIL $11 I am so thrilled that we took the waiter's rec and got this! I never would have ordered it but it was THE PERFECT plate to have follow the amazing chicken livers. The cheese was beautiful, almost thirst quenching, the peas were fresh and flavorful, the olive oil was great, and there were the most amazing almonds on it that just brought everything together. SLICED FLUKE, CITRUS, MINT, SEA SALT $11 Oh, this was such a pretty and delicate little dish. The fish slices were so thin and dainty with a perfect texture that was decorated with little tid-bits of citrus and jalapenos. LOVED IT! PORK BELLY, KIMCHI, PEANUTS, CHILI SOY, SCALLION $12 This was MY FAVORITE of the evening!!! HOLY HELL!!! These amazing chunky nuggets of porky goodness were so good that I actually just picked up one of the sexy little squares and ate it as if it was a delicate porky-petite-four! F**K!!! MMMM, gimme some!!! SOooooooo good! (The first 4 dishes went perfectly with the bottle of Prosecco that we brought from Silverlake Wine) BALSAMIC PORK RIBS, ROASTED PARSNIPS & CARROTS, PINE NUTS, RAISINS $37 Wow, now this was a RACK o' RIBS!!! I have to say that these ARE the best (non-Korean) ribs I have had in LA!!! The sauce, the way the bones were practically jumping outta the meat on their own! I can't believe we almost ate the whole rack after devouring all the dishes that came before this beautiful display of meaty-goodness! (The ribs were paired with a bottle of Cuvee di Gabry Sparkling Rose $36 which was an EXCELLENT suggestion by one of our servers) SERVICE: I cannot say enough good things about it! Wow! Friendly gents who really know the food and appear to be happy to be there! The bussers were super-friendly! The hostess was very pleasant. Top drawer! Not fussy. : ) CLIENTELE: a mixed bag of pleasant people who looked as if they were enjoying themselves while enjoying a no-fuss, casual meal of good food, good wine, and good company. Thank you Mister W for a wonderful meal. Enjoy.

This was the local for my latest birthday dinner with my best friend. To say that I enjoyed eating the wonderful display of meatiness I was served is an understatement. I started with the Foie Gras. It was as big as my hand, served on a biscuit, drenched in Sausage Gravy. I had to hold back the urge to make sweet sweet love to it after the first bite. Everything tasted like a little piece of carnivorous heaven. Also, the staff was great and the ambiance was awesome. This place as the vibe of a NYC eatery with it's decor and cool vibe. Definitely a place to take a date to show you know your stuff.

Sunrise came and I couldn't escape my body..   I slowly opened my eyes, and a desire awoke within me... The scent and taste of ANIMAL enveloped my senses once again..   I stayed in lust underneath the sheets, remembering the explosion of bliss inside my mouth...   I smiled, eyes and lips tenderly closed...provoked my senses and teased my morning hunger with flashbacks of last nights indulgence. This night, I was a savage...   an animal, senses heightened with a passionate appetite... Foreplay:   I took the roughly textured garlic bread and paired it with the soft, glistening, moist...smooth in the eyes MELTED PETIT BASQUE slowly slid it through my lips and bit gently...~ Astonished, I knew this was only but a tease...I need to have more.. I moved over to the GRILLED SQUID with CHIMICHURRI..not overly chewy...it required less jaw movement than others I've had before...I slowly but steady relished it in my mouth... Next, was the decadent sweet juicy taste of the PORK BELLY...this required three of my fingers to reach my mouth...crispy in all the right places...sauce dripping down my fingers...I controlled my moan and carefully licked the sauce off my fingers one by one... CLIMAX: FOIE GRASS, MAPLE SAUSAGE GRAVY & BISCUIT  ~ without hesitation it claimed my mouth...for a moment I know not what happened...the room went blurry and satisfaction was reached...Holy Mother of G*d! I could no longer contain myself...Breathing stopped for a moment...and I was obssesed... because I want more... Once is sometimes not enough...I need a little bit more...a little bit of LOCO MOCO and I knew after this I would be spent...completely satisfied and in tears...being a spam and quail lover..this was perfect..I let it linger in me a little longer...enjoyed every single taste it offered ...it was bliss...it was heaven...it was perfection.. POST: Tres Leches: Moist, sweet..and decadent...I am completely out of words... I'm in love...

I've been wanting to try Animal for a while, and finally got the chance. Obviously, this place is not for vegetarians, as the menu is meat-centric, offering various meats and cuts that are rarely found all in one place, including oxtail, rabbit, sweetbreads and octopus. boudin, rooster aioli, gherkin - This boudin was made of chicken liver and rice, then fried in bite-sized balls. It was actually pretty light, and nicely crispy - a good way to start the meal. pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg - Here, pig ears are sliced thin and fried. Combined with lime and chili peppers, it's topped with a fried egg. Honestly, the fried egg really makes this dish for me. The spiciness of the peppers was slightly mellowed out by the runny egg yolk, which really brought everything together. However, I could've used two egg yolks here. barbecue pork belly sandwiches, slaw - First off, the pork belly was melt-in-mouth tender. It probably helped that it was a rather fatty piece of pork. The meat was succulent, with the barbecue sauce adding a slight sweetness and smokiness that was not overpowering. Too often I see BBQ pork sandwiches that are dredged in a thick BBQ sauce, and this was not the case. The coleslaw added just the right amount of acidity and lightness to this dish. Bravo! poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - I remembered seeing a picture and description of this dish when I first heard about Animal and was like...this is a total must-order. I love oxtail. Here we have braised oxtail and its gravy (presumably the braising liquid), on top of french fires and a mild cheddar cheese.  I think the fries were fried extra crispy, in order to add more texture, and combat sogginess from the gravy. Really delicious - definitely a fan. foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger - Here's a play on the Hawaiian staple dish of loco moco which, at its base, usually has rice topped with a burger patty, spam, fried egg, and gravy. Animal steps it up a notch with a lobe of foie gras. Completely decadent and rich! I first tried pieces of each of the components separately and found them good on their own. Combined, it made for something quite tasty (though, it can be hard to taste the foie gras with all those components, since it's a pretty thin slice). This was probably my favorite dish of the night. bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise - Of course, a restaurant named 'Animal' would have a dessert with bacon in it. I've heard a lot about this dish, and it's the must-try dessert on the menu. Layers of rich chocolate and hazelnuts is topped with bacon bits. I like salty things with chocolate, and the bacon lended this saltiness and the "crunch" in this bar. While good, I wouldn't particularly say it was 'great,' however I was pretty full by this point. peach and raspberry pie, whipped cream - Animal serves a daily pie topped with freshly whipped cream. Today's pie was peach and raspberry. The peaches were nice and sweet, and the raspberries were tart (a little too tart for me). The pie crust was quite nice though, and the whipped cream was a nice accompaniment. I began to actually eat the cream with the bacon chocolate crunch bar, which made for a pretty good combination. In all, Animal met my (high) expectations. The food is a little different, with innovative takes on comfort food and some new dishes altogether.  The food is very rich, and you're likely to leave full and sleepy. At least, I did. I would come back, especially for the pork belly sandwiches and loco moco, as well as to try some of the rest of the dishes on the menu.

Review #750... 3/4 of the way to 1000! I came here with Angela C. and friends. I'm not into exotic ingredients and offals, but this place proved me wrong. I've heard so many good things about this place that I had to try it out. Let's get the unimportant things over with, the ambiance is nice and hip (music, but not loud enough so you can still have a conversation), it's a small 45-capacity restaurant, so it's quite intimate. The service is excellent! Waiter was one of the best I've had. He's knowledgeable and also keeps it real. He didn't force us to get the $35 foie gras or $28 beer. Now with the important stuff...the food: I'd have to agree with Angela C. with the most part. We came here with 6 of us, and split 9 different dishes "tapas/family" style. If you're not going to share, you'll probably need 2 dishes, which will set you about $30 (since a dish is about $10-16). Had we'd not shared, I'd would've went with the bbq pork belly sliders and hamachi tostada. Nothing too "crazy exotic" for me. Those were probably my favorites of the night. hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut The hamachi tostada...you can just taste the balance of the taste (the spice, acidity, and flavorful balance) and texture (crunchiness of the tostada shell, softness of the hamachi, topped with the refreshing crispness of the cabbage). It has the right amount of acidity. It's a zen thing! 5 stars barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw The bbq pork belly was cooked to a nice crisp which adds texture and taste. The right amount of fattiness of pork belly is great choice of protein, it doesn't fall apart like pulled pork. The slaw, I'm still trying to figure out how it was made, it's adds a like tanginess that complements the fattiness oh so well. Topped with sweet bread, it's once again has great balance in the dishes. 4.5 stars rabbit loin, country ham, succotash I'm not a fan of rabbit, so I may not have enjoyed this dish as much as the others. The presentation is so appetizing to the eye. The rabbit is cooked well, but its smokiness taste kind of like smoked pork, or maybe it's the ham. The succotash/sauce is a nice subtle complement. 3.5 stars grilled octopus, chorizo, chowchow This was probably my least favorite dish. It's kind of a messy mix of chorizo and grilled octopus; you don't know what you're eating. My friend said the octopus tasted like ground meat, and he was right because he didn't even eat a piece of octopus! Poor guy! I thought the octopus was really fishy; it didn't really go well together. 2 stars chicken liver toast I grew up on canned deviled chicken, so I can eat chicken liver paste. This is a sophisticated version of it, since I grew up in the hood. Anyways, it's topped with caramelized onions that add to the sweetness. I thought it was a little too rich for my liking, but don't get me wrong, it's really good. 4 stars pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg Pig eats is one of exotic foods I do eat. It's a little different than the Chinese way of braising them. Here it's actually fried. Adds texture, it's really good. The lime made it a little overly acidic to my liking. There's a really spicy kick at the end. Nice! 4.2 stars sweetbreads, creamed spinach, capers, oyster mushroom If you know what sweetbreads is, then there's a reason I didn't really try this dish. However, I took a very tiny bite of it, and actually I really enjoyed the crispy texture. It was also quite flavorful. I really enjoyed the creamed spinach though, flavorful and so creamy soft. 4 stars balsamic pork ribs, early girl tomato & cucumber panzanella I was a little disappointed with this dish. It sounds good, and it should be good. The salad was quite fresh with heirloom tomatoes (tonight instead of the early girl tomato), it had a nice and simple vinaigrette. The ribs were a little too overly sauced. It made it a little too salty and acidic with the balsamic. Nice idea and would've been better had it had less sauce. I used some of the sauce with the marrow bone bread and that was delicious! The ribs were cooked perfectly though. 3.8 stars marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions I enjoyed the texture and presentation of this dish. It's what marrow is meant to taste like. The chimichurri sauce adds a balance of the acidity that cuts into the richness of the marrow. Once again, the dish has nice balance. The caramelized onions bring it to the next level with the sweetness. 4 stars Overall this restaurant has great BALANCE. Texture. Flavor. They are great in using acidity to cut the richness and exoticness of the dishes. I'd give this restaurant 4.4 stars, okay I admit, so my individual stars don't average out, but the good food was overshadowed with an even greater  dining experience. We were here for about a 2.5 hour dining experience that included good food, good drinks, good service, great conversations and laughs, and even greater company. Definitely try this place out!!!

I find it strange that I've spent nearly a year in Taiwan, a place where practically every part of the pig is a beloved delicacy, yet the first time I tried pig ear was on my short trip back home. Are they always this good, or is Animal on to something? My friend and I weren't particularly hungry, so we decided to just split a few appetizers and skip the main course. We ordered pig ear w/ chili and lime, barbecue pork belly sandwiches, melted petite basque w/ grilled bread, and poutine w/ oxtail gravy and cheddar. Everything was delicious, and although I feared it would be an overload of meat, each dish was so unique in both flavor and texture that you didn't feel like you were consuming an entire animal. I think my favorite was actually the pig ear - crispy, sour, and spicy - which I thought combined an interesting blend of Asian and Mexican flavors. A close second would be the pork belly sandwiches - how could you go wrong with barbecue sauce and fork-tender pork? This place is definitely not recommend for the vegetarians or the health-conscious, but for the foodies and the carnivores, it's a must-try. Not only is the food good, but the service is among the best I've ever received - happy, friendly people really do make your dining experience that much better!

Thoroughly enjoyed this hip, eclectic restaurant with its bent towards all things meat.  In typical LA fashion, apparently you just have to be in the know (and I was, having made resos weeks in advance.  yay!) because there is no sign out front, the decor is stark and minimalist to the max .. and every seat is filled with a score of folks waiting for the next open table. We tried a number of dishes: - barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw: served two per order, the pork belly was deliciously rich, fatty and juicy. - foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy: interesting presentation with the foie gras lying on top of a biscuit on a plate covered in gravy.  Reminded me of a super fancy breakfast item.  Loved it. - marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions: I've had bone marrow in the past ... but this was by far the largest serving I've seen at a restaurant.  The green, chimichurri sauce added a nice quick to the silky marrow over light toast. - pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg: actually quite good (vaguely resembling chili-lime Doritos) but personally I was a little squeamish about chomping on so much ear.  Apparently, none of my friends at dinner at that issue. - poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar: this was a delicious variation of poutine I've had in the past.  The tender meat and sauce reminded me of Korean short ribs that were served over a bed of crispy fries that soaked up the juices.  One of my favorites.  Also, compared to the other dishes, this one was more substantial in portion. - balsamic pork ribs, delicata squash, apple - another amazing dish with pork falling off the bone and served with a side salad.   If it wasn't for the fact that we were here for NYE and going out to party, there is no question we would probably have ordered about twice as much because there were so many good things to try (including the bacon chocolate crunch bar for dessert, which we passed on).   Also appreciated the eclectic beer selection, which included a crisp Mama's Little Yella Pils and a darker Bear Republic Racer 5 IPA that gave hints of chocolate.

I'd say Animal is a little lacking in ambiance, but that's probably because they've put all their creative energy into the fantastic menu. The name of the restaurant is their specialty so it's not really a place for a vegetarian date. Pescatarians would be all right though because they have a lot of great seafood options. Our dining party of 4 sampled lots and lots of food during a recent visit. The definite stand out of the evening was a shredded pig ear topped with a fried egg. I also highly enjoyed a squid and chorizo dish that Andrea ordered. Other items I tried included salads (with the most delicious Parmesan cheese), crab legs (quite tasty, too), gnocchi (kind of bland surprisingly), a berry tart (terrific way to end a meal) and bacon chocolate (probably the biggest disappointment food-wise of the evening.) I had a fairly reasonably priced glass of Prosecco (of course) and they had a decent assortment of other wines on the menu. And the lone piece of décor was an Animal lunchbox, which is totally cool. The menu changes daily so check it out online before you go to see if they'll be serving up animals that you'd enjoy eating that night.

The food is worthy of four stars, but the service was horrific! My sister, Aunt E and I went to Animal last Saturday night. We were seated at 7pm and didn't receive our appetizers until 8:15pm! Talk about dining at a glacial pace! The food was somewhat reasonably priced (dishes range from $5.00-29.00), but the wine was outrageously priced! $23.00 for a GLASS of Pinot Noir? You've got to be kidding me! I can buy TWO decent BOTTLES of wine for that price! To make matters worse, the restaurant was extremely noisy and sound was resonating throughout the restaurant. You could hear the chefs' pots and pans clamoring in the kitchen!   It's a shame that our dining experience was rotten because the food was pretty good. Animal serves basic, stripped down American food with no frills. The bouillabaisse, kelpe salad, fondue and flat iron steak were excellent. This is all I have left to say: : P

I was across the street for a signing of Matt Groening's "Simpson's Treehouse" thing. As long as I'm already on the block why don't I just slip over to Animal for a quick bite.  It was Tuesday night and although unreserved, I imagined I wouldn't have any trouble getting in. Wrong.  Even though there were plenty of empty tables I was told they would fill up with reserved customers momentarily. With taste buds already perked by the scent, I was not about to let anything stand in my way.  First I begged, then I bargained.  I'm not proud.  I promised I would only eat one dish, and I'd be out the door before their other guests arrived.  They seated me, and I was good to my word, even though it was difficult.  I saw several other things I would have liked to order, most of them starting with the words pork belly. I had the smoked trout with bacon, corn and avocado.  It was just perfect.  The crispy salty skin was separated from the succulent body; the softness and the crunch complementing each other,  giving a nice presentation over greens.  The avacado could've been 24 hours riper, but you can't always have everything. Oh yes you can.  I went next door to Schwartz's Bakery for some pastries.  Ahhhh.  Everything a human being needs on one block.

Animal wasn't what its cracked up to be.  We had an 8:30 reservation and because one of our guests canceled, they changed it to 9:30 (who gets priority...seriously!)  We got there early in anticipation of sitting down and eating at 9:30, BTW the place has no sign, because they are just too trendy for that, all you'll see is the address if you can read it at night.   We didn't sit down until 10:10, which is ridiculous...considering there were a number of people done with their meals and just sitting at the tables playing angry birds. The wine menu is obnoxious, there isn't a glass under 15 dollars and the one 11 dollar glass they have is a terrible wine. The food was all way too heavy, sauced and fried!  If I am going to go to a restaurant to have veal sweet breads or pig ears, I want it to taste that way not be covered up by sauces and oil.  The place were unbelievably small, they said they were medium sized, but they weren't.  our friend ordered one meal that was a hamburger, foie grois, quail egg and span on rice that was $35.  My fiance got the ribs which were poor quality and you only got 4 of them for $19. Overall, I was completely upset that we spent that much money on food that wasn't even mediocre. If you want to spend over $125 for two people, enjoy.

Had my first experience at Animal last night and it fabulous.  The worst thing we had was the mint tea and seriously if that's all i can find to complain about then you need more than 5 stars. the exterior is very non-descript with absolutely no signage at all to identify itself by... and other than the valet on the street, you wouldn't even know its a restaurant.  inside it's sparingly decorated w/ old fashioned over sized light bulbs and a discreet Animal lunch pale quietly displayed on the wine bar. we tried the raw amberjack which was more like a like a chunky citrus jalapeno whitefish ceviche -- yummy yummy yummy.  we also had the pork rib "salad" which was essentially 4 pieces of ribs and a side of salad w/ toasted garlic bread and heirloom tomatoes... again yummy yummy but now my tummy is starting to fill up b/c the ribs are very rich and heavy. (good thing we split the food family style btwn 3 people).   and now the main course(s)... flat iron steak and braised pork..  the steak was laid a top a bead of corn w/ small potatoes and onions.  it was soooo good but also very rich.  now on to the braised pork.  since we were sharing, my friend put his fork into it to cut it w/ his knife but no need b/c it basically came apart like butter w/ a hot knife.  it was served over a bed of extra creamy (but not too milky) garlic mashed potatoes.  there's also a peruvian chirraco (spelling?) sauce that came w/ it which helped to cut some of the rich flavor but all very delicious. so -- for those of you who like to skip to the end.  YOU MUST TRY ANIMAL but on an empty stomach please b/c there's lots to eat, including a unique bacon covered chocolate thing.  the bacon was like salty rice crispy treats and not very baconny at all and tasted like a fudge heath bar.

Final Decision: Good unique food small portions So this place hated on me on my friend's bday when they denied his reservation to add me in.  I was mad, but at the same time I was still yearning to try their food.  My friend mentioned that his meal was okay but there were many things that didn't seem to work out.  He said the sliders and sauces were the good things here, I must try this for myself.   So went out with the GF and scouted this spot out.  Got to the door and requested for first available table, which turned out to be the bar, sat down an perused the menu, and ended up selecting the following: Heirloom Tomato salad - simple yet artistic, small wedges of red and green tomatoes sprawled across a plate with a sheep's milk cheese vinegrette and arugula.  The light pepperiness of the arugula intertwined with the juiciness of the tomatoes by the rich creamy dressing floundering underneath gives the dish a delicious and flavorful taste behind the beautiful plating. Rabbit Loin - I previously had rabbit at a Brazilian BBQ place and it had ruined my desire and taste buds for the product, however, Animal has altered my opinion.  Sitting around a bed of sweet and savory succotash, is nice round juicy rabbit loins wrapped in crispy country ham.  That loin was lightly seasoned and combined with the saltiness and fattiness of the ham, which was cooked to resemble bacon, truly enhanced and elevates that product.  I would order this 3 times over. Flat Iron Steak - sitting over a bed with grilled artichokes, and nice tender piece of steak was seasoned and grilled nicely, and covered by melty parmesan and truffle oil fondue and decorated with some mouth watering au jus sauce.  This was probably the best dish of the night, and I would have to say a strong staple dish to be ordered on any visit to this restaurant. Pie of the Day -  home made apple pie with light and fluffy creme fraiche.  Flaky crust, smooth tarty granny smith apple slices, and a well set sauce, this slice of pastry was done very well.  I can't say this was the best slice of pie I've ever had but it is good. Apparently there was a pork belly slider that was super awesome that I must now return and try.  To be continued, but for now a must frequent spot in LA.

I hate to do this after our waiter showed a personal interest in our party, but three stars it is for me. He informed of us of entrees he thought were strong and instructed us to order family style and share as dishes would come out at different times. The restaurant itself is minimalist in decor and looks great; watch for the address number of the restaurant at night rather than the name on the front. It's hard to see. You'll see the valet parking in front. The pork belly sandwich (two sliders) with glazed buns and cole slaw inside the sandwich was the best entree for me. This was one of the entrees I ordered. The pork belly and sauce is quite good and the glazed buns are a nice, sweet touch. The flat iron steak with parmesan was ordered medium rare but was served as more of a medium. The potatoes that went with the steak were good. I would not recommend this entree nor the pork belly with kimchi, they were both not my taste. I did notice the latter entree was the slowest to be finished by our party. There was also a foie gras with buttermilk biscuit and maple sausage gravy. I think a lot of people at our table enjoyed this. I liked it but I would not order it again. Our waiter refilled our waters constantly and seemed interested in the rest of the party's photographing of the dishes. I must have found the food very rich, I found I had a stomach ache and could not bring myself to try dessert. All in all, good company, intriguing entrees. Thanks Holly for organizing the dinner, we had a great time.

Not sure what I think about this place???? Read so many raving reviews and had a special day around the corner so we decided to go. Made reservations and we were on are way. When we got there it was nice and trendy. They had hip hop music playing pretty loud in the background which was cool. We ran a little late due to the stupid LA traffic but got there around 6:15 when our reservations were for 6:00. Called in to give them the heads up and a nice girl said please hurry I'l try to hold you table for a few more minutes but when we got there the place was empty. Not completely empty but nothing to tell me to hurry in LA traffic. Okay enough of that. Let's get to the food because that's what we came for! Chicken Liver Toast = Very good if you like pate. For $3.00 you can't go wrong. Kale salad = Get two plates of this and you won't be disappointed Grilled Octopus = Pass Pass Pass. Nothing to brag about. Bone Marrow = Okay but don't eat to much. I think the chimichurri overpowered the marrow but still a tasty dish. Fried Sweetbreads = The menu changes every once in awhile so the sweetbread dish we got was different then others mentions. Our came with some sauteed onions and ground beef. The sweetbreads were battered and fried which made the the sweetbreads lost in all that. Veal Brains = Get this just cause. Texture was different but at least you can say you had it. This got my thumbs up and I tricked the table into trying it :) BBQ Pork Belly Sliders = This was off the HOOK! Poutine with Oxtail Gravy and Cheddar = Very Very good but heavy! Foie Gras Biscuit = I love foie gras so get this but eat it alone and try the biscuit after so you can taste the foie gras, Bacon dessert bar = Pass on it and go to Luxe Grand Cafe and get the beignets with the trio sauce.

Unique dining experience, creative presentations, and the richest dishes you can imagine.  If you like flavorful and fatty dishes, check out Animal. I heard about Animal after telling a friend how much I enjoyed dining at A Pied Du Cuchon (sp?) in Montreal, where you can order foie gras on top of poutin (french fries smothered with gravy and cheese curds). Naturally, we had to try the oxtail poutin at Animal.  It was delicious; rich, hearty, and the meat perfectly cooked. Our second entree was the loco moco, pairing a medium rare hamburger patty with foie gras, spam, a fried quail egg and maple syrup.  If this dish sounds like a bad dream, this is not the restaurant for you.  I enjoyed the dish, but the individual flavors were drowned out by the sauce.  Still very enjoyable. Wine selection was decent and reasonably priced. I will return again to try more artery clogging fare from the menu.

Man~! I really wanted to like this place but it's not like I hated it.   A few weeks ago...two of my gal friends and I decided to check out this interestingly named restaurant. We made reservations but still had to wait about 15 minutes before we got seated. I was a bit irked but got over it. I guess it happens but waiting sucks. Anyway, our server came by for our drink order. We decided to order a bottle of  wine. He was an upselling maniac. Ugh. Only picked the most expensive wines on the menu. We told him we'd look it over and let him know. So we looked over the wine list and food menu. First of all...there is not that much to choose from...food wise. Anyway we didn't order the wines he suggested, we ordered something in the mid price range. So he goes to fetch it and comes back to tell us they're all out. Hmph. Not happy. So we decided on another which ended up being a great bottle of wine. For food, we decided to order an appetizer, a salad and the ribeye for two. The server, of course being the upselling maniac that he is, tried to make us order more, saying that's probably not gonna be enough.  Boy, are we glad we didn't listen to him because we were so full by the end of our meal. These were the items we ordered: -Petite basque and garlic bread, way too salty, -Heirloom tomato salad, terrific presentation and taste, had a great dressing, -Ribeye for two, tender but way to salty again. The ribeye for two was topped with a foie gras sauce and came with what looked like mashed potatoes which was delicious. But like I said the ribeye itself  was too salty. I think it might've been the sauce now that I think back because the steak was drenched in the foie gras sauce. Anyhow, overall it was an okay meal. They just need to tone down on the salt a bit on the food. The server was attentive but needs to tone down the upselling a bit. The ambiance...well there isn't much on the walls...nothing spectacular. Just a very simple look. I don't think I would be dying to dine here again anytime soon...but maybe one day I will go back.

STILL f*cken good~!!  Damn... I think it tasted better the 2nd time around which is SO RARE!  I usually just like to try restaurants once and seek new places but with Animal... I can come here over and over again.  My MOST favorite eatery in LA! So I basically ordered most of the same things like the BBQ Pork Belly Sandwiches which was stilll BOMB.  Just dig into it and don't be shy.  Lick up your fingers and hands.... and arm when the sauce drips.  It's so freaken good. The foie gras loco moco was better the 2nd time around!   Poutine with Oxtail Gravy and Cheddar Taking junk food to the next level!  It wasn't too rich or salty.  The oxtail gravy is just effin perfect on top of fries.  I never had the authentic Canadian style poutine before to compare but if it is just as good as this then I am a fan of this staple. The new thing I tried: Sweetbreads with Creamed Spinach, Capers and Hen of the Woods I am very picky on how sweetbreads are prepared and cooked where I was not impressed by the 3 Michelin Star Jean-Georges' version in NYC because it just tasted like chicken and there was no distinction between a piece of chicken nugget and the delicateness of sweetbread.  I thought Animal's version was excellent.  It is sauteed and had a nice creamy center and that's how I prefer it.  The sauce was lemony from the lime and capers while savory from the mushrooms and reduction. AND of course the bacon crunch chocolate bar to top off the meal.  I love you Animal!!  (And I do NOT use the word love loosely AT ALL.)

if you've got animal instincts to eat meat, then you may be tempted to try the unusual creations here.. I KNOW I WAS I was especially tempted to come to this restaurant after trying one of their pork belly dishes at Jonathan Gold's Goldstandard event two years ago, but i was a bit disappointed when I came here! we ordered -----Hamachi toastada, my favorite dish, which had a great freshness to the lettuce and jalapenos on top! kind of reminded me of the toppings to a bowl of pho -----pork belly sliders w/ slaw, comes w/ two fatty burgers! not amazing but not bad.. good carmelization -----lamb meat balls w/ rice .. kind of lacking in flavor.. -----sweet bread.. NO ITS NOT ACTUALLY BREAD. i was totally expecting some crostinis... but i think these were organs of some sort. according to wikipedia.. the thyroid and thymus?... nice breading.. but a bit salty for my taste! I really felt like i just downed lard for dinner.. everything was very heavy even though its small tapas style plates!..OH animal, i wanted to like you.. but i guess it's just not for everyone NOTE: i don't think they have a sign with their name outside.. and its in the middle of an area w/ a lot of abandoned stores! Parking:we skipped the valet and found free street parking in the neighborhood behind the restaurant!

Way too dark inside and the restaurant itself is really hard to find. I didn't want to take any big risks so I went with the rabbit loin. My rabbit must have been anorexic because the portion of meat I ate that night was rather disappointingly small. So small that after tearing off a few strands of meat, I was done with my dish even before the bf's food came out. I don't know about you, but when I go to a place called "Animal" I expect to sink my teeth into some juicy meat. ALSO, the chocolate bacon bar is misleading and doesn't have any bacon inside. boo.

BEWARE! This restaurant has NO NAME outside. I drove past it like 4 times and missed it every single time lol. Anyways, this restaurant is small. We couldnt get reservations until 9:30 PM. We called around 3 PM to get them too! Moving on. The "Animal" experience is fabulous. The place is nice, very modern look, dim lighting, loud music, everyone drinking wine, and everyone dressed very trendy. I mean, it is in West Hollywood ;). On to the food. Their menu is ridiculous! Rabbit legs, pork belly, and and some other crazy stuff. My friend and I got the Pork Belly Sliders (best stuff on earth), the poutine w ox tail (very YUMMY), and the flat iron (the parmesan fondue on top was too salty for my taste). For dessert we got the chocolate bacon bar thing. I forgot the exact title, but it was surprisingly delicious. I was on red meat overload after I left this place. All the food is tapas style and brought out one at a time. They give you a new dish and utensil every single time too. I loved that. Maybe next time Ill try the rabbit legs.... Not 5 stars because its hard to find and I didnt like the fondue.

I came here for a graduation dinner, and absolutely loved it!  But be warned, this is not a place to go in a hurry.  They have a small kitchen and may work as fast as they can, but the meal is a very slow and relaxed process.  As long as you're OK with that, you'll really enjoy it. As appetizers we got the pork belly with kimchi, poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar (oxtail fries), and I think the sliced fluke, citrus, etc...  Everything was really good.  The pork was super tender.  The kimchi wasn't boiled, like usual, but actually retained its crispness.  The fries were absolutely delicious, and I can say that I've tried (and liked) oxtail!  The citrus fluke was thinly sliced, with a very strong flavor.   As a main course I got the flat iron steak.  With was also pretty good, but I didn't find it overly impressive as steaks go.  Nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about either.  I also tried the balsamic pork ribs.  There were so many ribs, they wouldn't even fit on their biggest plate, so these are either to share of for a hungry giant.  I'm not usually a fan of ribs, mostly because they are difficult to eat, but in this case the meat fell of the bones and was as tender as the other pork dish.   For dessert we got the tres leches, dulce de leche, blueberry rhubarb crisp, and the bacon chocolate crunch bar.  I was most excited about the bacon crunch bar, but it fell short for me.  It was a good couple pieces of dark chocolate, with some crunchy stuff on it, and a hint of bacon.  I was hoping for more bacon integration though...  The blueberry rhubarb was pretty good, but I thought could have been warmer and crunchier.   By far the best was the tres leches.  It was fluffy and soft and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  Definitely get that!

I love this place: no sign on the door, stripped interior, exposed lighting. Plus the copper-topped bar is a nice touch with it's patina-potential...chemistry is sexy. And they (chefs Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo aka the food dudes)are not afraid of the other white meat...it's changing menu offers a plethora of yummy dishes...try the bacon bit covered crunch bar for dessert! cause nothing goes together then bacon and chocolate...right?

Great restaurant, with a nice atmosphere and extremely convenient hours -- I have only been there at around 1am on Saturdays. And the food there can be especially suited for these late hours! - Chicken liver toast: quite good and great value - Barbeque pork belly sandwiches: great sliders - Marrow bone: first time I ate some, quite good - Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy: great dish! - Bacon chocolate crunch bar: disappointing Overall, great experience, I would highly recommend it!

Unbelievable. I could go on and on (as many previous reviewers have) about the intricacy's of every dish and still wouldn't feel like i didn't do this place justice. From the amazing food, to the great service, the obviously well thought out progression of the dishes and the clean, sleek feel of the restaurant, this is a place i cant wait to return to and have been recommending to anyone who will listen. Musts: Pork belly sliders, oxtail poutine and Joe's doughnuts. Must Not: The foie gras with maple sausage gravy. Almost impossible NOT to order this at least once and while each component was solid (although the gravy is suuuuuper sweet) this dish did not add up as a sum of its parts. Would have been better as two separate dishes. The leisure with which i enjoyed my meal was maybe the best part, as the dishes came out at the perfect pace for both enjoying ones meal and ones company. Go experience for yourself, ya filthy animal.

Pros: bone marrow & chimichurri, bacon/chocolate dessert, Mexican cokes, genuine service, valet, chill atmosphere. Cons: fried quail, pig ears, lack of signage (this joint's easy to miss - just remember it's right before Canter's). In all, I wouldn't seek it out nor choose it if dinner plans were left to me....it's more of a 3rd or 4th choice. Still, it's pretty creative, and I'm a carnivore heavy-hitter at heart.

So i arrive at the place and yes it's a little pretentious.. no signage!!! Ok so it's crammed like sardines in this place with is sort of a good thing.. some times you don't want to have a private dinner! on to the food. Chicken Liver toast - what can i say tastes like liver.. :/ Marrow Bone- Fatty as expected but great flavor! Butternut soup? - creamy and delicious Thai BBQ Quail- WHOA! What?! It's so tender and juicy.. too bad it's a quail!! Will be going back for this again! Didn't think it was incredibly over priced because  food was definitely  worth it!

Oh boy. If you want to enjoy your meal at Animal, make sure to gird your loins in preparation for one explosively foodgasmic, meat-intense experience. Animal's namesake, the Muppet version that is, sits on a lunchbox on a shelf behind the bar. He is an apt spiritual guide for the restaurant version, in both execution and experience. The food here is intense and adventurous, evoking much of the same feelings in those who partake. I came here with my mom on Sunday night, Easter Sunday, and all I can say is "hallelujah, praise the Lord, he is risen indeed that we may chow down on meat. Amen!" As we waited to order, Vinny Dotolo poked his head out of the kitchen several times. It was nice to know that he was the one behind the food coming out, not content to rest on his laurels of "celebrity chef." His presence boded well for the evening. Once settled, we were treated to something of a round robin of servers, figured out the wine list and got down to business. We approached the menu with a game plan of six small plates: Chicken liver toast Blood orange (you know, for a palette cleanser) Quail fry BBQ pork belly sandwiches Roasted marrow bone Sweetbreads Several of these items I had never had--the marrow and the sweetbreads--but thought Animal was probably the place to experience them for the first time. I was not disappointed. The bone marrow was the "purest" meat taste I've ever had--literally the most interior part of the animal available. The marrow sat exposed and vulnerable in the bone, topped with a bright green chimmi churri sauce, a small spoon waiting at the ready. I had never tasted anything quite like it. Same for the sweetbreads, which I liked better the less I thought about what they actually were. Their texture was especially striking. Milky is the word I would use to describe their overall aura, the meat white and ... I don't know ... kind of strange (not in a bad way) and spongy when I cut into it. They were complemented nicely with the hen of the woods mushrooms (another first). The grits and maple jus were my favorite part of the quail fry. The chicken liver toast was flavorful but small, as noted here before. The blood oranges were refreshing and spicy and unique. My favorite dish though was probably the pork belly. Big shock there. It was like a slider on steroids, the soft bread and creamy slaw augmenting the smooth fattiness of that pork. Mmm-mmm-mmm ... yum! Actually, my favorite part of the meal came at the end with the chocolate bacon crunch bar. It put Vosges version to shame--shame! Imagine a Nestle Crunch bar but better. A thick layer of dark chocolate surrounded by two lighter chocolate layers. Strewn throughout are little crunchy bits. But what are they, exactly? Pork rinds? Little rice crispies? I'm not sure, but I don't care. It was so tasty. The pork flavor came as a top note, at the end of the bite, a few moments after the swallow. Oh wow, where does that come from? It's like chocolate infused with eau de bacon. So good, so unusual. Animal has provided my favorite dining experience in L.A. thus far. Unusual, adventurous, daring. These are all things a special meal should be, and Animal delivers all of these in spades. Leave your culinary inhibitions behind (and your vegan friends) and enjoy.

Minus one star because all that foie made me throw up afterwards when I got home. And I have a friend who also threw up after eating at Animal (so it's not just me). BUT despite our foie intolerance...I LOVE ANIMAL!  Here is what I would do differently next time -- only order ONE dish with foie gras, we had both the loco moco and biscuit...both delish but if you need help deciding which, I'd say loco moco if you're feeling more savory and biscuit for more sweet. BBQ pork sliders -- A+++. We wanted to order another. Tres leches -- A+ Listened to other Yelpers advice and got the tres leches instead of the bacon chocolate dessert...I saw the chocolate come out, and it doesn't look very appetizing. So tres leches trumps the bacon chocolate. The portions do not look like much, but the food is so heavy and rich that you will get full quick. So don't over-order so you can save room for dessert, it's totally worth it! Thanks Animal, even though I got sick and threw up, I forgive you.

Came on a Saturday night on time with reservations because heaven forbid you're late and they give your table away. Well we still waited for a table although there was one in the corner that sat empty the whole half hour we were waiting. Started with the Kale salad, not so delicious but it had the vinegary tang that was needed to cut through the richness of most of the dishes we got. Had to take bites of it throughout the meal. Chicken liver pate was good, balsamic onions were a tad sweet but it was good. Went to BLT the night before and the pate was free instead of $6. Sliders were yummy, if the buns had been toasted it would've been perfect. Rabbit Loin Spring Rolls, the green curry was a tad overwhelming at first but with the sweet eggplants and sprouts it was pretty good. Balsamic Ribs were meaty and falling off the bone. Probably because they were boiled first and then doused with the balsamic glaze. The panzanella was more of a spinach and arugula salad with fried croutons. I liked the croutons. Wanted to get the yellowtail collarbone but they were out so instead we got the Foie Gras biscuit. The foie gras itself was fine but the maple gravy was soo sweet it was almost inedible to me. I shall pass on that next time. For dessert we got the Sticky Toffee Pudding. The orange zest was a nice touch as was the sea salt. Service was ok, attentive enough with the water refills but our plates were only changed out once. Here is my qualm about this place, its not so clean. When we sat down our table was damp cause the girl had just wiped it with a damp towel but didn't dry so it was wet and sticky. The menus were filthy. It has food stains all over the entire thing, I know they change the menus regularly but they could've given us 2 without stains or just reprint them. I would probably go back but not soon.

Delicious! We called on a Saturday afternoon and they were able to slip us in at 6pm if we could finish by 7:30. My favorites: Chicken liver toast; poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar; and the hamachi tostada. (Between the 4 of us, we 5 orders of the chicken liver toast!) The foie gras loco moco was definitely delicious, but not sure it was worth $35. The pig ear with fried egg was different and pretty good too :) I'd come back !

Incredible gastronomical experience. Went here on a Tuesday around 6:30. The cute hostess was very courteous and gave us a table even without reservations. The single page menu may look sparse, and in some ways it is, but going through each item, you quickly realize that everything sounds equally delicious and better yet, interesting and complex. My friend and I opted for three dishes: the octopus, the veal brains and the bone marrow. All three were conceived in such a cerebral manner, I almost forgot that we were consuming some offal meat. The octopus was tender, as was the marrow (which was served with a chimichurri sauce and garlic toast), but my absolute favorite was the veal brains. Perfectly fried nuggets of delicate brain, served over apple puree and carrots. To finish the dish, the chef dusted the plates with vadouvan, an intensely aromatic spice blend reminiscent of garam masala. Best part of the meal for sure. Of course, we finished the meal with the bacon chocolate crunch bar (of which my friend said tasted like a gourmet snickers). Will definitely come back. A little yuppie, but hey, some pretentiousness never hurt anyone.

I've got to say, every so often it occurs to me that Vegetarians may be the visionaries of our generation.  Like the first to realize the Earth was round, women should be allowed to vote, or plague could be carried by microscopic fleas ...perhaps vegetarianism is the next great intellectual leap for human kind? Well, you can thank Animal for bitch-slapping that idea across the side of the head and dropping it to the floor like a sack of potatoes.  If Animal is any indication, God eats meat and carries a Trident with a skewered pig and cow on it. Poutine (***** Stars) - For those of you familiar with the French Canadian comfort food of french fries doused in gravy, Animal's version takes it to the next level with an amazing Oxtail ragout and some Vermont cheddar thrown on top.  The oxtail was amazing and the combination with the fries and cheese was sinful. Spare Ribs (*** Stars) - Known as one of the 'must-have items', these were good.  I found the balsamic reduction a little too concentrated and the meat solid but not necessarily fall-off-the bone great. Rabbit & Kale Ravioli in truffle butter (*****) - The surprise hit of the evening.  This was Osteria Mozza quality pasta for 1/2 price, and had a delicacy unlike the rest of the menu which tends to bash you over the head with a carnivorous sledgehammer. Quail Fry (*** Stars) -- Also known as a 'must-have' item.  It was nice and the batter tasty, but don't really get what is so special about this one and would recommend you go with something more adventurous. Wine (**** Stars) - For some reason, by-the-glass wine lists in LA tend to bite-the-big-one but Animal brings some good options to the table including a great Mourvedre. Service (***** Stars) - From the waiter, to the owners, to the guy behind the bar, great combination of competence and congeniality.  Very down to earth and knowledgeable. Decor (**** Stars) - Awesome rustic tables made from flame-torched beechwood fits with the theme of the restaurant nicely and just look cool.  Layout gives it a lively, loud feeling but not too loud to talk.  It's all good. For the vegetarian/non-carnivores out there, the menu provides kale salad, burrata, grouper, and other dishes that make it safe for all.  But hopefully by the end of the meal, they will all have been converted to the dark side.

Very unique dishes, you won't find your typical beef or chicken here. We ordered quite a few items, none of them disappointed. Balsamic ribs - my favorite dish of the night. Tender pork ribs smothered with a sweet and tangy glaze. The small arugula salad on the side was fresh and delicious. Chicken liver toast - it's basically pate on a toasted bread. The shallot balsamic glaze on top pairs well with the richness of the liver. Hamachi tostada salad - the flavors remind me of biting into a Vietnamese spring roll. It has that same minty Southeast Asian taste. Pig ears - the ears are chopped into strips and fried. They are coated with a chili lime seasoning that is similar to the flavor profiles of a chicken buffalo wing. Marrow bone - the sauce of top overpowered the taste of the marrow itself. The marrow is basically used as a spread on two pieces of crispy cheese toast. The acidity in the sauce helps cut the fatty flavors of the marrow. Crispy bacon chocolate bar - the ganache was rich and thick in chocolate flavor. The bacon taste was mild, it would be great if they added more bacon though.

Back in November, my friends and I decided to go to Animal. I made reservations the first week of December for the date I wanted but couldn't lock in the time I wanted. The best time I got was 8:45 last Friday and we still had to wait 10-15 minutes before we were seated. We ordered as I explained to the server, "a mess of things." We had three appetizers; the chicken liver toast (2 orders), the pork belly sandwiches and the foie gras sausage gravy biscuit. Everything was so good. My friends were happy and I was cheered I made a good decision on the restaurant. For our entrees, I split the loco moco and the veal breast with a friend. I loved the loco moco the last time I came in and was greatly interested in ordering the ribs but the memory of that delicious loco moco won out. Next time I'm getting the ribs though because I saw the next table's order and the rack of ribs hangs off the plate! Woah! The veal breast was great, an interesting mix of flavors and textures with the prosciutto and polenta. The gay boyfriend had the carrot salad and ricotta and goat cheese gnocchi as his main courses. I actually liked the salad which was surprisingly since I don't like carrots. And the gnocchi were so soft! Awesome gnocchi. For dessert we got the doughnuts which were great as usual as well as the bacon chocolate bar. That was okay. I've had better bacon chocolate but don't get me wrong, it's still a good thing- bacon plus chocolate equals great combination. Service was excellent. We spent about $67 each which we thought was really reasonable for all that food (2 orders of loco moco), wine and beer.

Southern cooking with a french flair twist comfort food. If you are on a diet, please stay away from this place. We came here a few months ago to celebrate a friends birthday. The decor is very minimal with the food being the focus of the restaurant and not the vibe. I opted to bring two bottles of wine and just pay for the $20 per bottle corkage fee since i didn't really see any interesting wines on their list. Our meal started with the amberjack w/ nectarines, jalapeno, citrus, and mint. The sweetness and acidity of the nectarines along with the spiciness of the jalapenos complimented the fleshy amberjack. The pork belly w/ kimchi was fatty, juicy, salty, and crispy. I wasn't too impressed with the poutine w/ oxtail gravy and cheddar. I would have preferred the traditional recipe but granted i thought the oxtail gravy was good. I did fall in love with the foie gras over biscuits topped with sausage gravy. I wish i could have this dish every sat morning for breakfast. The wifey and i opted to share the flat iron steak med rare. There were no issues with the dish. A good restaurant wouldn't be able to fuck up a dish like this. Dessert is where our meal failed us. We were full from our meal but we opted to get the bacon chocolate crunch bar. I was unhappy with our final selection. The bacon didn't really add anything to the dessert. You really couldn't taste the maple sweetness of the bacon. I was hoping for strips of bacon layered with the bar but nope the bar had small tiny bits of bacon on one side only.

This was the stupidest restaurant I have ever been to. There is no sign, except, of course, on the valet stand out front. This seems unnecessarily pretentious. It's not like this is a secret corner of the city--it's next to Canter's. My reservations were for 6 pm, when the restaurant opened. I have a 9 month old baby who is without exception perfectly behaved in restaurants, but the hostess felt the need to inform me that they had no "baby chairs," and did I still wish to be seated? She then tried to keep me standing at the front door until my entire party arrived. Keep in mind, the restaurant is totally empty at this point. In the five minutes it took the other two people to arrive, we were reminded about the need for our entire party four more times. When we tried to order appetizers, we were told we needed to order our entire meal all at once. I have since been told they were trying to get rid of us, but if that were truly the case, why did entrees arrive over an hour after the main course? By the time we finished, it was an hour past my daughter's bedtime. Despite this, she behaved PERFECTLY. Yet every time she touched the table or a napkin, they were aggressively wiped or removed. The food was 50% amazingly delicious and 50% putrid. The fish was bad. They tried to cover it with globs of disgusting tartar sauce. The foie gras was veiny and overcooked. The pork belly and quail were fabulous. The servers were total assholes, and we still tipped 15%. And before you crap on me that it's not an inappropriate restaurant for children, I will point out that they do not have an explicit anti-child policy, and as such can be expected to reasonably accommodate a very well behaved child at an early sitting. I have seen kids eating at Balthazar and Lever House in NYC, and it was a pleasure for all concerned. Animal sucks.

Animal's a great restaurant and I've been wanting to take my bf there for some time now. The last time I was there, I went with a couple of my coworkers to have dinner and was really impressed with the quality and  unique dishes. We ordered an array of items: Chicken Liver Toast $3 - I'm not a huge liver fan but this was pretty tasty..It's definitely not going to fill you up since you'll only get 2 small pieces to share amongst your friends. Crispy Hominy w/ a squeeze of lime $5: I never knew fried hominy could taste soo good. I sometimes use hominy in my soups and often times, its too soggy and dry for my taste but animals kicked it up a notch. Hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut $14: This was a bit too fishy for my taste so I didn't spend too much time on this dish. Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar $15 - I love POUTINE!! I was lucky enough to try my first poutine in Toronto, 4 years ago. All canadians love poutine, eh'? The oxtail gravy gave it a really beefy taste and I prefer the cheese curds over the cheddar that was served. Nonetheless, it was a heavy tasty dish. I felt like I gained 10lbs after eating this dish. Lamb meatballs, gold rice, green garbanzos, creme fraiche $12 - Depending on the way it was cooked, lamb often times tastes too gamey for me but the lamb meatballs were spectacular! There was no hint of lamb and the meatballs were really moist and creme fraiche was a nice touch. Pork Belly Sliders $12: Makes me scream out "GET IN MY BELLY" YUMO!!! OMG these were sooooo amazing and it just melted in my mouth. If you're in the area, I highly recommend you trying Animal. It's difficult to score a reservation but call a few days ahead and you'll be fine. Weekend reservations are a lot harder to lock in as it's generally packed solid.

The. Most. Amazing. Meal. Ever.   Like a creature out in the wild, Animal is unpretentious, raw, real.  Its interiors are simple wooden tables and chairs, its decorations are minimal, and its dishes are mostly...made of what animals would eat: Other animals. There's something about the thoughtfulness and preparation of the food that makes Animal stand out.  The "Lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac" ($10) were market fresh items I could buy from the store, but the concoction with the cruncy bits of pita adds character to the salad. One of the must try dishes was the "barbeque pork belly sandwich, with slaw" ($12, 2 sliders).  Imagine biting into a soft slider hamburger bun into flavorful coleslaw and then...wait for it...wait...for...it...a fatty, yet crispy barbeque pork belly that provides a slight crunch, but at the same time the fat melts in your mouth.  The chemistry of the coleslaw, the barbeque flavor, the texture, the taste of the pork belly sandwich made me feel like an animal...a ravenous animal wanting more... and we did get more... The foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger ($35) came as layers of these aforementioned ingredients, surrounded by rice in a slightly spicy soy-based sauce.  No hamburger bun.  Just the meat.  Like how a fancy animal would like it.  Like how I liked it.  The foie gras was definitely something else...and was one of the best foie gras dishes I've had in my life.   Finally, we finished our meal off with "bacon chocolate crunch bar" ($7), which is a must have.  Bacon and chocolate may sound odd to some, but trust me, it's worth it. The layers of creamy chocolate had surprises of crunchy, salty pieces of bacon that enhanced the chocolate flavor. Or maybe it was the chocolate that enhanced the bacon.  :) At the end of the day, this is probably one of the best meals I have had in LA.  I'll come crawling back like a ravenous animal for sure.

At these prices, I want to walk out of a restaurant like this clicking my heels and high-fiving strangers. Unfortunately, I couldn't. My party ordered several dishes, and most of them were not very good. I will just talk about the stuff that made my stomach turn. The ribs were the fattiest i had ever tasted. How can you charge so much for a such a cheap cut of meat? The Pork belly mini sandwiches were also some of the most fatty and disgusting things I have ever eaten. Here's the thing, I love meat! Meat Meat Meat! I have had much better else where. Sorry Charlie. Maybe it's not my kind of restaurant. The only thing I was able to eat were the ravioli, but nothing special there. I don't get pleasure from saying I found a place unenjoyable, but I won't be going back.

We start with the shaved asparagus ($12) with bacon, grana, croutons and a poached egg on top. The pork ribs ($15) with balsamic and giardeneria were wonderful, the meat fell of the bone as we bit into the ribs. We also order the soft shell crab ($18) served over pork belly and drizzled with a chili soy sauce. Everything was full of flavor and simple, yet delicious. My main course arrives, the fried quail ($23) served atop a bed of long cooked chard, grits, and of course, a slab of bacon. There must have been two quails on my plate, there was so much of it. No meal is complete without desert, the problem was deciding which of the five I wanted. I could have tried each one, and that's rare for me. So we settle on the bellwether ricotta drizzled with honey and served with toast ($8). We also got the white peach and blueberry crisp. Oven baked and topped with a whipped cream fraiche ($8). My full (longer) review can be read on my blog. You can find the link to Dig Lounge on my profile.

The menu here is full of indulgent, decadent, fatty dishes that leave you feeling like a ball of lard. But in the end, it's all worth trying at least once. 3.8 stars. The place is small and LOUD. Service is great. Wine selection is so-so (pinot noir was dry and fairly flat..should've gone for the italian Montalcino). On to the food. I'll warn you now - make sure to order 2-3 veggie plates. You'll definitely need it to balance out your fatty meat dishes. My date and I ordered from the small plates and were full. ** Chicken Liver Toast ($3): very grainy, muddy texture at first, but got better with each bite. It was not as good as Spotted Pig in NYC. ** Heirloom Tomato, Ginger Vinaigrette ($6): so delicious. small tomatoes topped with sprouts, onions, and a delicious, refreshing vinaigrette. Had a little kick to it, and definitely balanced out the richness of the Chicken Liver Toast ** Melted Petit Basque, Chorizo, Grilled Bread ($11): DO NOT ORDER. This was just a glorified plate of oversalted pizza hut pizza sans pizza crust & marinara. It was so salty and hard to finish. ** Pork Belly, Kimchi, Peanuts, Chili Soy, Scallion ($12): probably our favorite dish. The Pork Belly was SO MOIST and SO CRISPY on the outside. It perfectly complemented the japanese-style kimchee topping. Hands down delicious. ** Duck Confit, Farro, Green Beans, Cipollini, Lemon Chili Vinaigrette ($14): Also very delicious. The duck was SO crispy on the outside and fell right off the bone. I loved the tart farro because it balanced out the richness of the duck. This was one of my favorites, too. ** Foie Gras, Biscuit, Maple Sausage, Gravy ($22): what a disappointment!!! The stringy, chewy meat was falsely advertised as foie gras (and for $22, I was pissed!). I could barely cut the small dish apart without destroying the composition of the biscuit and sausage. When I see Foie Gras, I expect a creamy, delicate piece of joy. For dessert, we regrettingly ordered the Sticky Toffee Cake over the bacon crunch bar and joe's doughnuts. This dessert was a DENSE, sticky piece of non-moist cake, topped with a decadent toffee/caramel sauce.The only saving grace of this dessert was the trace amount of tart cream sauce. This dessert was so imbalanced and disappointing, and was even harder to eat because the cake wouldn't break apart. I give this place 4.5 stars for innovative plates, 3.5 for the hit or miss taste, and 3 for presentation/edibility. Food goes beyond looks and taste - it is also a matter of ease to the diner. I may come back here ONCE more just to try other dishes, but that's it. I'm glad I tried it, but it's just not my cup of tea.

Close your eyes and point your fingers and I am sure you will pick a delicious  creative and well prepared small plate.  We ordered the pig ears, pig head, chicken liver (the best $3 you will spend), marrow bone, poutine, hamachi, burrata, Bacon chocolate bar (by far my fav dessert there) and toffee Pudding.  I would order everything again except for the burrata and green verde sauce but it was not bad, just my least favorite. The waiter brought each item out from lightness to heaviest small plate, which was a nice touch.

Time: 10-14-10 Thursday 6:15PM   A perfect day ending for the three gnarly dude hang out: Father, Brother and myself cus they say "Time is money so we'll spend it together". Showed up to a joint with no name with no appetite but a standing reservation. The two dudes were skeptical about this place with no name but i knew it was gonna be awesome. I've been eyeing this ANIMAL for a while now therefore I was the ONLY person in our crew who was excited about this. The place was cozy yet hip yet "classy like school on a half day" - D. It was clean and simple.. i liked it. The lighting kept getting dimmed and bright.. felt like it was last call at the bar couple of times but may be it was just me eating the bone marrow cus it was that good.      Anyway, I think i got THE BEST seat in the house.. good view. A bottle of house Cab to start.. followed by the foie, marrow, belly and sweeeetbread..those 4 are the Animal's classic FOUR FRONT. I'm not gonna go into food like i got the palette made out of gold but I truly believe that you can just close your eyes and pick whatever you're pointing at and it will come out great. I'm gonna do that next time.. try something new. Nice modern American gastro cuisine with somewhat classical French foundation.. oh you fancy huh. Got the bacon crunch bar and the toffee sticky puddddding to end. It was so damn simple but indeed nice finish to the meal. Thoughts: It was nice clean flavors and dishes but for some reason.. I was expecting the grueling angry usage of Animal parts with no hesitation of breaking normal food law. I guess I was expecting the down right mastery refined animal plates such as PIGS and its cousins on a plate. For some reason it felt like the chefs had the grenade launcher with unlimited ammos but only one target.. they blew the crap out of that one target but i wish they blew up a whole town. However, It was good enough for me.

I came here last night for the first time and it was an amazing experience. I have so much to write! where do i begin?? The Low Down... You need reservations, make sure you do this otherwise you will wait a long time to just sit at the bar! When you walk in you enter a surreal environment. Everyone is pretty much high, super rich, trendy looking, or all three (including the servers). Very pricey and expensive, don't go here unless you don't care how much you're gonna spend. The dishes are very small, so you are going to order 2-3 per person and share. The Food... (We ordered their fresh brewed iced tea to drink. tasted very good) Started off with the hamachi tostada. Amazing little dish. the fish melted right in your mouth and the sauce involved was amazing. I will definitely get this every time i go here no matter what. Next we moved on to the Rabbit Sausage and Shrimp spring rolls. I had never tried rabbit before, it was very succulent. Now this is basically only one spring roll cut into three peices with a bunch of sauce and stuff for $14. but i think im crazy and thought it was worth it. The sauce was amazinggggg!!! Next we had the marrow bone chimichurri. I'm Persian so im used to eating bone marrow, but i can imagine this would be a good experience for people that had never had it before. This dish is a little on the heavier side, but good! Our last of the dishes was the melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread. This is a very cheesy dish. It is a hot skillet of sizzling petit basque cheese, with pepperoni underneath. It is served with chrilled bread. Very delicious (I Love Cheese!!) and again this dish is on the heavier side. We closed our food portion of our meal with dessert. We got the Tres Leches!! It was so good, not too soggy and perfect amount of caramel underneath to add that extra twist of sweetness to it. The Service... Great overall. Our server was attentive, kept our iced teas refilled. Even brought an extra little pitcher of iced tea to keep at our table in case we wanted to refill on our own. Brought the check immediately when asked for. I didnt feel neglected at all, but at the same time they dont kiss your ass like you are the god of the universe. I loved this! I think it was the perfect median of service. Overall, Animal is an experience. A great one at that! From beginning to end you feel as if you are experiencing something new in your life and thats what a great restaurant should always be. Some people might think its overpriced or what-not but I believe its worth the experience you have for the evening. I will be coming back again to experience this place with different friends and try new dishes!

Heaven. My fiancee actually told me he was in heaven halfway through our meal here....and he's a hard dude to impress. I decided to take him here for his birthday after hearing a few people rave about this place. And since we both love meat AND I got him a bottle of 99 Chateauneuf Du Pape for his present, I figured it would be appropriate. We started with 2 glasses of sparkling wine and a small heirloom tomato plate. The heirloom tomatoes were served with some microgreens and a ginger garlic vinaigrette. Can't really go wrong with that! I loved the fresh mint on top. Just enough to surprise you but not too much to overpower the taste of the tomato. My only gripe here is that I wish they served bread so I could've mopped up the yummy sauce. Then out came the poutine and the bbq pork belly sliders. The poutine was delicious. It was topped with oxtail gravy and a 10 year old aged white cheddar - and was killer with the wine. The bbq pork belly sliders (2 per order) were really good. The slaw and the bbq sauce were amazing. I kinda wish they served the slaw on the side so I could have more of it - it was so good. It was very mustard-y yet still sweet. The bbq sauce was amazing. I want to buy a bottle of it and put it on everything. I had never tried pork belly before and it was a little bit too "fatty" for me. The texture was a bit too chewy for my liking, but it still had a great flavor. For our entrees, we got the halibut topped with king crab and served with corn and a tabasco butter sauce along with the flat iron steak with asaparagus hash and a truffle parmesan fondue.  Yep - also amazing! Even though halibut is a lighter flaky fish, it still went surpringsly well with the wine. The flavors were amazing. The tabasco sauce had just the right hint of tabasco. I'm not a huge tabasco person and feel like people tend to overdo it with it, but this worked really well. The steak was perfectly cooked medium rare, just how I like it. I had to pace myself while eating this. I could've easily finished it in 2 bites. I loved the asparagus hash. It's much more enjoyable eating asparagus that way. We were pretty full after all this, but we HAD to try the bacon chocolate crunch bar. No birthday is complete without something sweet! They brought it out with a little lit candle for him which was a darling and sweet touch. And.....OMG. Sex on a plate. The chocolate was so rich and dense, almost like it was a truffle in bar form. I was a bit scared about the bacon on top. I've had bacon pancakes before and it was not as good as I imagined. However, the bacon added just the right about of crunch and saltiness to the dense & sweet chocolate. But, the salt and pepper creme anglaise was really the "icing on the cake", so to speak. Amazing. Had I not felt as though I wanted to explode from eating all of the delicious food, I would've ordered another one. Aside from the food, the service was great. The hostess was very sweet and walked around and filled up water when she wasn't busy. The bartender, who seemed to be the manager, also stopped by the table to make sure everything was going good. Our server was very genuine, cool and laid back. He wished my dude happy birthday in a way that sounded like he really meant it. Not just an obligiatory "happy birthday, sir". Plus, he didn't get bent that we brought our own wine and did a great job decanting it. The decor in the space was very minimal, but I loved that. I felt like the food that came out of their kitchen was worthy of the fanciest looking restaurant in LA. But, the space is very plain, modest and clean looking. No frills, not even a sign, to distract you from the beautiful food. Plus, any place that doesn't stick their noses up at me and my fiancee's tattoos and compliments them instead, is pretty rad in my book. I hate dressing up (or down, rather) to go out to eat. This is my new favorite place in LA. I'll be back...soon.

Is it wrong that I had two dinners last night--the first at the strictly Vegan Real Food Daily and the second at the ode-to-carnivory Animal?  Of course not!  I'm a woman of extremes, after all. My first clue as to what was in store for me at Animal was when they brought out the BALSAMIC REDUCTION PORK RIBS ($37) without a steak knife.  How was I supposed to cut this humongous slab of meat that looked like it was dipped in the La Brea Tar Pits?  Not to worry. My little pinky could have cut it.   Lucky for my dining companion, I opted to use the butter knife instead of my pinky, and when I did, the meat literally fell off the bone.  I took a little home with me as leftovers and the next day when I was eating it, I actually ATE THE BONE. It was as soft as the meat. Hey, I can always use the extra calcium in my diet.   The balsamic reduction that is slathered on the ribs is incredibly concentrated.  I was in heaven for the first few ribs.  After that, however, the flavor got a little too much for me.  It's funny how your taste buds change after a few bites... We also ordered the FOIE GRAS WITH BISCUIT and maple sausage gravy ($20), which was my first time eating foie gras.  I expected something bigger, but I forgot that the pictures on Yelp make everything seem bigger than they actually are.   The dish was pretty small.  Anyway, the same thing happened as it did with the ribs--eyes rolled back, pupils glazed over, and I was in gustatory bliss for my first few bites.  After those few bites, however, the dish became too sweet for me and I couldn't finish it. Finally, we got the BACON CHOCOLATE BAR ($8).  The smokiness of the bacon was perfect with the dark chocolate.  It was like that awesome chocolate bacon bar they sell at Whole Foods, but even better because the chocolate was darker.  I only wished there were more bacon in the dessert.  You can never have enough bacon. I was hemming and hawing about what rating to give Animal, and I opted on 4 stars, with the intent of coming back and upping it if need be.  The Loco Moco and Pork Belly App sound especially enticing for my next visit.   The best thing about Animal? It's open until 2 am on Friday and Saturday! We came at midnight after a late show at Largo (yes, you must see Jon Brion on Fridays! go!), and it was wonderfully empty.  No longer do I have to rely on In-N-Out and Norms for late night munchies! *See pics*

Came here for a Pop-Up with NYC's Cafe Boulud last week. It was truly an unforgettable meal. Definitely could've done with a LOT more Spaghetti Nero (my favorite dish of the night) and caper crusted lamb loin though. Service staff was very attentive and we didn't feel rushed at all, despite the restaurant being completely sold out and super busy. I'll be back soon to try the real Animal menu. Son of a Gun's also next on my list!

I'll admit that I walked into animal with several flawed assumptions. First, that scene would outweigh substance. And second, that its porcine-centric concept would get in the way of execution. Fortunately, I was wrong on both counts. The fallacy of a clearly defined "concept" is the sword of Damocles for countless chefs and restaurateurs. Regardless of what Top Chef's restaurant wars have taught us about concept (Pier One Buddha statues + braised short ribs = contemporary pan-Asian!), great food can be just that without having to sacrifice creativity for marketability. This is perhaps the greatest challenge for the chefs at animal; overcoming the narrow "everything is better with bacon" ethos that their surprisingly diverse menu has been saddled with. At the risk of repeating what's already been covered by countless other reviewers, I will state that animal is one the best meals in town. To my earlier point, several standout dishes, including a flawlessly prepared branzino, contain no trace of pork. The wine list is as varied as it is reasonably priced. The service is friendly and informal. And the space is deceptively understated, with details that reveal design savvy. I look forward to seeing what these chefs do next. Whatever it is, I hope that they put some distance between themselves and the cable network that may have birthed the whole carniwhore trend with the cringe-inducing mantra "pork fat rules."

Still awesome when I went there last weekend to get some tres leches. Good to know that only 3 menu items are available to go: BBQ pork belly sliders, tres leches, and bacon chocolate crunch bar. The first two are awesome enough that I could make a meal out of it. Service was great even though all I was doing was ordering a $7 slice of cake. Everyone from the hostess to the waiters made sure I was taken care of and gave me a glass of water as I sat at the bar waiting for my cake.

Every week I drive down Fairfax on my way to The Dime, a local dive bar.  Just across the street sits a building free from signs or advertising.  By chance one day I needed to use their valet parking and decided to pop in.  NO REGRETS!!!  Animal is a very classy place where fellowship by the staff and owners is not sacrificed to style and swagger.   Not only is it trendy, stylish and exudes relaxation, it also happens to have killer food prepared by some of the cities best chefs and perfect wine to go along with it! Animal is the one of the rare gems in LA and one of the perfect starter spots for any night of the week.  Order the duck and the ribs, then ask Jeff behind the bar for his best wine!  He'll have stomach singing and your tongue dancing with all the rich tastes and phenomenal ambiance. Go there and enjoy!

Animal is top-knotch.  They use high-quality, seasonal ingredients.  The menu is always changing to keep up with whatever produce is available.   I arrived for dinner hungry and the petit basque cooked in a small bowl was about the most satisfying thing I have ever eaten.   The warm heirloom spinach salad with a poached egg really had my number.  And the balsamic vinegar pork ribs were off the hook.   What more is there to say? Chefs Jon and Vinny are both respectful of the culinary arts and dedicated to creating new and tasty dishes.  They will help you remember that you are living the good life.

This place is over hyped, and I tried just about everything ppl were raving out.  foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, bone marrow, veal brain, quail fry, chocolette bacon dessert, chicken liver toast, and i was highly dissapointed.  Everything was over salted and the only thing worth it was experiencing the famous "Animal" and checking out this hyped restaurant first hand.   The place is small and quaint, the crowd is nice, dressy casual, theres alot of ppl dressed smart, valet I believe is $5, and booking a place here over the weekend is almost impossible.  weekdays are better, and even so, you have to book it a day or two in advance.  It gets busy in here.

This is one true foodie experience, that was even better because I enjoyed it with another gf who shares the same love of food as I do. The name of the restaurant says it all, Animal. So all vegetarians and faint of heart of other parts of carnivore, don't even bother. Animal has a clean upscale gastropub feel with tasting plates of complex combinations that will blow your mind. I always talk about food first, then experience last. We ordered 4 plates to share between the two of us, which was perfect. By far the best plate of the night was the foie gras terrine. The combinations of the foie gras and prosciutto in the terrine with the date butter on the crispy toasty buttery bread is literally a party in your mouth. I am usually a seared foie gras girl myself, but this terrine was one of the best foie gras dishes I've had. I was not a fan so much of the yellowtail collar we ordered, the spice rub was extra powerful and masked what usually is a delightful fish! Quite the disappoinment. Maybe we should have stuck with the Animal parts and not the seafood. By the time dessert came around, we were stuffed, but dessert was a must. We ordered the bacon chocolate bar with S&P ice cream. Again an usual combination, but together was very good. I could have probably devoured the whole thing if I wasn't overly stuffed from all the other plates. The bar is beer and wine only, but the wine selection that my waiter recommended was great. The service was perfect, very attentive staff, helpful waiters and everyone is very friendly. Just beware, parking is scarce on Fairfax so make sure you give yourself ample time to get there, because they'll only give you a 15 minute grace period from your reservation time. Thank god they do have valet service should you not be successful on the street.

This is a small cozy restaurant with a very loud atmosphere (literally loud). Décor was minimal with clean lines. Our server was friendly and she helped us go over the menu with her favorite picks. After the great debate AK and I ordered three dished to share. Pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg :: I know what you're thinking, "Pig ears ahhh!" Seriously, it tasted like small, thin, strips of bacon and not chunky cartilage. How can you hate bacon!?! This dish was surprisingly spicy and the lime made the dish tangy. I do feel that the egg soften the dish and pulled all the flavors together. Without the egg, the flavors from the chili and lime were too intense. BBQ pork belly sandwich :: Sha-zaam this was tasty! The bbq sauce had a hint of sweetness and smokiness which wasn't overpowering. The pork belly was tender to the taste. The sweet/smokiness of the sauce, the creaminess of the slaw, the tender pork belly, and the crisp refreshing slaw paired together making this a very balanced and tasteful treat. Foie gras loco moco :: I hesitate with foie gras because if it's prepared poorly is just ends up tasting like solidified fat. This wasn't the case. The sweetness of the teriyaki sauce and spam meshed well with the creaminess of the froie gras made me smile. I appreciate the recreation of comfort food by using good quality ingredients but they were very heavy dishes. I'm speaking on behalf of the meat dishes!

I admire simplicity. Animal doesn't bother with the trappings of style; the walls are bare, the menu is a single sheet of paper. No one wears a bow tie. Also, they have Miller High Life and Milwaukee's Best on the drink menu. That's how you make friends. The food is also simple, but in a way that shows thought was put into the way it would taste. A fresh and light appetizer of raw tuna with fruit and chilis prepared my palate. A tasty quail fry over thick slices of bacon wasn't heavy, but with just enough savory sauce. And what's not to love about a deep dark crunch bar where bacon bits serve as crispies? Nothing. Exactly. Plus by including meat in dessert I was able to hit the trifecta of Sea, Air, and Land in three courses for under $50 by sharing the before and afters. Bonus points!

Let me just go out on the record and say that this is easily my favourite restaurant in LA. These chefs knows exactly how to mix acidity in with fat in order to cut the richness. Another FANTASTIC talent of there's is taking American comfort food and putting a gorgeous twist on it. Its comfortable yet fancy, and most importantly each bite is decadent and melts in your mouth. You know its good when each bite that you take, your eyes shut, and you do a little moan at the end. This pair is ORGASMICLY AMAZING. My new favourite and I think it will stay this way for a while, is the Foie Gras Biscuits and Gravy. I ate every little bite of this dish and then contemplated licking the bowl. I was so sad at the end of this dish. I imagined a kiddie pool filled with this dish so that I could dive in Eyes Wide Shut, but Mouth Wide Open to gobble down all of this goodness. This time around I did a bunch of small plates and one large plate and we all shared. We had the Petite Basgue. Cheese lover or not, I can not imagine anyone complaining about this dish. The toast was toasted with just a sliver of garlic on it to give it the perfect taste with the petit basque, then the chorizo baked in the petit basque was perfect in cutting the richness of the cheese. They are brilliant. I had the BBQ Pork Belly sandwiches. Gimme gimme, gimme MORE! I had the pork belly Kim Chi slaw again, perfection! Our last dish were the Pork Ribs. My friend isn't a pork rib lover, but let me tell you that he had 5 pieces. Yes its that good.

UPDATE: 6/27/10 Review changed from 4**** to 5 ***** because it is the best food I have had in LA to date (from a restaurant that is still open). Not to mention, a relatively good value. When compared to everyone else, they deserve all five. Congratulations Animal. --------------------------------------------------?-------------------------- I like the concept; gourmet ingredients and flavors presented in a casual and forgiving atmosphere. Besides the great service, one of the most notable accomplishments achieved in the array of courses I sampled was that they were successful, yet diverse in style. A polycultural menu which succeeded in many arenas. Everything from the middle eastern inspired lamb chop with yogurt sauce to the Thai-Korean inspired pork belly to the elegant fish ceviche were all delicious---yet so different from each other! Well done! The only real setback as far as dishes goes were the sweetbreads. The citrus/acid element in the dish overpowered the flavor of the sweetbreads and even the hen-of-the-woods mushrooms they were served with. That sorta made me sad. But everything else was either good, or excellent. The foie gras appetizer was too sweet for me, but was very tasty nevertheless. The ceviche dish with some white fish, nectarines and mandarin orange was the best ceviche-like dish I have ever had. As far as service, they brought out no more than 3 appetizers at a time even though we ordered eight---which I was very happy about. I hate being bombarded at the table with too many courses. Good perception on their part. The dinner was a little fast paced, but so is LA, and the atmosphere in the restaurant. Ordering mainly appetizers is a good idea! The one main we shared was delicious, but was the same size as the appetizers...and twice the price. Think about it. My parents gave a high and appropriate compliment when they said "it was interesting, but good". Many restaurants succeed in the former, but fail in the latter it seems. Not Animal! Good and interesting work :) Desserts were good, not a stale afterthought like they often are at many good restaurants. Had the bacon bar and apricot tart with pistachio creme anglaise. They seemed to have made the tart with dried/partially reconstituted apricots which prevented a mushy tart crust and kept a nice apricot flavor---notable technique! My party of four (which is a great number to go with) sampled a total of eight appetizers, one main course, and two desserts. Expect to pay about $70 a person if you want to include ample booze, tax, and tip. I would go back. I would not change much. The music was louder than I would have liked, but that was the only thing that I would have changed (you can't tell the loud people there to quiet down afterall). ---Anthony

L.a. needs more of this! Culinary debauchery!!! This is everything I want in a restaurant! Excessive flavor over the top concepts, and execution in preparation! The wow factor is in effect, actually it's more like a holyshit factor! I think I blurted that out a few times during the course of the meals I've had here. So onto the food Quail fry with grits, chard, bacon lards, & a maple jus. Just think of a southern breakfast, some of the best damn grits I've had before, the greens were like my mothers!!! The quail batter was down-home crispy and flavorful, the maple jus & bacon made it all pop. A+ pork belly sliders: Best slider ive ever had! This took me right to a picnic with a taste of a seasoned grillmaster working the grill, this belly was cooked beyond perfect! with a down south perfect bbq sauce on it. So good me and my son smiled the whole time we ate it A+ Bone marrow with chimichurri, caramelized onions my son loved this, I personally thought marrow just wasn't my thing, ate it all of this one. Though  I think would like it more  with something other than chinichurri, but that's a personal preference A pig ear,chile,lime,fried egg: this was interesting, they were fired crispy, and the lime and chile gave it a nice tangy spicy punch! Reminded me of bacon & eggs sunny side up with chaluda hot sauce on it! lol A Pig tails buffalo style,ranch & celery: This was fun and tasty!! we polished every last one off!. The first bite taste just like a damn hotwang!!! Deep fried with a crisp outer skin and tender in the inside, an old fashioned buffalo sauce on and ranch smired across the plate! A+ Grilled octopus, chorizo,chow-chow: This has by far been the best octopus dish ive had, it was cooked perfect & tender no rubber with an amazing flavor!! The chorizo grilled was perfect too and it matched like PB&j ! A+ Sweetbreads, creamed spinach,capers,oyster mushrooms: Another delicious dish! Sweetbread battered with a nice little crisp  on the skin, creamy in the middle, the mushrooms & the cream spinach went with it perfect!, flavors popping everywhere! A Crispy Rabbit legs,yellow wax beans,purslane, bacon lardons, and some kick ass sauce I cant recall? : This was off the chain! I didnt know what to expect, once again everything meshed perfect together the crisp crunchy wax beans, and the crunchy bite your finger off bacon lardons mixed with that creamy sacue!!!! The rabbit leg was fried like chicken, perfectly moist and tender in the inside! I had a case of the turrets while eating this! A+ Foie gras Loco Moco,: This was perfect! I could of done without the spam personally. A Deserts: bacon chocolate crunch bar: this is damn good! Hersheys should make this! I would actually like if there was more presence of the bacon! Tres leches, dulce de leche : My son loved this, I didnt care for it. Panna cotta, santa rosa plum : this was light and refreshing after all that savorynesss the plum sauce was comes through strong. Ill be back for the rest of the menu soon!!!!!!

My recommendation is to go with a small group (4 is a good number) and order a bunch of appetizers.  They are filling and more exciting than the entrees.  The poutine was great, as was the basque with chorizo.  The house red wine was a great buy at $20 to the bottle. I really liked this place: the food was good, the service was great and the ambiance was very cool.  I definitely want to go back. --- Take Metro #10, 14, 217, 218, 714, 780.

Ok so my ex-gf Josefa C., super friends Kevin C. and Peter P. were going to go and try this Italian spot in Beverly Hills when Kevin C., Peter P. and I conspire to convince my ex to go try out Animal... Two hours later we are canceling reservations at a chef's table to try out my new favorite spot.   When we arrive at Animal, we are pleasantly greeted by the hostess and given a prime table in the middle of the place. We asked if they offer a chf's table which they do not, but they did offer to have the chef come out and make their recommendations.  We decided to go off what our waitress recommended for appetizers and explore the menu for ourselves. For app's we started with the BBQ Pork Belly Sliders (***** stars) which were moist, tender and sooo good.  We also had the Grilled Squid, Chorizo, Chimichurri (**** 1/2 stars)  The chorizo was an excellent addition which gave the dish an earthy taste.  But for me the Head Cheese Dip (***** stars) was the shining star.  Not having ever tasted it, I was blown away by the flavor and texture of the dish. For entrees we shared two Loco Moco Foie Gras Quail Egg, Spam, and Hamburger (***** stars) which words cannot describe.  When it first came out my friends stared at me and asked how I thought it was...  Al I could do was smile as the food and flavor was exploding in my mouth. We also had Balsamic Pork Ribs served with Succotash and Herb Butter (***** stars) the ribs slid off the bone and were perfectly flavored. After having devoured all this flesh, we finished our meal sharing a Blueberry Tart (**** stars) Chocolate Crunch Bar (**** stars) and a devilish slice of Tres Leches (***** stars) Oh how I wish I still lived in L.A.!!!

If you take any of the following medications: Lipitor, Mevacor, Pravachol, Zocor, Lescol, Crestor, Altocor.... don't come to eat here, you will get a heart attack. My favorite dish here was the foie gras maple gravy biscuit dish. It's a mixture of sweet and savory in your mouth... it makes my mouth water thinking about that dish.  Second favorite was the Pork ribs which have a slightly tart taste mixed with savory. They have other dishes like Loco Moco (non Hawaiian style),   I think what keeps the hype of this place is the fact they do Not let you take any of the dishes for take out except like 3 dishes. I wanted to take home an order of the fois gras dish but it's not allowed ! I did like that the portions were small so you can sample a little of everything. The waiters were all really nice. The wine was good.Expect to spend about 50+ to get a good amount of foods+a little wine. Don't show up late to your reservation or you won't get your seats~ Come early and you can drink some wine / beer before they seat you. Decor is that minimalist stuff...which I don't really like. 2 skulls on the wall that's all I remember. I'll go again in the future and maybe my review will improve.

Wow...I haven't been to this great a restaurant in a long time.  In a nutshell, I'd love to come back again and have them surprise me with whatever they have on the menu that day. First, the basic stuff:   Make reservations.  Not a table was empty when we got there.  At 8pm, the place was packed.  The ambience was a little loud, but when you pack that many people in a small, bare-bone decorated room, you're gonna have to get a little loud to carry a conversation.  That's ok... Parking.  There's no adjacent parking lot for the restaurant.  There is a valet which I highly suggest you use.  According to the valet, they park your car in a garage some blocks away from the restaurant which is a much better solution than if you wanna waste time looking for a spot around Fairfax.  We paid $5.50 for valet and $1 tip.  It is soooo worth it. Signage.  There is no sign, just a black facade with tables in the interior of the building.  The restaurant is a couple of storefronts away north of Canters Deli.  Now you know...and knowing is half the battle (Yo Joe!!!). No modifications.  I love it when a restaurant doesn't let you change your selection.  It shows the restaurant's dedication to the culinary masterpieces they're presenting to you.  Just read the menu, ask questions and know your allergies. Wine List.  The list isn't big, but from the three wines I had, they were tasty and well kept.  Price wise- the bottles were reasonably priced and not over blown.  The per-glass prices were a little pricier, which should lead you to just drop the extra money on a bottle instead.  The 2005 Australian Pinot Noir had a slighty jammy taste to it which wasn't too thick and reminded me of some the better grade Pinot Noir's from Santa Barbera's Santa Ynez area.  Not too overly spicy, which went great with the appetizers (listed below).  On the other hand, the Zin I ordered had a little spice in it which went great with my pork chops.  To round out our desserts, my group had ordered a bottle of Moscato which put a nice touch of bubbly, apple flavored texture to our palates. Appetizers.  We were a small group of seven, so we went for a few different dishes.  What stood out for me, the most, were the pork ribs.  Very delicately presented, they came off the bone and had a tasty, semi sweet braise on them.  The quantity was good and splitting them amongst the seven of us was effortless.  I never had foie gras before, so for me this was just as a pleasant surprise.  The petite basque was perfectly balanced and the flavor was not outdone by the saltiness you usually get out of melted cheese.  It was just right.  The house smoked pork belly was so good, that the fourteen pieces the two strips were cut into, disappeared off the plate like crazy. Entree.  I ordered the pork chops.  The serving was great.  Two decently sized cuts topped with a tasty garnish.  I'm so glad I ordered the Zin at this point, because they both went so well together.  The meat was tender and tasted great.  I had no problem finishing both pieces...  I also got to taste the turbot (white fish) my wife ordered.  It may have been on the smaller side, but I'd still recommend it, especially for those of you with small, but eccentric appetites.   Dessert.  For the five remaining occupants at our table, we ordered three desserts.  what stood out for me was the bacon chocolate crunch bar.  The slight saltiness of the bacon and the sweetness of the dark chocolate in the bar was not conflicting at all.  Even though I should have had a glass of Port with this dessert, the Moscato did not kill the experience.  We also had the blueberry coffee cake which was good, but for me dessert was all about the bacon chocolate crunch bar. The bill.  4 appetizers, 6 entrees, 2 bottles and 1 glass of wine, and 3 desserts later the bill was over $400.   Was it worth it???  Yes.

Have to admit I was a little wary of eating at a restaurant called Animal. I'm not really a meat eater so I wasn't sure if there would be much on the menu for this pescatarian.  One of my dining companions, Dawson S, was sweet enough to call ahead and got assurance that I'd have plenty to eat. And I sure did... Our table of 4 ordered the following: Arugula, apple, grapes, pine nuts, white balsamic, parmesan Grilled squid, chorizo, chimichurri Pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg Foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger Ricotta & goat cheese gnocchi, early girl pomodoro The salad was uh-mazing...the fresh parmesan on it made it extra tasty! And the grilled squid hit the spot as well. However, the pig ear was the winner of the night! I may not be a steak eater, but apparently I really like pig ear. Who knew?   Not so uh-mazing... The foie gras dish didn't really do it for me! I blame my dad for sending me too many videos of duck torture.  And the gnocchi didn't taste any better than the frozen gnocchi I buy at Trader Joe's. I was really looking forward to the bacon chocolate crunch bar for dessert, but I liked the brown butter berry tart MUCH better. Oh, and for a restaurant called Animal I found the atmosphere kind of boring.  I was expecting to see some skinned animals on the walls, but no sign of animals besides that delicious pig ear on my plate.

My dinner at Animal was an amazing birthday gift from two friends of mine. And it was one hell of a birthday gift I tell you whut.   Two words: Pig's Ear.   Chopped and fried pig's ear topped with an egg and lots of hot sauce.   It could be the breakfast of kings, sir, and yet, it can only be had at dinner at this meatastic outpost.  Can someone else in town PLEASE serve pig's ear like this for breakfast?   We also had a Basque cheese + chorizo app (ho jeeze, salty cheesy goodness), tiny fried quails (a little hard to eat/share between 4 folks), and liver bruschetta (Mozza's might be better). The famous Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar was indeed splendid but part of me is torn about which is better, this guy, or the rather American simplicity of Nickel Diner's bacon donut.   I would definitely go back although places like Animal (and Nickel Diner) are *clearly* shortening my life one meal at a time.

I keep hearing about this place so I decided to take couple coworkers there to try it out.  I don't really consider the food exotic.  You can get most of these stuffs in asian and non-American restaurants. Pork belly sandwich - this was good, wish there was more meat though Poutine - unusual combination, but the ox tail and the fries were both very good Hamachi tosada - good, the dressing is good Quail fry - this was good.  wish there was more Sweetbread - ok, sweetbread doesn't have much taste Lamb sausage - ok, too salty and too much garlic butter The price was okay, a bit more than what I would like to pay for this kind of quality.  Overall, good service and decent food.

Oh Animal, I would be 'lion' if I said I didn't have the best experience ever.  Har Har.  :P My boyfriend surprised me on this romantic date to Animal.  It was delicious.  The service was perfect.  The setting was nice.   We ordered the crispy hominy (forgettable, and not worth getting in my opinion), a beet salad (great for cleansing your palate before the meal), the foie gras loco moco (holy amazingness), and the bacon chocolate crunch bar with s&p anglaise (by this point, you are collapsing with over-enjoyment). The foie gras loco moco~ I can't even describe with words all the different flavors it had to create the perfect combination.  The quail egg, the spam, the fattiest piece of foie gras.  It was absolutely divine.  If it hadn't been such a fancy restaurant, I would have gone animal and licked the plate.  Okay, that was my last bad joke.   And the bacon bar.  I was scared to try it.  But for some reason, the saltiness of the bacon was the perfect touch to the chocolate bar.  Perfect!  I dream about it.  An ocean away, but I will be back! So good job boyfriend.  I love you even more.  ;)

Had the bone marrow, which wasn't for me. The chimichurri sauce was a nice contrast, but it was a texture thing for me. My fellow diners loved it. Balsamic ribs were flavorful but unremarkable. Poutine was rich. Like the most posh Greek diner fries you ever tasted. Octopus and chorizo was killer. Tender and smoky with a little sweetness from the chow chow. I abstained from the foie gras biscuit, but fellow diners loved it. Purslane salad had fantastic creme fraiche "ranch" dressing, but beware that the succulent plant kind of had an okra, slimy texture, if that bums you out. A fellow diner had the quail fry and devoured it. The Bacon crunch bar was dense and definitely shareable. A couple bites is all you need. Tres leches cake was excellent. I definitely want to return and try more of the menu, since it changes daily.

Went to animal on vacation with my family. small dining area so call for reservations. we sat at the bar comfortably (three of us) The service was exceptional!! i have worked in restaurants my whole life. everyone from the bar tender to the servers to the back waiters were knowledgeable about the menu, food and went out of their way to check in on us. The food was the best dinner i have ever had in my life, HANDS DOWN i didnt want to waist valuable room on dessert because i dont have a sweet tooth so when my mom was sipping a coffee i was pounding Pork belly sliders. i wanted everything on the menu. as soon as im back on the west coast i will return for more!

I've had Animal bookmarked for quite some time now and, after finally dining here this past Saturday, I can see that all the rave reviews for this restaurant are definitely well deserved. There were no available reservations until 10:45pm for Saturday so my boyfriend and I attempted to wing it and get open seating at the bar right when the restaurant opened.  Of course with our luck LA traffic was horrendous so by the time we arrived, we were one seat short from having a comfortable meal at the bar.  I was about to let out my sad sigh when the hostess suggested that we just eat at the side of the bar - sans actual seating - and just wait for other patrons to finish.  Not the most ideal way to eat but we came on a mission and so stand and eat we did...until another party of two finished their meal at the bar and we were able to scoot over to their seats, yay! It was actually quite pleasant sitting at the bar.  The bartender was  friendly and very helpful in providing recommendations. We started off with a bottle of Anjou per the bartender's recommendation.  It was a light and very pleasing complement to the dishes that we ordered which were as follows: Pig Ears I've never had pig ears before so this was a surprisingly tasty dish.  The pig ears are cooked to a nice crisp and is accompanied by a perfectly fried egg.  It also had a nice kick all around.  I'm wondering if this is the chef's spin on bacon and eggs.   Bone Marrow By far the best bone marrow that I've had!  Topped with chimichurri and caramelized onions and accompanied by two pieces of delicious toast.  It was bone marrow perfection.  I could have eaten this dish by myself.  Actually, we most likely will be ordering our own bone marrows the next time we eat at Animal. Pork Belly Sandwiches I was very impressed with how tender and juicy the pork belly was prepared.  These sliders were very tasty and definitely worth the resulting messiness.   Oxtail and Cheddar Poutine I love poutine and Animal does a nice take on this dish although it was slightly on the salty side. The serving size is quite substantial so I would recommend ordering this as something to share amongst more than 2 people. Foie Gras Loco Moco I love foie gras but I must say that I did not particularly love this dish.  To be honest, it was my least favorite out of all the dishes that we tried.  Quail egg atop foie gras atop spam atop a hamburger patty atop a bed of rice. Overkill. The foie gras itself was nicely prepared but I think the combination of spam and hamburger patty overshadowed the overall flavor of the foie gras.  The dish was much too savory for my taste. Overall, Animal makes for a fantastic casual dining experience.  The ambiance is lovely, the service is friendly and on point, and the food is mouth wateringly good.  It really is an indulgent meal that perhaps may raise your cholesterol level more than a few points but it's well worth it. Total price per person: $65 for 5 dishes and a bottle of red.

Thank God fish can be considered an honest meat, because I wouldn't have known what to do if I couldn't partake in testing out the wonders that abound at Animal. I was entertaining a meat-fanatic friend (yes, of course a boy) on his birthday and from what I'd heard of Animal, it sounded like the perfect place. That, and the fact that any young, rockstar chef can cook me whatever they darn well please. Granted, knowing that my stomach does not exactly favor the cows and pigs side of the meat spectrum, I had a vision that I might spend the night picking at various lettuce leaves. As we sat at the bar waiting for a table, sipping some wine, and catching Vinny's tatt-sleeved arm carefully manning the stove, I couldn't help but drool at the many passing plates of Petit Basque. As the pungent hot, melted cheese wafted its way over to my nose I threw out any inhibitions about chorizo and decided a head first dive into their "most popular appetizer" was a must. The cheese came out still sizzling and the little chorizo discs hiding underneath were so good I was not one bit ashamed to scarf them down. On to course #2 - I went for the Monkfish - aka the "Poor Man's Lobster" - which came out beautifully plated with mini clams, sausage bites, sourdough croutons to mop up the juices, and covered with grilled peppers. I'd never had Monkfish before but I think after this version it might not be worth trying to top it! The Flat Iron seems to be well documented already, so I'll just attest that the birthday boy thought there could be no better present than that perfect piece of steak sitting happy in his tummy. Sadly, there was no bacon chocolate bar on the dessert menu, so we decided to forego dessert until our next visit. Needless to say, that won't be too long from now!

Eating bacon three courses in a row (appetizer, entree, dessert) is an amazing thing. Doing it without even setting out to as, let's say, part of your plan to stage the "world's most delicious suicide," is even more amazing. And it means you're in a pretty special place. Animal is that place. Go there and discover, as I did, that there's no wrong way to eat bacon.

With a name like Animal I was expecting some kind of jungle-themed restaurant with leopard, tiger, or zebra print all over, but I was wayyy off. This place is the most minimalist you can get with a restaurant. http://static.px.yelp.co… Even on the outside there are no signs, not even the address is marked so keep an eye out for the valet. Also it helps to know that Canter's is just a couple doors down. Ok on to the food...our small party of three ordered: 1. Ricotta & goat cheese gnocchi with early girl pomodoro http://static.px.yelp.co… 2. Amberjack, nectarine, citrus, mint, and chili http://static.px.yelp.co… 3. Quail fry with grits, chard, slab bacon and maple jus http://static.px.yelp.co… 5. Pork belly topped with kimchi, peanuts, chili soy and scallions http://static.px.yelp.co… 4. Foie gras with a biscuit and maple sausage gravy http://static.px.yelp.co… Our server, Jeff did suggest we order dishes and share like tapas style, he also told us in which order the dishes will be served. Foie gras last because it is such a rich dish. The amberjack was pretty good, fresh and very light. The gnocchi was pretty ok, I'm not a big fan of goat cheese but the flavor wasn't so goat-y =P but the texture was good but I love the gnocchi better at Osteria la Buca. The quail was my favorite! Very moist and the spices and herbs worked well together. the chard, grits and maple sauce were amazing! The pork belly with kimchi was ok, not too spicy but I wished the pork belly had a little crisp to it. Foie gras was really good too. The mix with the gravy and biscuit yummm! My girlfriends and I definitely enjoyed our meal. The service here was great as well. Animal has not seen the last of me!

*Bump *Bump *Bump Sitting next to the kitchen/bar was like sitting next to the bathroom, only worse, because the food flew by your head, too. Came here for a dinner with four last night. Sat in a chair and my chair was literally kicked multiple times by the WAITERS as they traversed to/from the kitchen. I tried to push my chair towards the table until I was an inch away; that didn't work. I tried putting my purse on my chair; it fell when one waiter knocked it off. Goodness. On to the food. The general gist: it was too much of much. Mind you, I love great food and am willing to experiment, but duck, goose, pork and beef fat alone doesn't cut it for me. Hamachi tostada: The lightest dish of the night, which was what they started us off with - fresh hamachi sat under a flowery array of herbs mixed with peanuts and red, raw, and more raw onions. I ended up picking some onions out just so I could taste the other fresh ingredients. Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy: I have to hand it to them; the biscuit and gravy brought me childhood breakfast memories of pancakes, eggs and sausages. The foie gras was just enough for four to share. This was probably the best dish of the night. Duck confit, apricot, marcona almonds, dates, arugula: One crispy leg of a duck. That's it. A bit dry, but it was almost fried. Yeah. The orange sauce dotted around it was awesome dressing with the arugula. Rabbit loin, country ham, spring beans, spaetzle: I love rabbit (sorry, Thumper). This was done with a few oddly-shaped chunks wrapped in sliced prosciutto-like ham. One of my bites was a little under-cooked. The spaetzle (which was incorrectly spelled "spetzel" on the menu) was fried to the brown. Darker than fries, with none of the signature cheese and onions that make up such a dish. Its flavor was derived from the oil it was deep-fried in. Pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg: The fried egg was mixed by us, which my friend chop-sueyed into a beautiful yolky dish. I just returned from China where pig ear was on nearly every one of our dinner itineraries. These were much crunchier/crispier and more (again) deep-fried. The flavors also reminded me of...any Sichuan dishes growing up, only oiler. Marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions: Very uninspiring. I've had bone marrow to-die-for, and this was not only difficult to spoon out, but quite forgettable to the taste. The chimichurri and caramelized onions, on the other hand, were delicious. I simply wanted more toast for that. Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar: I was excited about this. I've never had poutine before. I had this. I don't really care for poutine anymore. It looked great if you were starving, but I'd trade a hot dog, chili cheese fries, and beef nachos for less than its $15 any day. Foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger: Yup. It was crazy meat stacked upon meat, a carnivoric dream. That said, it didn't do it for me. Esp not at $35 for the two bites I got. The foie gras was just like the one from the biscuit (earlier), and everything else was nothing special. My mind started to wander again, and I thought, "could totally get a great hamburger from Golden State across the street and be so much happier with my order, without spam or much ado." The dish just looked amazingly gluttonous. Yay for food porn, but I'd like it to taste just as worthwhile, too.   Tres leches, dulce de leche: In keeping with the theme, again - too much. So sweet, my teeth hurt. And I love sweets. I think Animal has something. A daring and nouveau concept based on heavily-prepared unconventional meat sided by flash-fried, butter-drunken carbs, an attraction and perhaps oddity in the city that is LA. But that's it. I don't think it warrants five - or fan four in my book. Give me a medium rare steak with some lobster mashed potatoes and creamed spinach, and I'll be a happy animal-eating gal.

Somewhere in between 3 and 4 stars. Pros: Some dishes lived up to the hype... The pig ear was a texture and flavor extravaganza! Crunchy with hints of tanginess from the lime - just get it and no they don't actually resemble ears at all. The pork belly sliders were out of this world! I did have an issue with spending $12 on two sliders. A full sized $6 burger is one thing, but a mini one - come on. But once I bit info the savory, slightly fatty (in a good way) slider I was in heaven. Again, just get it! Cons: The Foie Gras Loco Moco was just a mess, especially for like $35 bucks. Skip it and get some other appetizers instead. The poutine with fries and oxtail was ok, but lacking in the flavor department. Another skip, but at least the price was reasonable at around $12. Overall the services was great, some really innovative dishes, but also some big misses. I may go back and stick to the appetizers and wine section from now on.

Favorite Restaurant in LA. Foie Gras in maple gravy is to die for. Fried Rabbit legs, Crispy Pig Ear in  a Lemon Chili Aioli, were also great. Wasn't a big fan of the Bacon Chocolate Candy Bar, but I'm not a chocolate guy.The menu is different everyday based off of what's available at the farmer's market.  House cab goes well with everything. I've always sat at the bar because tables are never available unless you make reservations, but I really enjoy it. I always have a good time enjoying our food with the other bar mates. Service is Generally friendly too.

I was VERY excited to come here and try a lot of the delicious sounding items on their menu. Our combined orders consisted of: "radish, butter, salt" - why is this on their menu, better question: why did we order this? very straight forward, you get what you ordered. "crispy hominy, lime" - like corn nuts! "barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw" - very tasty but very heavy and filling. "melted petit basque, chorizo, garlic bread" - not bad, a good solid appetizer. "flat iron, asparagus, chanterelle, truffle parmesan fondue" - we ordered this medium rare and it was way way overcooked and dry. "foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger" - this was the best thing we ordered but spam makes it very salty and the hamburger was a dry piece of meat. It tasted better to just eat the foie gras by itself first. I was thoroughly stuffed and overall everything was not bad but no where near as spectacular as I fantasized in my mind before coming here. I might come back some time to try some other things but then again there are so many more restaurants out there waiting to be visited.

It's all about the OFFAL as we ultimately made our way to Animal.  Having heard all the fanfare and repeatedly making reservations NOT far enough in advance ... we were ecstatic to finally get our table on a busy Friday night. The spartan interior (bare walls with the exception of light bulbs on the side walls)  gives the vibe that it's all about the food and nothing else ... which is a welcome respite from the more pretentious restaurants within the area.  Personally I'm digging this space as it reminded me a lot of St. John's in London where there were few distractions ... just good food. We started with the bone marrow with chimichurri and carmelized onions, sweetbreads and creamed spinach, and the poutine with oxtail gravy. The bone marrow was excellent and it paired fantastically with the chimichurri sauce - definitely a MUST HAVE if you're a fan of the bone marrow.  The sweetbreads (which I recently have developed a taste for) was wonderful especially with the addition of some Meyer lemon - the combination is out of this world. The taste and silky texture of sweetbread is like no other.  For the uninitiated, do yourself a favor and try Animal's version - it's as good as it gets. The poutine with oxtail gravy was a bit disappointing as I found the gravy a bit brackish or salty though the fries were crunchy and cooked nicely. Ultimately - the dish somewhat failed in that the oxtail gravy was just a bit too much. The portions at Animal are not quite tapas as they're a little larger meant to be shared family style ... however, there are a few items that are large enough to be deemed an entree.  For that, we chose the foie gras loco moco - and let me tell you this ain't your typical Hawaiian Barbecue loco moco.  This divine dish consists of foie gras, spam, hamburger patty topped with a quail egg over a bed of rice.  Man this dish is insane!!!  Their  home made teriyaki sauce made with some maple and a hint of Sriracha sauce is off the freakin' hook!!!!  I would have this dish everyday of every week once I stop caring about the way I look or how high my cholesterol level can go - it's that freakin' good. For dessert ... we opted for the bacon chocolate crunch bar.  There has been much praise for this dessert, unfortunately, it fell a bit short.  I really do think that it's a nice concept, however I thought that it needed a bit more bacon ... perhaps I'm alone in this ... but when I read bacon chocolate on the menu I expect it to be 50 / 50. Overall, our dining experience was exceptional ... the service was great, the servers were attentive and friendly without being overbearing or annoying.  Plates and silverware were both replaced with each dish which I found to be a nice touch.  I was originally going to give this place a 4.5 stars (leading to a 4 star since I round down) ... but then I ask myself the question:  where else am I gonna get OFFAL this good in Southern California??? and Animal instantly became a five star restaurant.

The food here was excellent.   My friend and I started with the baby broccoli / pancetta / parmesan / soft egg / bread crumbs.  Two words: Order it. We also split an order of the pork belly sandwiches (2 in one order) which I could've easily eaten 5 of. Seriously, the pork belly was SOOOOO soft and the bbq sauce and slaw complemented the pork REALLY well. The bun was really soft too, which is key for any slider (koo koo roo, take note, cuz i may have broken my toof on your slider bun). We also ordered the poutine which were basically fries covered in cheddar cheese and oxtail gravy.  It was as heavy and as fattening as it sounds...but was damn good.  Would I order it again?  Maybe not but dont regret having tried it at least once. The decor and atmosphere at Animal were booooring,  but lucky for them, they've got the grub part downnnnnn.

I get so stoked even thinking about this place and I cannot wait to come back over and over and over again! We had: pork belly kimchi (weird combo but SO GOOD) foie gras with biscuit and gravy (OMG), quail fry (amazing) Tres leches, dulce de leche (dessert was the best thing in the world) Dude, even their bread was fantastic! I took a step back and really tried to think of a fault and couldn't think of a single thing. So in love...

Have no fear! Animal is here! Short on cholesterol? Need to gain a few pounds?   Didn't think Bacon could hit the dessert menu? Let me see, which app gets things started right? Sweetbreads?  Pork Belly?  A hip version of chili fries? 10 apps that defy the infamous LA diet... No slimming Caesar Salad without oil here!   No skinless poach chicken... We are talking extreme dining!!!   Get your man date on the line... its Animal time. Officer One:  Major - its Captain Eatwithoutconscience "reporting for duty" Officer Two:  Captain - eat your heart out... Officer One:  Is it on the menu?   I was thrilled to see the complete abandonment of all concern for my hearts future.... this place is a haven for all of us hard working, spin class taking, 80 hour a week working slaves that don't want to waste time ... its time to celebrate the meal... and do it with vigor! Dear Animal, You rocked my world. Love, Lipitor! PROS Cool place Tiny Kicking ass in the home of the kippah Not an open table all night Don't have a reservation - pray someone stroked out on the way there! Wine - very cool, very affordable wines - trust the lovely wine maiden Service - nailed it to the wall, skinned it, boned it and and fried it in a pan - great service. CONS Hard to get a reservation - I tried six times - finally got one. Loud - but I liked the energy. Fairfax - its a freaking circus - but it kind of fits like a glove No beef jerky on the menu, sorry dude. Seriously for a second - you only live once, make it enough. Animal! Animal! Animal!

First, be forewarned: a proper meal at Animal is the caloric equivalent of going to the fair and eating the deep fried everything offered there. Dieters, relinquish your reservations! 500+ reviewers have already talked about how fantastic the pork belly sliders are and how amazing the chocolate bacon crunch bar is (made with Valrhona chocolate, btw - be still, my heart!), and I'm going to have to agree: these are certainly two standouts. The highlight of my meal (aside from the sliders) was definitely the maple sausage gravy biscuit topped with foie gras. Is it a breakfast item? Is it a dinner item? Is it an in-between snack? The combination of flavors in this dish was very distinct and memorable; I enjoyed seeing the foie gras used in this way. Other items we tried: - grilled octopus with chorizo: the octopus was fresh and tender, while the spicy chorizo made a great compliment. - bone marrow: this was delicious, but the chimichirri sauce on top was a bit overpowering. - pig ear with chili lime sauce and fried egg: pork, chili, lime, egg, oil...how could this possibly not be an amazing dish? - heirloom melon salad: light and refreshing, we needed this as a palate cleanser because of all the carnage that we consumed that night (count em: five pork dishes, plus one beef!). Can't get a reservation? Show up early (6pm) and get a seat at the bar. They serve a full menu there, and you can chat with the friendly and knowledgeable staff for their recommendations. There's even a little window into the kitchen, where you can catch glimpses of the hard working kitchen staff slaving over a hot stove to get you your carnal culinary indulgences.

Love the appetizers! I actually love their smoked pork belly and the spare ribs.  The foie gras is also a big plus.  You won't normally find this dish as an appetizer. So this is definitely a treat! This place is pretty small so if you guys are coming as a group call for reservation. I don't recommend street parking because you'll end up spending a lot of time driving around. Just do valet. I hope u like my review.

My husband and I will be hitting this place every time we make the drive to LA - it was THAT good!  We dined there 6 weeks ago, so excuse my made up names for all the dishes! *Foie Gras on a biscuit with gravy. The husband and I hate gravy so were pretty nervous about this one. We are huge foie gras fans and this was probably the best foie I've had in my entire life. It sounds gross but by all means try it! *Rabbit loin. What a cool flavor! One of the most interesting meats I've had in a long time. Tender, delish. *Fried quail. OMG how do I get a bucket of these things? Like the most perfectly fried chicken you've ever tasted - but better. *Pork belly sliders. Pretty damn underwhelmed with this. It was gross, messy, and honestly some of the worst pork belly I've ever tasted. I love pork belly but this was chewy and gross - not tender and succulent. *Tres leches - we didn't want to end the amazing meal on a sad note (after the gross pork belly sliders), so we had some amazing tres leches ! Highly recommend it.

This restaurant wants to make you think, fat and happy. The portions are small enough that you can sample a variety and thus get a better sense of what's the big idea. Each dish offers some variation of the lines: "Wait! Don't throw that part away! That's the best part! Look, taste, see?! I know, it's awesome, right?" The whole menu appears to make use of familiar combinations -hot spice, tangy sweet, savory crunch and rich gravy - to make smooth introductions of now strange cuts: brains, ears, bone marrow, liver, hearts.   We had a fantastic meal of pig ears turned into spicy chips alongside a just right kale salad, followed by a meaty, lightly charred octopus and a baked marrow dressed to the nines in a green chimichurri. The beer suggestion was right on as was a slightly effervescent wine (like a child's dream of wine.) Each dish had us ready for more - until what turned out to be our dessert: the seared foie gras on a biscuit with gravy and syrup. Please consider ordering this dish only if there are four of you. If you're on a date, order it only if you want to venture into Sid and Nancy territory.

Instead of rewriting the review on the food, just read Rob C's review on it. It is dead on. I had high hopes for this place. The food was mediocre and did not justfy the snobbiness. We were running late and decided to give them a courtesy call and which they told us to hurry because they may just give our table away. When we got there, the place was empty! there were two occupied tables. Even an hour after we sat down to eat, the place was more than half empty.  The whole urgency about giving away our table was so uncalled for. Our waitress had total mood swings. She never told us that we had to order all at once and when attempting to add more to the order, she gave us attitude about it saying that the chef likes to tend to one order all at once. WELL if we had know that order 10 dishes wasn't going to be enough because the portions were smaller than expected, we would have ordered more up front. on a good note, I don't drink enough water but the salt content in this food made me drink 3x my daily content of water ( having to pee 10 times throughout the night was no fun though).

I'm a food server. Having said that... It's good food, for sure. Fattening, laden with butter, richer-than-Trump rich. Okay. But if I'm going to be served the main course at 10:55 pm on a Sunday evening, 5 minutes before they close the kitchen, I ought to be able to have a glass of wine with said course. Willing to pay the $14 for an average glass of wine, I was denied. Huh?? "We already called 'last call,'" I was told, without so much as an apology or even consideration. Yeah, last call for food, I'd been told. I can't have a glass of wine with it? It's not like it's 2AM and the drinks legally have got to be picked up, right? An unfathomable and rookie service mistake. And a deal breaker at these prices. If you can put the food down minutes before closing, you can put a glass of wine down with it. Animal, you're crazy popular--now. Don't believe your own hype and start forgoing proper service. There are too many great restaurants in this town for get-em-out crap like that. Adios.

Animal was everything the other Yelpers said it was and more.  Exotic, interesting, scary, and most of all, delicious.   We had five dishes and split a dish for dessert - my wife was very full, but I thought this was the perfect amount.  We tried the following: Marrow Bone - very good - creamy marrow that you scoop straight outta tha bone (thug style)!  A little salty, but they give you  texas-toast to spread it on. Veal Brains - amazing, the brain was lightly fried and was set on top of a curry apple sauce - possibly one of my favorites.  Kind of like fried soft tofu. Pig Ear - strips of fried pig ear with a biting lime ceviche-style sauce.  This was the one dish I didn't care for, but my wife liked it. Pork Sliders - the most innocuous dish of the night, but also the best.  Perfectly flavored, they just melted in my mouth. Fois Gras with biscuit, maple bacon grave - also delish, very creamy, and the biscuit and grave added a nice balance.   Bacon-Chocolate crunch bars - a little underwhelming, not bad, just nothing special.  I will skip it next time.  The chocolate was high quality, but it overpowered the other flavors of the bar. Overall, I would highly recommend this place to any adventurous eater.  My only complaint is that the dishes were all a bit salty, but nothing extreme.  A decent beer selection, even Damnation from the epic Russian River Brewing company.

One evening before I moved from LA, my friend and I decided it was about time we tried Animal. We arrived with no reservation (tip: It's better when you make a reservation!) but we waited for about 25 minutes that night and dammit, I am SO glad we did! First to the bummers: I was disappointed that they were out of the poutine. But this only makes me want to come back again because I follow this mantra when it comes to food "If it is sold out, it must be good.*" - *I know this isn't always true but I find 7 times out of 10 it is. It is a bit on the pricey side but I figured screw it. I was moving from LA, why not splurge a bit? Now onto the goodness! What I demand that you order when you attend: Melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread - Yes, god a thousand times yes. It is salty and cheesy and gooey and yummy. I seriously debated about licking the skillet clean and dealing with the 2nd degree burns. Barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw - Melt in your mouth sweet meat that is so good... soft warm rolls, crunchy cold slaw, absolutely satisfying! The portion is only for 2 but I was seriously debating about ordering 2 more plates to eat there and then 2 more for home. I also ordered the special salad of the night and the chocolate crunch bacon bar, which was rather tasty. I enjoyed the vanilla sauce that was served with it too. Some might not be so big on it but I dug it since yea, I like bacon. I like chocolate and thought "bring me more bacon for my chocolate!" I do enjoy that the menu changes daily since foods grow in seasons, y'all. I know in CA we are spoiled and enjoy pretty much every fruit/vegetable imaginable whenever we want but there is reason foods taste better during certain times of the year. I would go back to Animal again and I recommend you take friends! Share the plates! That way you can try as much of the menu as you can!

My friends and I get together every week for Deep Fried Tuesdays (http://www.deepfriedtues…) where someone hosts and cooks a (usually) rich meal. This week no one felt like cooking or hosting, so we went out to Animal, a restaurant after our own hearts -- high on the meat, low on the restraint. The restaurant, located across from the now-abandoned Largo is a totally minimalist and clean wooden box. Light bulbs Thomas Edison probably had in his house illuminate the scorched wooden tables in the long dining room. Animal also fits into what my bf calls LA's "Culture of Loud" -- it's a little hard to hear people sitting directly in front of you. It's totally forgivable here because there's an old school Muppets metal lunch box nestled among the wine bottles with, you guessed it, Animal. Yahh yahh yahhH!! Our water, personable and cute, introduced himself to us (I've got an awful memory, so I can't remember his name -- but he was cute). Waiter-guy immediately turned on the up-sell and we were not pushing back. Every item on the evening's menu sounded delicious and he gave us his recommendations and hinted that the portion sizes are on the small side, so it would be a good idea to order a starter and an entree. That totally wasn't true, the entrees were enormous -- as were most of the starters. Still, he took very good care of us and didn't freak out when we told him we'd need some extra time sopping up the sauces remaining on the seemingly "finished" plates. Four of us spent the evening sharing every dish. We started with two appetizers; foie gras on a honey biscuit and pork belly with kimchi and peanuts. The seared foie gras was sweet and plump, resting on top of a fluffy biscuit. The rich sweetness of the first dish was in complete contrast to the earthy-sour flavors of the pork belly. The blending of the peanuts and kimchi with the pork belly balanced very well and the pork was not overpowered at all. The next two dishes were the Heirloom tomatoes, feta, pickled onions and spareribs with a balsamic sauce, tomatoes and bread salad. The salad was chock-full of kalamata olives, goat cheese and tender pickled onions coating an array of quartered and halved heirloom tomatoes. Green, yellow, and red, this is something I want again on a hot summer night. The pork ribs, liberally coated in a balsamic sauce, were apparently cooked for about, oh, 4 months. The meat fell clean off the bone! Mmm, good thing there was a side of tomatoes and homemade croutons. I think some of the flavors from the rib sauce infused the bread, giving it one of those elusive Japanese flavors. Because I'm a fan of Rosie Perez and Jeopardy, ("What is quail?"), I ordered the quail fry; fried quail served on a bed of grits and greens with a slab of bacon on the side. Oh yeah, and a thick, heavy layer of butterscotch flavored chicken fat/stock reduction coated the entire plate. After we finished off the teeny quails, repeatedly dragging them through the sauce like they were paintbrushes, we had the waiter leave the dish on the table so we could continue dipping (our fingers) into the chicken lake. This is the part of the evening when I knew we ordered too much. Darn you affable waiter! Oh, but I really don't mean it. My wimpy stomach sometimes tries to tell my brain stuff like "oh, but I'm so full" to which my brain goes, "shut up! EAT!" Our last two dishes were the heaviest, meat-wise; Salty pork chops with broccoli, red peppers, and tiny onions. The final dish was Niman flatiron steak served with sweet breads, fresh corn and potatoes. By now I was for sure force-feeding myself, but the pork chops once again had the rich saltiness I can't resists, especially the parts nearest the bones. The steak, nicely cooked, was another fine example of how well the kitchen dresses up your average "meat" dish. Accessorized with sweetbreads, this steak was decked out for a night at the opera.

"Animal" I wanted to come here when I heard the name of it. It's sounds so savage. People say that San Francisco, New York, Chicago are the food Mecca's of America, but I have to say that LA has them all beat. You can tell that the owners love food. The place has a clean and simple design, the food is the focus. For a moment you may forget that you are in LA and Hollywood glam. The Sliders were amazing and succulent. The foie gras was a bit too rich for my blood, but very good as well. I loved the greens on the menu as well with bits of bacon. Desserts were amazing too! When you're in LA, you have to check out Animal, understated decor, with the focus on the food and wine. You can't go wrong here.  This is a foodie's heaven.  One of my go to places in LA. Animal, I love you.

The food is exceptionally good. I think its interesting how the menu is made up of heavy items that, when combined, doesn't taste particularly heavy. Between 3 of us, we had 3 appetizers and 2 entrees, which is what they recommend. The Foie Gras dishes were by far my favorite, but everything was great. App 1: foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - I would have never known that this would be so amazing. I could probably have eaten 3 of these myself. App 2: pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg - Never had pig ear before, but it was very good. The flavors remind me of thai food, but the ear had a fun crunchy texture. App 3: poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - These were French fries with a little something different, oxtail gravy. I liked it when the poutine was soggy from the gravy. Entree 1: flat iron, sunchoke hash, truffle parmesan fondue - This was pretty good, but don't think it was out of this world. Entree 2: foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger - My favorite dish here. I love foie gras, quail egg, spam, burger beef and even loco and moco. Very well done. Dessert: bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise - Very interesting take on dessert with an awesome texture taken from the crunch bar. Much better than the chocolate covered bacon I had at the LA county fair. Wine: the only Tannat available. It was delicious. But I don't think its available anymore. Service was spectacular. On a random Monday night, however, I had trouble getting a reservation. Even though I got one, the place wasn't very packed. I assume walk-ins are encouraged.

The expectation is set the minute you walk in the door and Pig has to be one of my favorite "Animals" to eat.  Sorry veggies, the food chain is in full effect for these two food dudes new restaurant.   I went with a group of six people so we were able to try many of the menu items.  While there will be some carry overs, this menu changes on seasonality and availability of top notch ingredients.  What a novel idea! What we had... Apps - Melted Petite Basque with caramelized onions and chorizo - fuck was it good.  Simple but perfectly executed - Shaved asparagus with Bacon vinaigrette and poached egg - solid but seemed a little sloppy with the runny egg.  Maybe they could add some crunchy texture. - Pork ribs, these literally fall off the bone and have a sweet suculent sauce oh and as an added benefit they were accompanied by a tasty cruton salad - Clams, the fennel sausage sauce was killer, we even ordered more bread to slop it up. Mains - The 109 Tomahawk rib-eye chop - could be one of my new favorite steaks in town. the foie gras sauce was a near perfect compliment. - Niman Pork Chop, other than it being raw when it was delivered, the second showing was a textural medley of smokey, sweet and spicy goodness with an amazing crust and tender meat.  Other than a smoked pork chop that I had at a BBQ joint in Texas this is my new favorite.  Oh and it is served with a side of these amazing pieces of thick cut niman bacon, my eye nearly popped out of my head. - Bronzino with capers and brown butter sauce, flawless execution including the deboning at the table.  If you have never had Bronzino you must try this delicious white fish! Halibut - not as memorable as the other dishes, but perfectly cooked and nice flavor profile. Desert - Blueberry tart was simply perfect... sweet, tart, gooey, crunchy, delicious. - Chocolate and Bacon - I so wanted this to work as I have been reading about chocolate covered bacon and unfortunately it fell a little flat.  The chocolate (fudge?) was tasty but the bacon crumbles were thrown on as an afterthought and shockingly had minimal flavor. Overall this restaurant is must try, but here are a few words of warning and part of the reason I didn't give it a full five stars... The noise level is as other people mention, deafening!  Not easy for conversation.  And while I enjoy the minimal decor with concrete floors, they have created an unintentional noise animal.  To note, I did speak with the hostess on the way out and she said that they are installing sound baffling on Monday.  If this happens this will be if it is already one of the hottest new restaurants in town!  Also keep in mind they have a great selection of beer and wine but don't sell liquor yet. $20 corkage fee!

star (+/-) unique dishes/presentation/well-prepared. Ordered: chicken liver toast, flat iron sunchoke hash..., poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar & bacon choco dessert. but lack of greens...hmm...name change to cholesterol city? star (+) paired well w/wines recommended by helpful, courteous staff. star (-/+) minimalist streamline decor is kinda too blah for me yet dimmed lighting still romantic enough for the over-zealous Pre-VDate couples that Thurs eve. Almost missed the front b/c of no name, sign, indication what the place is until we were seated. Random find after our stumble from seriously funny Bang Studios, few doors down. To the other side & yet to try: Canters Deli. star (-) pricing. esp.on the choco.bacon $7 for 2itty-bitty strips?! yum but not great. star (-) according to server & chefs, certain items couldn't be 'modified' hence no salt/pepper/side of green onions, etc. can be added even for a nominal fee. Extra bread & Tabasco hot sauce was a slight exception but must be requested w/dire sincerity. *note: all non-punctuation in my review reflect/mirror the look of their menu. otherwise, i'm usually not that lazy to hit the shift button.

Well I would have given them 5 stars if I didn't have Heart Burn all night, the food is reallllllly heavy! I would definitely recommend this place to go have a glass of wine and one, or two dishes max! We made the mistake of sharing 4 dishes (2 of us) and I almost stopped by Ceders Sinea Hospital to make sure I don't die in my sleep...... "The Poutine" Excellent, Really good! The Oxtail was tender, and the fries+Gravy were buttertastic. "The Fried Quail" To die for, lightly breaded, perfectly fried, my fav dish.... "The marrow bone" Delish, came with a heavily buttered brushette and some really yummy relish "The pig tail" It was ayt, pretty heavy dish, especially since they drown it in buffalo and ranch sauce. The check should come with a blank prescription for Zantac 75......

I don't think there's much more I can add to reiterate the fact that the food at Animal is fantastically good. Myself along with a few friends came for dinner to celebrate my birthday, and it turned out to be a great culinary experience. Personally, I wholeheartedly enjoyed the amberjack, which was incredibly fresh and perfectly seasoned, similar to that of ceviche. This was in fact my favorite dish overall. Another standout was the chicken liver toast- starkly simple yet rich and immensely flavorful with the addition of caramelized onion. I could have had two pieces alone. The duck confit was another favorite amongst the crowd, along with the pig ear which was surprisingly spicy, but in a good way. For someone who's not a big fan of gnocchi, I was sold with Animal's version which was less heavy than that I've tried in the past. The pomodoro sauce was zesty and a great accompaniment. Probably had something to do with the freshness of the gnocchi as well. I was pretty disappointed by the foie gras as the maple sausage gravy was too overpowering and sweet, and didn't really help to bring out the best of the foie gras. The "biscuit" which is also a part of the dish detracted from the taste of the foie as it had absorbed the sauce and became an all around mushy mess in my mouth. I think the foie gras could stand to exist alone, and I would have been happier. Another issue that arose was that we weren't fully aware of the family/tapas style dining, which created a bit of confusion and discomfort as not everyone in the party knew one another enough to want to share so intimately. It became difficult to divvy up the portions as some of the plates are smaller than others. So if one person particularly liked something, they only had one opportunity to sample it. I quickly learned that 8 diners in a party here was not the best idea. (I should accurately note that they do serve a few 'entrees' although not many.) Overall though, the food was indeed solid and again a great culinary experience. I'm sure that my next visit will fare to be more successful, as I'll go with a much smaller party. As in, one other person. Actually I'd say that four max is good, in fact perfect because you can still order a bunch of different dishes and have the right amount of portions to share. And if you're as indecisive as myself, you'll want a few extra people to justify ordering half of the menu.

I wanted to love this place...I really did. It had a cool vibe, nice staff, interesting menu.... But everything felt just a bit too much - Pork ribs. Flat iron. Veal. Quail. Kale. Everything sounded simple, clean....but then it comes to you and it's like here's your ribs...DOUSED IN A BOTTLE OF BALSAMIC. here's your delicious flat iron....DROWNING IN A TRUFFLED CREAM SAUCE. Maybe I didn't order right but I wanted to feel the soul and simplicity of the food and I felt the food got lost in the hopes of trying to be interesting. There was a lack of balance...I will give kudos to the veggie dishes though. Oddly enough. But those were straightforward and good - plop a perfect soft egg on my baby broccoli or mix in just the right amount of citrus & cheese with the kale and I was a happy camper. And yup, I went for the bacon chocolate bar. Wasn't digging it. Couldn't even taste the bacon. We all ended up eating around the bacon and just digging around for the chocolate and nuts. Plus the $$$ I had to give up for this meal...sorry. Not worth it.

Animal did not disappoint for a hedonistic, meaty birthday dinner! The menu is constructed of both small plates and entrees, but mostly small plates.  It's wonderful for a dabbler like myself who prefers to try as many dishes as I can.  Even better, the small plates are hardly small.  They could easily sustain the appetite of a young female without problem. We ordered and loved, each of the following: KALE salad with julienne figs, pears, pecorino cheese, and a lemony dressing.  Kale is a sturdy leaf so as a salad, there was a good amount of crunch and heft, even when done up in a chiffonade.   DUCK CONFIT had the most perfect crispy skin though maybe...maybe the meat was tiny bit dry?  This came with an argula salad that was also expertly dressed. BBQ PORK BELLY SLIDER SANDWICHES were soo indulgent.  They don't skimp on the pork belly.  Each slider had two solid cubic chunks, some more fatty, some more meaty but all tasty.  The sauce was sweet but not overly so, as some reviewers complained.  The slaw added crunch.  This was hard to eat as a burger so I deconstructed it so that I could maneuver this dish with a knife & fork. If that weren't enough, we ordered the FOIE GRAS LOCO MOCO consisting of a solid slab of foie gras, draped over spam, then a hamburger patty, over white rice in a puddle of sweet soy sauce and dabs of siracha.  This was excellent!  At times, it was overwhelmingly meat and saucy but undeniably tasty. Somewhere during entrees, I asked the waiter if he'd light a birthday candle on the side of the BACON CHOCOLATE BAR for my date's dessert.  I was secretly hoping they'd comp the dessert but alas, the candle was there but so was the dessert on the bill.  No problem, the world is full of liars and I could have easily been one of them.  The dessert was much like a very good chocolate, hazelnut bar accented by fleur de sal or any other salty component.  It was only if you got a large portion of the bacon crispies on top would you KNOW that you were eating a bacon dessert.  My date thought this was overly hyped but I thought it was actually a fairly subtle and smart dish. It is not at all necessary to eat like a stupid carnivorous glutton at Animal but it is easy to do so.  In the future, I may try to balance the protein with more vegetable dishes and order fewer dishes in total. Seriously, what a great lil place!

Animal is a solid 4 stars in my book, no rounding up here.  Before going into the food, I thought the service was excellent.  The staffs were knowledgeable and attentive.  I thought it was a very comfortable experience dining at Animal, and the service definitely added to that experience. The dishes at Animal are all very creative.  Maybe too creative if you're not into trying out new or more exotic foods.  Now its actually not that exotic...if you've visited any number of the more authentic asian restaurants in LA, they can be a lot more "creative" in using exotic ingredients =P.   The portions weren't that big.  We ordered 5 dishes and a dessert for just the 2 of us, plus 2 x 1/2 bottles and the total still only came out to less than 200 bucks.  Definitely try the sweetbreads if it's available on the menu, and if you're feeling adventurous.  Ironically, our least favorite dish had the most "animals" in it , the foei gras loco moco w/ fried quail egg, spam and hamburger.  Other dishes we had were good though; the purslane salad, bone marrow (not as good as Pizzeria Mozza's) and hamachi salad.  Will definitely come back. =)

Okay, listen.  I am new to this neighborhood and I have low self-esteem.  If Animal had a sign out front saying "Animal," I didn't see it and had to think twice about going in.  The restaurant is decorated in that minimalist style that the kids love so much nowadays, making me feel even more out of place in my teal Alf sweatshirt and tapered, pleated acid-wash jeans.  The people sitting at the other tables all looked like they made a lot more money than me and wouldn't be fun to talk to.   All that said, keep your eyes on the table and on the kind server and you will have an enjoyable evening. I've cooked from the Two Dudes, One Pan cookbook and have never been disappointed.  The meat dishes that came out of my kitchen were unctuous, laden with umami, and made my house smell like I knew what I was doing.  Here at the restaurant, in the hands of cooks who actually do know what they're doing, the food is sublime.  Heirloom tomato salad, fried hominy, chorizo, pork belly, spare ribs.  Sparkling ale.  Holy Jesus.  Delicious.

7th Pit stop in the food race around LA.  Could have skipped although I only sampled the Crispy Chocolate Bacon Bar which was featured on the Food Network.  Rating would should be higher as other members of the group absolutely LOVED the Loco Moco dish...but at $35 a plate, I think it is mandatory you love it!  I tasted the bone marrow and man that was good.  Very garlicky and creamy.   Service:  Hmmm let's see, since we didn't have reservations on a Saturday night the hostess started off a little cold towards us...but slowly warmed up as we weren't in a hurry and didn't mind waiting.  We were seated at the bar and later I overheard bar manager ask our server why we were sitting there if we were only ordering a dessert and beer.  Felt very uncomfortable after that.  Minus 2 stars for that.

Complaint: I couldn't see myself in any of the bathroom mirrors.  Short people DO exist, you know? Everything else was great.   We started off with the basque and chorizo.  It was delicious.  But i mean, who doesn't love melted cheese over chorizo?  It burned the roof of my mouth though, so be careful.  Don't be an eager little piggy like yours truly.   I decided on the quail fry for my main course (I'm starting to notice a fried bird theme in a lot of my food reviews).  At first I was a bit skeptical ... I don't really like sweet foods and this quail was served with a maple jus.  Much to my surprise, the hint of sweetness paired really nicely with the grits, chard and fatty slab of bacon. Mike had the flat iron.  Loved it.  The meat was juicy and the truffle sauce addicting.  Meat and potatoes done right! For dessert ... The bacon chocolate bar.  I wish it had just bacon.  This was my least favorite dish.   We got there around 6pm on a Friday evening.  It didn't get crowded until 6:45/7:00.  If you don't plan on getting there right when they open, you should probably make reservations.   Enjoy!

Dining Date: 3/24/10 I cannot tell you how excited I am about a restaurant that celebrates the carnivore in me. The restaurant is actually pretty stark decor wise.  The food is totally center stage here.  We order roughly a dozen dishes for six people and share everything.  The chicken liver toast ($3) is the first to come.  We have two orders and cut each toast into thirds.  The tender livers have been spread out on toast with a balsamic vinaigrette sauce and chives. The baby kale, pecorino, lemon, smashed crouton ($9) salad is light and refreshing.  I expect it to be bitter but the lemon and pecorino balance the dish nicely. The pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg ($11) plate arrives to oohs and aahs from my table!  The crunchy pig ear slivers are delicious and the sunny side up egg sops up the salty pig bits. The blood orange, chili oil, castlevetrano, red onion ($8) is a great palate cleanser.  We ask the waiter what castlevetrano is.  Olives he says.  I don't see or taste any olives but the blood oranges are so juicy and sweet.  This would be easier to share had we ordered a second one. The duck confit, apple, pecans, dates, arugula ($14) is perfect.  The skin is so thin and crispy.  It's the best one I've tasted and I've been disappointed by duck at lots of nice restaurants.  You want the skin to be crispy not hard. The rabbit loin, butternut squash, apple, bacon, cipollini ($12) is the best rabbit ever.  I've never had rabbit before but this one is so moist, like a delicate chicken.  It reminds me of how delicate veal is compared to beef in both taste and texture.  I get two perfect bites. The foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy ($22) is such a generous portion.  It demands to be shared.  My mouth waters when the warm aroma wafts across the table.  The biscuit underneath is moist, fluffy and sweet.  The biscuit and maple sausage gravy alone would have southerners coming to LA in droves.  But the star is still the foie gras. The sweetbreads, creamed spinach, capers, hen of the woods mushrooms ($14) comes next.  Serve this to someone who has never had sweetbreads before and they will tell you that they love sweetbreads.  I have never had sweetbreads before, I must love sweetbreads.  This is exactly how I wanted my first time to be.  The sweetbreads have a light crisp exterior and soft, almost creamy interior.  There's no icky, spongy texture or snarly offal aroma that would be off-putting for the faint of heart. The roasted marrow bone, caramelized shallot, chimmichurri, toast ($8) arrives next.  This also elicits oohs and aahs.  The first time I had this was at Bottlerock but I like the one at Animal better. We have three orders of barbeque pork belly sandwiches ($11).  At two per order, everyone gets their own.  I would have been happy splitting one in half.  The pork belly is delicious and the bun is warm and soft.  But I find the slaw and sauce a bit sweet.  This is also the point where I am beginning to feel full. The poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar ($15) scares me a bit when it arrives.  I forgot to bring Lactaids to dinner and I'm wondering how much dairy I've had thus far.  I am pleased that the oxtail gravy is more predominant than the cheese. The one entree that we orders finally arrives, the rib eye for two, escargot butter, mash, greens (market price).  This is at least $85 worth of ribeye.  It really is Flintstone sized.  It stands almost four inches tall.  It's medium rare with a beautiful sear, tasty even without the escargot butter.  There are whole snails dotted through out the butter sauce. The mashed potatoes are very creamy, perfect accompaniment for the steak.  The other side for the rib eye is the greens.  I'm actually craving the kale salad again at this point.  The rib eye and escargot butter is rich and filling.  The lemon in the kale salad would just help to balance all those flavors out. Someone has the courage to order dessert.  The tres leches, dulche de leche ($7) is the best tres leches cake I have tasted.  Most of the time I just want to spit them out, the milk always reminds me of baby throwup.  But this one has a nice frosting and lovely pool of caramel sauce.  I can literally only manage one bite though. I did share a bottle of house Cabernet ($20) with W and M.  My only complaint is that the server only poured me a half glass and that was it.  W got at least a full glass and M had a solid two glasses.  Even with sparing sips, I wasn't able to stretch it very far. I had two firsts tonight, rabbit and sweetbreads and they were both wonderful.  In one meal, I have consumed an assortment of creatures: chicken, beef, pig, rabbit, duck, goose, snails.  I think the tab for six came out to over $400 including tax and tip, R settled the bill for our group.  Food made up about $313.  My part in all this cost $60.79.

This place represents the potential of inventive and fun continental americana cuisine. The yelp rating scale says it all: As good as it gets! Shook and Dotolo are true artisans and the simplicity and balance of their dishes proves this. The no frills, but lively atmosphere at the restaurant, allows the patron to focus on the food without being inundated with some faux-trendy ambience. We ordered half the menu and shared everything (a party of four that turned into six) and wish we had room for the other half. Next time I'm in L.A., I'm there to take care of that. The service was great, the food is unreal, and this is a must try. Oh...and if you need someone to tell you if a restaurant is kid friendly or not, then you are an idiot. (Although I'd take my kid here if I had one.)

I had been meaning to try this for awhile under my friend's recommendation. The place was delicious. I was a bit intimidated by the fact that most of the menu had pork and I don't eat pork, however everything I had that didn't have pork was amazing. We had the poutine with oxtail gravy, hamachi tostada, flat iron steak, the fois gras loco moco, and the thai quail along with 3 out of the 4 desserts they had. The place did not disappoint and everything was extremely flavorful. The service was great, the ambiance was obviously hipsterish, but overall a fun outing. I definitely hope to go again soon.

If you are a Foodie this is the place to go. I have been dying to go to this place for months and finally the time has arrived. I came here for my B-day, but i knew that everyone in my party wasn't a foodie like me and i gave them all warning to look at the menu and if they didn't want to come i would not be hurt. They don't take reservations over 8 people, so i was trying to get people to drop out, so my dad didn't come but my mom, wife, brothers, there girlfriend and some close friends came. I didn't know that one of the girlfriends called ahead to see if they had anything "normal" on the menu. They informed her that they had ricotta ravioli on the menu. (will explain the outcome of this in a minute) here is what we ordered: Burrata, raymundo's tomatillo salsa, the cheese was great, but we felt we needed to order toast to spread on it so we got an order of chicken liver toast which paired well with this Marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions - this came with bread and it was a great spread on the bread. You really don't taste the marrow because the chimichurri just blasted it way through your taste buds, so the marrow gives it its substance and the flavor comes from the chimichurri and bread BBQ pork belly sandwiches, slaw - the meat was so flavorful we had to order two Quail Fry, grits, chard, slab bacon, maple jus - the grits were cooked right and the quail tasted fine, nothing special, but it was good Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - this sits on top of frys,.i'm at lost for words on this dish, this was so good, we shared the dish we others and i cried a little inside everytime some grabbed a fry Flat iron artichoke hash, truffle parmesan fondue - two people got this and they had to share that was the role and this was they best topping on any steak every. The steak was cooked perfectly and did i mention the truffle parmesan fondue topping that will keep me coming back over and over again Foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger - Of course i had loco moco before this is Hawaiian dish, but never like this, the meal was over rice with hamburger, spam, foie gras gravy and then the quail egg. I have to say i couldn't share this dish with anyone but my wife, but she was only aloud a small piece For dessert we ordered tres leches, dulce de leche best ever Bacon Chocolate crunch bar - i love the salty bacon mixing in with the chocolate, the center is the crunch not the bacon. the center reminded me a kit kat And the pie of the day was apple pie and it tasted like apple pie with homemade whip cream I can't wait until i come back and make sure if you come here with a group...SHARE

A little expensive for what you get but a good experience. Truly gracious and attentive service. Impressive. We tried a ton of items, most were pretty good. Some knocked it out of the park. My favorites: 1)pork belly sliders - just amazing. 2) poutine - like carne asada fries but probably 4x as expensive and with gravy, really good snack type food. 3) loco moco - I didn't know spam could taste this good. 4) foie gras, biscuit, gravy - Would be number one but the gravy was too sweet for me. 5) Grilled octopus - this really impressed me, cooked perfectly. 6) rabbit loin - really juicy rabbit, would be higher but the sauce threw me off a bit. I did not care for the chicken liver toast, the flat iron steak was not that good especially because it was overpowered by the truffle fondue on it. Deserts were not worth ordering. Bottom line: good meat-centric meal that is novel, rich, filling and expensive.

No vegetarians allowed!!! Pescatarians maybe, but you'd still be looked down upon. If you come here, be ready to eat some meat. The place is a carnivores wet dream. That being said, it's still for the adventurous eater. If you just want a plain old steak or a simple pork chop, this isn't the spot--go to Boa, Morton's or Ruth Chris. This is gourmet meat with a upscale take. --Bone marrow topped with a pesto sauce spread on Texas toast=touchdown --Rabbit wrapped in a think Euro ham (almost like Prosciutto)=slam dunk --fancy tuna (forgot name) tosrada, spruced with cabbage, onions, onion rings and an assortment of fresh veggies=swish, nothing but net --$12 glass of Majoli rose= foul tip (not the best), especially for the price --chicken liver topped with a shallots in a balsamic reduction sauce=HOME--fucking--RUN....best thing I've ever tasted.

Hmmmm. Sorry, but this is how I feel about their food after having dinner there last night, and in all fairness, I'd give their foods a 2.5 if that were an option. First of all, let me just say, I believed the hype and I was SOOOO excited about trying this place.  Been on top of my To-Eat list for a long time (maybe why I was disappointed...?)  I really enjoyed the coziness and ambiance of the restaurant and I found their foods to be perfectly portioned so it gives you the opportunity to try multiple dishes.  Plus, the service was great, and I was bursting with excitement as I sat there sipping my wine and waiting for my food to arrive. First dish that came was the "melted petit basque, chorizo w/ grilled bread".  I thought the dish was decent and had just the right amount of flavor.  Then came the "smoked trout salad, corn vinaigrette, benton's bacon, crema", which I thought was a decent starter salad and it was plated beautifully.  Both starters were decent, nothing mind blowing. Then came the "veal tongue, smoked foie gras, pastrami spices & crab apple".  The smoked foie gras was amaaazing.  Best thing I tried all night.  It was basically a delicious blob made from foie gras + cream cheese.  I licked it clean.  But that was only a small dab on the side and the veal plus everything else on the plate was mediocre to me.   Next came the "marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions" - which was really good.  The "foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy" was really disappointing to me.  As an experienced consumer of foods that most people find gross, I loveee indulging in wonderfully strange foods in this world like tongue, ears, liver, heart, blood, gizzards, pigs feet, etc. from all around the world.  I was so excited about this place because that's what they specialize in and they have raving reviews.  The foie gras was not the best I've had in memory and the biscut + maple sausage gravy was wayyyy too flavorful.  And by too flavorful, I mean overly salty and sweet, and oily...and not in a good way.  Last came the "bbq pork belly sandwiches w/ slaw" and I thought the slaw was overly creamy.  Pork belly was overly oily.  By the end of the meal I felt so disgusted because everything was just way too oily and heavy for me. As a destination restaurant that is so highly praised, I just can't help but feel disappointed.  To me, the flavors were over the top and not in a good way.  It just didn't...mesh.  But hey, there are hundreds of other people that disagree with me so \(°_o)/

t was fine. And yes, that is a four-letter word. Overpriced. Not much of an ambiance. I wasn't really that impressed with the bacon chocolate bar, and I really wanted to be! Everything seemed a little off. Would of been OK if we didn't feel sick the next day.

Everything at Animal is rich and heavy.  That can be delicious but also a little monotomous in flavor profile. Based on comments here we were intrigued by worried about how good the poutine would be.  It was heavy on the oxtails, which made it more of an oxtail dish than a traditional poutine, which was fine by me.  One of the two highlights of the night. The sweetbreads were also outstanding, light and crispy. The pork eaters in the crew loved the little pork sliders (ssam bar-ish). Surprisingly the table was less into the two foie gras dishes (the loco moco included). The ribeye for two was enormous and fine but not special.  I will stick to trying the flatiron next time. Service was friendly.  All dishes were served family style and came out in any order, as we were warned.  Fine.  But if you are going to operate that way due to kitchen limitations - please bring serving utensils with each dish.... We detected no attitude that some other yelpers have encountered.  Come with an empty stomach and a fat wallet.

Other than the rocks in our stomachs that we still have from eating so much meaty meatiness, Animal was quite the pleasant - if porky (literally) - experience.  This is one of those places whose decor is what we'd call casual chic....stark, clean lines with patina'd wood tables to add a little friendliness and warmth.   So what's the shtick here?  Well, the place is aptly named...lots of meat (especially pork) to be had.  We're talking big, thick slabs of bacon, rich pork bellies that dissolve on contact...tasty.  It's classic comfort food remixed with fascinating twists and high quality ingredients. Anyways, as with so many new hip eateries, you can choose to do traditional entrees or go tapas style.  We did a little of both.  By far our favorite were the pork bellies with kimchi, peanuts, and chili sauce.  Oh gawd....this small plate alone made the trip worth it.  Yeah, it sounds like a bizarre medley of flavors, but WOW.  Don't leave here without trying it.  Seriously. The fried hominy was fried and salty goodness.  And the biscuit with sausage gravy with foie gras...talk about a crazy combo!  And surprisingly good.  The fancy foie gras goes surprisingly well with the everyman biscuit and gravy. We shared one entree...the fried quail with bacon, mashed potatoes, and greens.  Everytime we eat these little birds, it's hard not to chuckle.  Inch-long drumsticks, breastmeat you can chomp in one little bite...anyways, it was very good.  The batter in particular was very flavorful, crispy, and memorable. We don't normally eat such rich and heavy meals, but if that's your deal, you will love Animal.  We really enjoyed it too despite still being full as we write this!

I get nervous when I go to a place with a group, recommend the place in hoping that everyone enjoys it.  But thank you Animal for living up to expectations. The food was delicious, I would only come here with a group of 4+ so you could sample a wide variety of dishes.  With our group of 5, we went thru 10 dishes and 3 desserts, everyone was full and satisfied.   Heres the breakdown of my favorites: *Hmm one bite left, hope you dont mind if i eat the rest"... grilled octopus quail fry poutine (2x) flat iron foie gras loco moco pound cake tres leches *This is good and damn tasty, but I'll save room for the other dishes* hamachi tostada lamb meatballs barbeque pork belly sandwiches lettuce w/beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac bacon chocolate crunch bar

Of COURSE my friend would pick the only restaurant on the block with no sign for her birthday dinner... and of COURSE she would have already been well into the birthday stupor which would lead her to render herself quite useless as my navigator... and of COURSE i would be the space cadet of the day or month and rendor myself useless as my own navigator as well... (in my defense... i was following google maps on my blackberry which was taking me in a completely different direction than where we were supposed to go) and of COURSE it would be my impaired friend to spot the valet with the signage on our 4th pass of the restaurant... as we entered... the birthday girl jetted straight to the ladies room... now... something a bit strange was the emphasis on the fact that our 4th person was not there... they were by no means rude... and they let us sit down with 3... but the EMPHASIS... first when we were greeted at the door... Us: Reservation for 4 Them: There IS a 4th? Us: Yes, the girl that just ran to the restroom then when we were sat... Them: So there IS a 4th person?

Pour them a damn glass too... (kay it wasn't said like so... but what was with all the emPHAsis? Anyhoo... I digress... Soooo... the good stuff... here is what we ordered: lettuces, sumac vinaigrette, beets, avocado, feta, pita - mmm delicious melted petit basque, chorizo, garlic bread - very tasty for you cheese and chorizo lovers poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - a LOT of fries with gravy... good but not amazing... maybe it was just too much... foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - biscuit was mushy and of course maple gravy made it SUPER sweeet... so be warned... flat iron, potato, morels, truffle parmesan fondue - this was aMAZing... the truffle parmesan fondue was perfect... asparagus, truffle parmesan fondue - tinest dish ever... but very delicious...

The dinner I had at Animal last night was one of the best meals I've had in a long time.  It really was phenomenal start to finish.   Every appetizer, entree, and dessert that every person at my table ordered was awesome.  The wine was great.  And our waiter did something I've never seen before from a waiter which I thought was a nice touch - he sat down at our one empty chair at the table to talk through the menu, but not in a haughty "I know everything about food" or used car salesman "you gotta buy this" attitude.   The ribs appetizer: dope The quail entree: ridiculous The tres leches dessert:  WOW The only less than stellar aspect of the evening is that they didn't have my reservation on their books when I showed up, and we had to wait over 30 minutes to sit down.  And the place was pretty noisy.  But they did give us 50% off on our bottle of wine for F'ing up our resey. All told though, the seeming lack of organization was trumped by the incredible food.  I'd definitely go back.

2nd time visit to Animal with my GF.   Ended up sitting at the counter, but was still a great meal.  Had the following Rod Cod - the capers were tart and the Cod was firm and flakey Bacon Pasta -  salty salty salty.. but good bacon and firm pasta and a smooth sauce make this a winner dish. BBQ Pork Belly Sliders - come on, it's pork belly.  How can this be bad?  This was tender and the cabbage slaw was perfectly paired.   Rabbit Legs -  Didn't really have a good reference point for what Rabbit should be, but if this is it, then it was good.  Like tender, juicy turkey? with a noticeable gaminess to it that made it distinct. Dessert: Pudding w/ Orange zest.  - this was a nice smooth and sweet ending to a rich and fulfilling evening. drinks: locally brewed rootbeer and the mint tea well worth the re-visit.  We were both full but not overly stuffed. Staff was pleasant and super helpful.   Had an all around great evening.

I might get flayed for the average review, but I might as well speak my mind. I wanted to be impressed, expected to be impressed, but came away overall underwhelmed. I sat at the bar with a good friend since I didn't make a reservation, but service and ambiance was still good. The interior is minimalist, but I think a bit drab. The restaurant has no markings so it can be easy to miss. Right next to Canter's. Metered street parking is your only bet but it isn't too hard to find a space nearby. For a restaurant named Animal, it's clever because each dish uses a part of an animal, but it isn't an outright meat fest. Each dish is thought of and prepared with care, plated exquisitely. However, I think it didn't tantalize my tastebuds as much as I would think it would. Began with the marrow bone. I normally don't like marrow, but this was done very nicely with good presentation. A big piece of bone with some fresh chimmichurri sauce. Scoop a bit onto the toast and it's very delicious. Light and tasty. Followed up with the foie gras on biscuit and maple gravy. THIS. That must have been the most delicously savory thing I have ever tasted. I could eat it all day, but it wouldn't be very good for my heart. It's like a tease to my tastes since it is served in a relatively small portion and at a price. But it is certainly worth it. I can still picture the moment of tasting this dish. The balance of the sweetness of the maple gravy and savoriness of the foie gras and lightly salty biscuit... amazing. Bits of sausage also killed it. Now, comes the underwhelming courses. After the scrumptious marrow and foie gras, I was thinking I would ascend to heaven from the next highly rated dishes, but they personally fell flat to me. BBQ Pork Belly Sandwiches. Too rich, too much sauce, fell apart in my hands and one slider is too big for one bite, meat not as tender as I'd imagine rich slow roasted seasoned pork belly to be. Taste wasn't quite there. Next was the raved ox-tail poutine. Compared to the perfectly balanced marrow and foie gras, perhaps it wasn't such a good idea to taste such a heavy dish. This also didn't do it for me. Flavor was very dark and intense. It was hard to take a bite after a few because it was so rich. Perhaps I'm used to a more flavorful Asian ox-tail, but this one was way too strong for my tastes. The fries were also nothing special to me. Finally, I tried the bacon chocolate crunch bar. I was expecting too much like the Vosges Bacon Bar, but this was nothing like it. Strong flavor, the sweetness in my opinion was not balanced well for my tastes since there were parts of mild sweetness and then intense syrup sweetness. The bacon and the chocolate didn't blend that well in my opinion, and I thought the crunch was pretty stale. So, I would for now rate this experience as average. I had two hits out of the park but it was followed by three fouls. However, I would definitely come again to try other dishes to give it a more balanced review as my first experience with dishes not suited for my tastes could be changed if I find other homeruns on the menu. However, despite personal misgivings for certain dishes, I would definitely recommend this establishment to any American food enthusiast. Simply wonderful!

I was supposed to meet a friend for dinner elsewhere in the neighborhood, but she cancelled.  I'd been meaning to try Animal for a while now, and figured this would be a good time... In a word: amazing.  I ordered the fontina and chestnut agnolotti and the veal tongue with smoked foie gras.  The agnolotti was delicious, buttery and slightly on the sweet side, although I found that the pasta itself should have cooked a minute longer, it was a little too chewy at the edges.  However, the veal tongue was outstanding.  The waiter suggested I try everything together (you know, the perfect bite theory), it completely worked. The portions were tapas-sized, but the content was pretty rich, so deprivation you did not feel.  I had a glass of prosecco to cut through the richness.   Oh, yes... and ended with the chocolate bacon crunch bar!  Along with the salt and pepper ice cream, which was kind of odd but I think I preferred it over the chocolate!  Nice was to end the meal, complete with an espresso.  Good, espresso, too... I'd go back.  With or without my friend!  The only thing I do regret was not talking to the gentlemen sitting next to me!

This place has been on my to-eat list for quite some time now and a meat-lover's birthday seemed like the perfect occasion to make the LA trip.  Just casual, good 'ol carnage feast; and I teased: celebrities eat here, you know. You know a restaurant's really something when the only signage is the building number.  Seating is limited in the dim one-room restaurant, that could easily have been a romantic spot if it weren't for the noise level.   LA has this magic to make you feel like every day is a Friday or Saturday night and that Monday night was no different, the room abuzz  with hungry patrons. We stuffed our faces with chicken liver toast (should have ordered two plates!), pig ears (we're Asian!), pork belly sandwiches (sinful!), sweetbreads (not sweet breads!), flat iron (sounds typical, but is anything but!),  and polished the meal off with pound cake and macerated strawberries (in season!).   Oh, and we saw Jonah Hill that night.

I took my BF here for his birthday  a couple months ago.  Excellent, decadent food.   We had the petite basque appetizer, the heirloom tomato salad (yowza! - easily the best heirloom tomato salad ever), and since they ran out of the ribeye for 2, we ended up each getting the flat iron steak.  Luscious buttery goodness and the corn that accompanied was as another Yelper said, perfect.  My BF usually only enjoys corn when on the cob...but he lapped up every last kernel of corn. I actually would give it 4.5 stars because of the decor was really too austere.  And that's saying a lot coming from a lover of minimalist design.  Coulda done without the wood bench seating and the unadorned white walls.  But the flavors will keep me coming back for more.

Why isn't basic customer service not a priority anymore? First we get attitude from the hostess because we don't have a reservation. The hostess got a lot friendlier when she found out that we were willing to wait and she could seat us at the bar if she had to. Don't you think that manager should not complain about their diners who are within view and earshot; especially since his only complaint was that we were not ordering enough. Please, our party still spent over a hundred. I wish I could give you a higher rating because the food was good, but the service just left a bad taste in my mouth. The food: Crispy Chocolate Bacon Bar - rich and creamy with a nice salty crunch Loco Moco - this dish was the hit night Bone marrow - another winner Mint Tea - it's just hot mint water (no need to waste your money on this)

FIRST, here's a tidbit: This restaurant is four doors down from Canters!  If you don't know the area, it can probably take you an extra ten minutes to find the restaurant. Now, you can get a reservation for this place in the same day.   I know this because we did.   The REVIEW: SERIOUS comfort food which made me happy! My friend and I shared the following: -fried hominy with lime -mustard crusted sweetbreads, caper brown butter, bacon -young kale salad, pecorino, lemon vinaigrette, croutons -foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy -duck breast parsnip, prunes, apple, butternut squash The highlights were the kale salad, the fried hominy, and the foie gras.  I was actually a little disappointed that I ended our meal with the duck breast.  I would have preferred to have the skin crispier but the middle was cooked perfect.   A suggestion by our waiter was to try the pork belly with kimchi, peanuts, chili soy, and scallion.  I wanted to tell the waiter that I can't go with his suggestion because I'm Korean and I can eat that at home or at Honey Pig.  It's really nothing special.  :) Anyhow, the bill came out to $100 (including tip and no alcohol).  Not bad because in the end, we were both stuffed.  We were planning on ordering dessert, but there was really no more room.   I think this is a great place to go with friends, not a date.  There's no real ambiance unless the couple happens to be huge foodies and good food is all you need.  While we were there, their lights kept on flickering and my friend was joking how she was two steps away from having a seizure.  How romantic, right?   Anyhow, this place is definitely worth a try.... I'm glad I was finally able to experience the food.

Yes, Animal is all that.. Considering cost/benefit, it is on top of my favorite list. Here is what we had: 1. Baby kale, pecorino, lemon chili vinaigrette, crouton 9.00, This was light but tasty. they brought if first but I think it would have worked well between two meat dishes. 2. Hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut 14.00, This was full of flavor and still on the light side.. WOA (would order again) 3. Barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw 12.00 for 2 pieces. OMG, they are melt in your mouth, rich, bursting with flavor and have a nice chunk of meat along with the fat. WOA 4. Foie gras terrine, boysenberry jam, rose geranium gastrique 20.00. This was an amazing dish, a nice sized slice of foie gras terrine that went really well with the rose flavored gastrique.  I would probably not order it again just because it is so rich, and we ordered more rich food.. 5. Melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread 12.00  Can't really go wrong with melted cheese and chorizo. right? 6. Pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg 12.00  I know, it sounds a little creepy... but  get over it and get it.. It is sliced thinly and kind of crispy with spicy citrusy sauce.. so good.. WOA 7. Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar 16.00  I think they saved best for last. This was awesome. Rich, flavorful non fat oxtail pieces on top of french fries with pieces of cheddar. This was crazy good. I will be dreaming of this everyday until my next visit. WOA 8. Berries, vanilla custard, lavender crumble, opal basil 7.00 This was a nice fruity finishing touch that refreshed the palate after so much richness.. We also ordered the bacon chocolate crunch bar 7.00.. but I thought it was not great.. maybe I am not a big chocolate person. So next time I would probably order some other dessert. They have a small but nice selection of beer and wines and if you don't want alcohol, they have a fresh mint tea. Service was attentive and friendly.

My boyfriend's birthday was on Sunday, so I took him out to dinner on Saturday night at Animal, which is right down the street from us. We love bacon, and heard this was a favorite ingredient of the place, and so we went! The parking in the neighborhood was easy, and they have valet. The Ambiance was nice, almost like a converted loft.  Good vibe. Starters: Fried Sweetbreads with a slab of bacon (thick slice of YUMM YUMM) in a lemon capers sauce.   I was a little scared to get this one--i've never had this dish, and I KNOW what sweetbreads are.  But, it was tasty. The ribs.  wow.  I'm a southern girl, and yet these honey soy glazed ribs might have been the best i ever had.  Add a little bread salad *(panzanella?) and I'm in heaven. Then.... the main course. The 109.  A ribeye steak, bone-in, cooked to perfection.  Did I mention in a foie gras gravy.  WHOA.  With wonderful mashed potatoes. And the Cote de Rhone wine was to-die for. Great, knowledgable service.  Very responsive and attentive.  Didn't upsell.  Just provided good food. We WILL be back. *Note:  I feel like giving this a 5 might seem high, but we caught this place on a GOOD night!! And, I'll be back for ribs and wine for sure!

So our new culinary journey begins with Animal.  I highly recommend getting reservations ahead of time.  We didn't RSVP and waited around, although there was a sea of empty tables around us.  We walked around the neighborhood and came back about an hour later and to our dismay about half the restaurant was still empty, yet the hostess wouldn't seat us.  A quandary I might add.  Luckily two seats opened up at the bar.   We weren't starving so we stuck to appetizers. We started with Grilled Squid, Chorizo, Chimichurri (Very nice cooked to perfection.  The flavors were all nicely played) Pig Ear, Chile, Lime, Fried Egg (The first bite was nice. As I continued to take more, I felt this overwhelming sense that my tastebuds were getting numb from either the chile, lime or the salt.  Very tasty but a little overseasoned.  You can't really taste the pig ear. Pork Belly, Kimchi, Peanuts, Chili soy, scallion (If you can't stand the taste or texture of fat, then don't get this dish.  The kimchi was mild and the sauce was a nice compliment to the pork.  Good as a bite or two. Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy (This dish gave me a punch in the stomach, then an upper cut to the jaw.  The gravy was a salty sugary blend that complimented the starch of the biscuit, while the foie gras was caramelized with a hint of sugary sweetness.  The foie gras mind you was bigger than expected, think about 2/3 the size of your hand.  The flavors were quite explosive.       We finished with the tres leches, dulce de leche ( I must say this dish blew me away.  Very unassuming from the start.  Just visualize a cube of white cake with white frosting. The cake was a little gritty, think rice pudding but firm.  Slam, Bam, Thank you ma'am, I was done after this.  This dessert was like a kid going down a water slide.  FUN, FUN, FUN In summary, the bartender (Solomon) was great.  The food was not uberly the best I've ever had, but I'd try other items when going back.  I wasn't too hot with the pork belly or the pig ear.  Since they have seasonal food, the menu varies wildly.  I'll definitely go back to see what items grace the menu next time. Decor:2 Food:3 Service:3 Would I go back?  You bet your pastrami I would!  Let's try again!

Went here for my birthday. No special treatment. Even though we had reservations, they gave us the shitty table right by the door so whenever the door opened we got the reeeaaalllly cold breeze blew in our faces. That sucked. We ended up ordering the small plates and skipped entrees. We ordered: Pig ears, crispy hominy, beet sumac salad, pork belly sliders, biscuits and gravy, head cheese, sweet breads, and the tres leches cake. My favorites were the biscuits and gravy, pork belly sliders, pig ears and the sumac salad. The food was great. I super loved the atmosphere.

Will definitely be back to let the bf have a try! Food: Everything tastes good here.  Whether or not you're to be impressed might depend on the dish you order.  (ex. the MEATS are to die for, see below) We started off with (i don't remember the actual names of the dishes): - Baby broccoli - good, nothing spectacular.  Good portion for its price. *** - Pasta with lamb sausage - the sausage was very tasty, the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, however it was a tad bit on the salty side.  *** - Raw yellow tail on wonton cracker topped with greens - fish was fresh, everything good **** At this point in the night, although everything was good, I was a little underwhelmed.  We waited for quite a while for the next set of dishes (all meats).  The ambiance of the restaurant was nice and there is a good wine selection.  So while drinking and chatting, we didn't mind waiting too much.  Then the REAL food came out.  THE MEATS were the real stars of the night: -Flat iron steak with basque cheese on top - WONDERFUL! great flavors with the cheese (I thought it would be too heavy) very very juicy steak.  We ordered medium rare and it definitely came out rare, but since all of us were meat lovers, no complaint here.  But a little surprised that a high end place can't get its steak right.  I find that it was a bit overpriced for the portion size as well.  27 dollars for 7 bites.  Very good regardless. **** -Ribs - tender! soft! falls right off the bone! perfectly cooked ***** -Foie gras - heaven! gravy and biscuit complemented it perfectly.  I usually never order foie gras due to the controversy of it being inhumane, but since it was in front of me I had to give it a taste.  Definitely worth it and if I come back, I'll be ordering it again. ***** Atter these three I was so more than satisfied.   But we kept going... -Toasted bread with petit basque - Cheesy, oniony.  It was ok.  It was a little burned around the edges.  The toast was very good, they charged us extra for extra bread (it only came with 4 slices).  ** -Bacon Chocolate/ Coffee cake - the chocolate was good, wasn't crazy about it though.  Their desserts don't shine at all.  ** for both.   Service was decent, though a little slow with the meats. But our waiter was very attentive.  They changed our plates to clean ones three times.  A little overkill, but it was nice while we were waiting.   It was a busy night, the restaurant was packed on a Thursday evening.  Atmosphere is great!  Kind of a hipster/older crowd, the bar is poppin.  But everyone minds themselves.  Will be back to have the foie gras again and try some other things!

Finally made it after getting well lubricated on some gin at The Dime across the street and  liked it much more than expected.  Not nearly as douchy as i expected, the staff was rather nice, atmosphere mellow, hippidy hop playin (chuckles at old people bobbin their heads to GThang, while eating Foie Gras) Glad i brought my own wine (great Syrah) because the L Preston we had after it wasn't as nice as I remember.  Although the 20$ corkage means i'll be trying their other wines, the LP was the only Cali wine which is pretty lame The food was very interesting although obviously and understandably expensive (the demand warrants it) liked these: Liver toasts Hamachi tostada Bacon bar loved these: Pig ears (got 2) Pork belly sandwiches Balsamic pork ribs Grilled octopus Veal brains Foie gras terrine Tres leches really wanted to try the marrow bone, pig tails, poutine but they were out Well worth the occasional visit.

Wow, wow and wow.  Animal is ridiculously decadent and oh-so-yummy.    I went to Animal for the first time in a group of 6 for my boyfriend's birthday.  We all looked over the menu online to get a basic idea of what to expect, and i know that I couldn't have been more intrigued or excited.   While you can certainly enjoy Animal with less people in your party, the menu seems to be geared towards larger parties.  The show stoppers are served tapas-like and you will walk away with a greater understanding of who these chefs really are--and more importantly--the food is orgasmic, so try everything you can.   I generally like to talk about the ambiance, but i walked away with such a high, i don't really remember what it looked like.  Here's a quick rundown--small, quaint, cozy, and cute.  Great for dates and near the grove. There you go.   Now! The food.  Once seated, we spent no more than five minutes before we made up our minds.  We ordered our wine (they have a lovely selection of reds) and anxiously waited for our food.   Petite Basque--almost like a reduced french onion soup with chorizo.  Served was some darn good garlic bread.  Effing good!  Comes out piping hot, and you just can't scoop enough of it onto your bread--delicious!  It was so good, it was hard to be polite.  We ordered 2--and still, it was still really difficult to share.   Quail fry and grits--super good.  The quail was very tasty and moist and the grits were wonderful.  Great, but certainly was not my favorite.  This shouldn't by any means keep you from ordering it, but if you are limited to just 3-4 dishes, I'd opt for something else.  My friend would say otherwise--she couldn't get enough.   BBQ pork belly sandwiches--*droooool.  Tender. Fatty.  Flavored to perfection.  Freaking awesome.  The pork belly just melted.  So Good! Foie gras, biscuit, and maple sausage gravy--We ordered one.  Everyone took a bite, and we couldn't hail down our waitress fast enough to get two more.  OMFG was this crazy good.  Individually, you may know what this tastes like. Throw all these ingredients together, and it's like an explosion in your mouth.  HANDS DOWN, my favorite dish here.  Be forewarned, it is heavy (as you can imagine)...but you simply can not skip this.   Pork Belly with Kimchi--My 2nd favorite dish--and boy was it close.  The pork belly came out fatty and crunchy and tender in all the right places.  Fatty? Heck yeah.  Worth it?  We ordered two.  It was amazing.  The kimchi was a great accompaniment as well.  The kimchi was more like a Korean inspired slaw than what you would expect out of traditional kimchi, but it was awesome.  A must have dish.  I think most people would agree.   We also had some sort of sushi dish--fresh white fish sliced thinly with grapefruit.  Good, but really not worth it.  As you can see, it was almost forgettable.   We finished off our meal with an order of the Balsamic ribs.  It was huge, and perfect for a large group.  I was pretty stuffed and was saving what stomach space i had left for dessert.  The boys couldn't get enough.   Finally, dessert.  We ordered everything on the menu--tres leches, bacon chocolate bar, strawberry shortcake, and pudding in a jar.  They were all fantastic--but I must say, I took a strong liking to the tres leches.  It was just sooooooooooooooo good.  The chocolate bacon bar was also a hit with everyone else.  I'm not huge on dense amounts of chocolate, so i stuck to the two cakes.  Definately worth trying.   Animal is a gem.  They change their menu's often, but they seem to keep their staples.  Pricey, but well worth it.  I would DEFINITELY be back.

There are a lot of really good things to say about Animal.  The staff was great and they were more then accomindating with us even without any reservations.  All that stuff was great. Now that we have that out of the way... What we really want to talk about is the PORK BELLY SLIDERS!  Without a doubt those sliders are the best we've ever had.  That's saying a lot from me cause we order sliders all the time.  It's funny cause we went in there because of the "best thing I ever ate" show about the chocolate bacon bar.  Honestly the chocolate bar was good but the only thing we can remember about Animal are those Tangy, Fat-filled, Sliders!

Don't know why it took me so long to actually eat here... this is definitely in the running for my favorite restaurant in L.A. I had five dishes and every single one made my mouth so happy. Perfect balance of quality meats and exquisite flavors. Still dreaming of the flat-iron steak with the truffle parmesan fondue or the six-hour bolognese polenta or the baby broccoli with pancetta and egg... this is my kind of comfort food.

Very small, trendy West Hollywood restaurant. The food was very fresh, unique and presented nicely. Wine, 5 small plates, dessert were about $120. There are about 15 tables, so it is intimate. On the night we were there, we had several television actors from Glee and Parenthood dining near us.

Animal was a really nice surprise. There was no sign on the facade, but it was pretty easy to spot. We had reservations for 7:30, but arrived a bit late due to traffic. We called on the way, so there were no problems, and we were seated right away. The place was packed, and the noise level was a bit on the high side. The place was nicely designed, with neat naked light bulbs and angular, contemporary accents making for a nice atmosphere... sans the noise. Our hostess was a darling. She walked us through the menu, which changes daily, and was very helpful with wine selection and had a generally interested and buoyant attitude. Fun. We started off with the foie gras with biscuit and ordered the 109 for two, which is basically a humongous bone-in prime rib slab. The foie gras was amazing. Rich, great texture, very flavorful. The prime rib was expertly cooked. We opted for a medium rare, and were a bit worried that it would be overcooked, but our fears were allayed upon first bite. The caramelization on the outer edges of the prime rib was a highlight. Parts of the meat simply melted in our mouths. The mashed potatoes that came with the meal were equally of high quality. We couldn't finish our meal, and we had no room for dessert, so unfortunately, I can't comment on that. Awesome food aside, Animal has 2 things going against it, and if you can get over those, I can highly recommend it. First off, it's a bit loud. The stark, austere design influence looks great, but I don't think the designers took acoustics into consideration. The space is basically a big, hollow chamber, and voices travel quite easily. It's almost distractingly loud. Second, and this was a big one for me, the red wine came chilled. I'm just not used to that. It was a very good wine, just not at the temperature I was expecting. To sum it all up, amazing food, cold red wine, a bit noisy, but nice to look at.

This place is the aesthetic opposite, but similar demographic, to Luna Park. If LP can be faulted for its lack of creativity and lauded for its consistency, Animal is the opposite. I almost feel bad giving Animal one more star than Luna, but truth be told, I'm a culinary risk taker, and Animal has provided me with some Edible Ileads I won't forget soon. Half of what I've had here has been incredible, original, and subject for conversation for weeks. The other half has elicited a response of "Cool, risky idea, but sadly it just doesn't work out, and I don't want to eat any more of it," so bear that in mind. Oh - Run intimately and often in person by the chefs of "Two Guys and a Catering Company." Great place to bring Food Network Snobs haha! If you want a risk, go for the craziest looking thing on the menu, which changes regularly. They know their way around game (both pheasant and rabbit) and sweetbreads (all very rare for the west coast). If you just want a plain ol (but perfectly done!) steak - you might want to look elsewhere - Animal tries new, fresh things out on a nearly daily basis, and are very receptive to your feedback. But if you just want a solid strip steak, you might find said perfectly cooked steak covered in a crazy sauce or marinade that you weren't expecting. Oh, it's very hard to avoid meat here - it's what they do best, and better than most in LA. Guys - if your lady loves a cut of meat, bring her here. Service is intimate and friendly - our waiter on one occasion recommended one of the best bottles of noir I've ever had (for under $40). The restaurant is small, so do call ahead. One of the few low-key places for LA foodies to go on a delicious adventure, without necessarily breaking the bank. Oh - sorry, the bacon chocolate bar did NOT do anything for me haha! If you want dessert, they have many more creative options, I think.

I don't know what kept me, a true and dedicated eater of all things carnivorous from land and sea, away from Animal for so long. Husband and I took the bus out there one early Thursday evening and had the best of everything dining has to offer. Food, service, wine, and good company.  I took loads of pics of the food for my blag and have been too lazy to post them. But I can honestly say every dish was better than the last. Can't wait to go again. We couldn't get a reservation last minute, but we really enjoyed sitting at the bar chatting with the tender and the rest of the staff who happened to need to visit the bar frequently for whatnot. Everyone is very down to Earth and seem to love working there. Clientele was that combo of east side of LA warmth and Westside status. I didn't mind it.

Super cool place! I planned on having dinner on a Monday night. Made a reservation and was really excited about the food. I arrived on time and made my way to the bar. Cool spot, design was really simple. Extremely loud inside,  perhaps some sound foam would help.  After my friend arrived we sat at our table and looked over the menu. I was excited to  say the least with all the choices. So i convinced my guest that we should perhaps order all of the appetizers... This way we can try everything on the menu, I usually do this at chef driven restaurants as it allows me to see more of the chefs creativity. We enjoyed most of the dishes, the chicken livers were nice and "Livery"  and the Mini Petite Basque was awesome!  Overall the appetizers were very tasty... We then decided to order dinner, both myself and my guest ordered the Lamb and Halibut with King Crab, I have to say that unfortunately we were unable to eat our dinner, as the waiter dragged out our order. Over forty five minutes later we still had not received our entrees, we asked the waiter what happened and he said that" due to the way we ordered, we made it difficult for the kitchen to keep up" . Not exactly sure what he meant or why we were even told that. We asked for the food to go and were charged for them. The manager came to our table and apologized for the inconvenience, however, I expected more from these guys. I will be sure to give them another try, perhaps it was just an off night....

Pure indulgence is what comes to mind when I think of Animal. Came here for the first time this past Tuesday night and I fell in love with this restaurant!! The food as many fellow yelpers say is very innovative and creative. I would have to say its a meat lover's heaven and totally different from anything I have eaten. What we ordered: Pig Ears: Doesn't sound too appetizing but it was actually good. This dish was tangy and very flavorful. The pig ears were crunchy but also moist. This dish also had fried egg that was laid right on top of the pieces of  pig ears which complemented the flavor of this dish very well. Duck Confit: This dish was magnificent. The duck was crispy on the outside and moist in the inside. It came on top of a bed of arugula, thinly slice apples, dates and pecans. The mixture of everything gave this plate a nice flavor..everything reallly complemented each other very well. Sweetbreads: This dish consists of sweetbreads, hen of the woods mushrooms, capers and creamed of spinach. This dish was also very flavorful and good. This is my first time ever eating sweetbread and surprisingly it was quite tasty. BBQ Pork belly sandwiches: OMG, this dish was so gooood!!! The pork belly was succulent, tender and practically melted in your mouth. The bread used for this sandwich was super soft. It was a fantastic dish. Poutine, oxtail gravy and cheddar: This was a pretty large dish. It was quite delicious but I have to say very filling though, we ended up taking half of it togo. The oxtail was tender and had so much flavor. The fries and cheddar that came with the dish was very good also. Even though I was quite full, I really wanted to try the bacon crunch bar so I ordered it togo. I took a bite in the car and thought it was pretty tasty. The mixture of the bacon bits and chocolate actually tasted pretty good together. It was salty yet sweet at the same time. The chocolate used was quite smooth and decadent. Total cost for 5 appetizers, 1 dessert, 1 half bottle of Pinot and 2 bottle of beer was $153 with tip included. I definitely have become a fan of Animal and can't wait till the next time I dine here again.

SAVE THE VEGETABLES! EAT MEAT! While this isn't their motto, it should be. In particular, if you enjoy the mystery of the offal-the-beaten-path meats, this place is for you. I was here with a large crew (9 people), and we tried just about everything on the menu. The haze of food coma the over satiety of decadence is borderline overtaking me, but  I'm writing anyway. A very cool place, with nice clean ambiance, not overly swankadelic, but enough to justify putting on a little lipstick and maybe your second-favorite pair of heels to go out to dinner. Low lit, with upbeat music (through the fever of fois gras I remember hearing Prince at one point), but not overly loud that I couldn't hear the other people at my table. But let's be realistic, if you're reading this and making reservations at Animal, you're going for the food, heels or no heels. So here it is: The winners: -House Cab-- actually quite nice for the bottle price, so if you have a crew at  the table, just go for it. Not too big to overpower all the richness that you're about to experience, but blended nicely with most dishes. -Chicken Liver Toast- one of the best, and cheapest things on the menu. I honestly could have that and I'd be a happy camper, except for the fact that then there's... -Hamachi Tostada- Thick slabs of buttery yellowtail layered on a fried tortilla with a mound of cilantro-jalapeno cabbage-like slaw. Tang/fried/butter and balanced, except for... -Fois Gras Terrine- the jelly with the honey-like drizzle on the plate smeared onto crusty butter-grilled pieces of bread= heaven. Get it!!!! -Fois Gras and Biscuit- Seared slab of fois gras gives it a delightfully carcinogen crust with a liquified pudding beneath... oh yeah, there's a biscuit, but that's really not what's important. -Fried Veal Sweetbreads- While I'd never know what part of the animal it was underneath the crispy breadcrumb crust, the narrow tang of the finger lime aioli totally made the dish. Honorable Mention; -The Polenta was divine. If mashed potatoes, a soufflé and masa harina had a love child, it would be this polenta. There's some nice bolognese on top, but the polenta itself was what was unique -Bone Marrow: gelatinous and buttery at the same time, but the chimichurri on top really balances it out. Save your calories: the bacon-chocolate bar. While it was delicious, with the richness of everything else on the menu, i think my tastebuds had lost the ability to taste pork fat, so you could have told me it was just a dark chocolate bar and I would've believed you. In short, one of the most unique and memorable meals of recent memory, and I'll begin saving up my pennies to go back, and dream of forbidden fois until then!

this place is INCREDIBLE. was late on the draw and could only get reservations for 10:30 pm (not your typical dinner hour). boy am i glad we went. everything was so good. we had four plates between the two of us (plus dessert). this was my first time trying foie gras and it was awesome, the bone marrow was equally as good. people who have posted negative comments are just bitter they can't afford to eat here everyday. next time i'm in LA, i'll be back! nom nom nom!!

Thanks, Animal, for providing me with a thoroughly enjoyable dining experience!  I loved the minimalist and modern decor.  I loved our friendly, attentive, and informative server.  But most importantly, I loved the food!   I started with the amberjack/chilli/fruit appetizer.  That tuna was so good and fresh, I probably could've had it just by itself.  But I still liked how the serranos and nectarines added some nice extra flavors to the dish. For my main course I had the flat iron steak.  Now, I have to stop right here and mention that I am not the biggest steak person, but this flat iron was awesome!  It was the most satisfying meal I've had in a while, swirling each cut of steak with the corn, potatoes, and bordelaise sauce, combining it into a perfect savory bite each time.  Delicious! For dessert, I split the famous bacon chocolate crunch bar with my table, and it was...good.  I can't really rave about it since bacon doesn't do much for me, but it was definitely an interesting combination of textures and flavors, and I always have to give it up for creativity. Again, great job all around, Animal!  Next time I'm craving a great steak, I know exactly where to go.

You guys, seriously, SERIOUSLY, this place is not even a "must", it's a "have to" restaurant.  You have to go here.  Or something terrible will happen, such as the possibility that you will not experience the most gorgeous melding of flavors, textures and colors in your mouth, and then you will eventually die after living a disappointing life.  Although the menu changes, I believe some of their staples remain every day, so if you happen to stumble upon a menu that features any of the following, order it and thank me later: - roasted pork salad, celery, red onion, olive oil (spicy, refreshing, salty, delish) - baby broccoli, pancetta, parmesan, soft egg, bread crumbs (probably my favorite thing we ordered) - poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar (the wanna-be Canadian in me cried a little - this felt like the home I never had) - fluke, grape & yuzu granita, apple, orange, serrano, mint (like jumping into a pool on a hot day) - tres leches, dulce de leche (super sweet, but super tasty) - bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise (I think this is a must in a restaurant called Animal - the crunch is the bacon, and the chocolate is superb) joe's doughnuts, cinnamon sugar, caramel (if not for the broccoli, this would have been the best thing we ordered). I feel like a mother hen, releasing her baby hens into the world.  Go children, make smart choices and for god's sake, eat at Animal.

Great food!  Had the pig ear, rabbit loin, and pork belly sliders. The rabbit loin is incredible.  There's not much of it, but the meat is amazingly soft and juicy and it's served with pistachios and a fantastic sauce. Very highly recommended. The pig ear is pretty good - it's crispy and flavored with (perhaps a bit too much) lime and something spicy, all under an egg.  Goes great with beer, but otherwise was probably my least favorite of the 3. The pork belly sliders were fantastic, of course.  How can you go wrong with pork belly?  There was some kind of slaw with the meat - it worked very well.  Highly recommended. Overall - I'd love to come here again.  There are some really delicious-sounding things on the menu that we never got to try.

I have to start this review off by coming clean. I'm not usually a meat kind of girl. You know - that chewy, overcooked, tough typical slab of meat that you can get anywhere? I'm not such a fan of working my jaw to soreness. Call me crazy, but the meal that I had at Animal was the best meat meal that I've ever had. If every meat dish was like a dish from Animal, I definitely wouldn't mind it. Animal knows their meats - how to cook it, serve it, and how to get it to my tummy. Felicia C. and I had ressies here this past weekend, and I was not disappointed by my meal. We started off with the chicken liver toast and the pig ear, chili, lime, with fried egg. Next, the barbeque pork belly sandwiches with slaw and the sweetbreads with creamed spinach, capers, and hen of the woods came out. We also savored the roasted marrow bone with parsley salad. Out of our five apps, only the pig ear was slightly meh. I'd urge you to at least try the pork belly sandwiches. The chicken liver toast was notably good too - and very reasonably priced. Our split entree was, of course, the Loco Moco burger. A bed of rice under a hamburger patty and topped off with Spam, a generous slice of fois (give it to me anytime, baby), and a delicate little quail egg. I'd take this burger over another anytime. NOTE: Careful of the directions when you type it into driving aides - it's not at Samy's Cameras (which is S. Fairfax). I made that sad sad mistake and was delayed from my delicious food by a few precious moments.

With a name like Animal, why would anyone come to this restaurant for the salads? The Cougar Contingent at the next table were all about their salads. Well, good for them. Our table was all about the meats. Summary: - Minimalistic decor. The name of the restaurant is not even displayed on the outside - Good Service Food: - Poutine with Oxtail Stew: Yummy! The fries were still crunchy when they brought them out, the stew was tasty and the oxtail was fall of the bone tender. A little salty though - Grilled Octopus: Very tasty dressing on the octopus. It was also done just right - Baked Petit Basuqe with grilled bread: The cheese was melted Goodness! Yum! - Foie Gras Loco Moco: When i lived in Hawaii, Loco Mocos were my fave b'fast dish, so i was dying to try this. Foie Gras- Very tasty, silky and done perfectly Quail Egg- I do wish it were a slightly bigger egg because part of the loco experience is the runny egg which makes the loco creamy. But this was delish Spam- I've never had spam with my loco moco, so this was interesting. It actually went well with the dish Burger Patty: Done the way i requested, medium rare So yes, this was probably the most expensive Loco Moco i've ever had, but it was innovative and decadent Bacon Crunch Bar: Exactly like what we had anticipated. It was slightly smoky and I liked it; we shared it among the 5 of us- it was RICH! A fun, interesting experience

I really want to eat at every Food Network Stars' restaurant to see if it's TV magic, or if the food is as great as it looks. Sometimes I'm disappointed, but with Animal, I was very excited to find that the restaurant is amazing.  In one night, with one meal, it became my favorite restaurant.  This is amazing for me because I've never had a favorite restaurant (maybe Taco Bell when I was12).  This restaurant epitomizes amazing and creative food. I wrote a full article about this on my blog too if you want to read it, but I don't want to copy and paste what I wrote.  I feel like it'd be too long.

Food: 4 and half stars Price:3 stars( it should be 4 stars, but I will tell you why later,,) Service: 3 stars( the same reason as price) Atmosphere: 4 stars We had Amberjack nectarine, citrus, mint, chili http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Chicken liver toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Grilled squid, chorizo, chimmi churri( I forgot to take photos) Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread http://www.yelp.com/biz_… For desert, bacon chocolate crunchi bar, S&P anglaise( I was too full to think about taking photos at this time) The reason I didn't want to give 4 stars for service and price because I was charged $6 for open bottle fee. They should let customers know such rules as they mention about 18% gratuity added to parties of 6 or more on the menu. The server also should have asked me if I was having more than 2 glasses of wine since they served Carafe.( maybe it's my problem that I didn't order Carafe) The food was pretty good. I enjoyed Amberjack very much. Foie Gras with maple sausage was too sweet for me. Also the melted petit basque with bread was like "Meh", because I know I can make that at home. I like the squid dish, but chorizo was odd. The chicken liver toast was actually my favorite and I know I can make that at home,too. I like this place more than AOC where I have dined recently, but for $100, I would rather eat sushi. That's just my preference.Honestly, the chicken liver toast or melted petit bisque dishes are easy to make at home. It's not the worth money.

I had the best night at Animal. I was going with reservations (the prejudiced kind, not the kind that guarantees seating), thinking I would end up in an overpriced American bistrot. Instead, we had some of the best food I have had in LA, including dessert, and worth every penny (many pennies, though!) We shared appetizers for the whole table, with a bottle of their more-than-decent house red wine. The rabbit loins were amazing, and so was the quails, cheese and chorizo, etc. Then, the flat iron steak was a delight. The desserts, bacon chocolate crunch bar and tres leches, were heavenly. No need for long descriptions: just go to animal and enjoy. And don't even think getting a table without calling days in advance.

Tried the pig ear after reading through all the reviews and maybe it was a case of the hype kinda killing it for me, but ... like most everything on the menu - interesting, reminiscent of the lime and chili mexican candy, but not the best of what we tried.   Enjoyed the pig tail croquette (probably more than the pig ear) and were absolutely falling over ourselves for the foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy.  Not being able to decide between the loco moco and the that app, the server recommended the foie gras and biscuit to showcase the foie gras (mmmmm). Agree with most of the reviewers that the service was fantastic with about 5 different people stopping by the table to check on us (small party of 2).  Made reservations that we were late for, but they were still very accomodating.  Best to make a reservation if going between 7 - 8:30p (later evening during the week for a better chance of walk-ins).

Wholy crap. This place is Heaven in LA.  We had the pleaure of dining her a week or so back and this place is worth every penny. We ordered: Appetizers: Pig Ear w/chili, lime, and a fried egg Poutine BBQ pork belly sliders Entrees: Deep Fried Quail with grits and chard Foie gras loco moco Steak with artichock hash Rib eye steak for two w/escargots Dessert: Donuts Bacon chocolate crunch bar My favorites-- the pork ear, pork sliders, fried quail and the loco moco. The pork ear was my #1-- it's sliced into thin pieces, the deep fried, and has lime and chili sprinked on... all topped with a fried egg. DAH-VINE! The Bacon crunch bar- which I saw Duff from Aces of Cakes raving about, 'wasn't all that' in my opinion. I guess I'm not a sweet + savory type of girl. There's a $20 corkage, which is totally worth it. Go on, try this place, you won't be sorry!

we ate at animal last year and i pretty much spent the last 11 months fantasizing about the fried quail we had there. i would bring it up out of nowhere, on long drives, in the shower, watching pigeons crap on our car. me: "babe, remember that fried quail at animal?" the husband "yes. damn good." me, sighing like a lovesick teenager: "i know." so when we came back down to LA for the weekend, we had to go back. to my dismay, the fried quail was no longer on the menu. i'm not gonna lie that i was slightly depressed for a moment. but then i saw bone marrow on the menu and cheered up. (also, i have so much respect for restaurants that change it up. like any relationship, you've got to keep things interesting.) so here's the breakdown: --smoked trout salad. if you liked smoked fish, you gotta get this. it's got a sweet corn vinagrette and some bacon. yeah, bacon and smoked fish. genius. --bone marrow with chimichurri. typically i don't think bone marrow needs anything. it's so buttery, meaty good, but i have to say, i kind of loved it paired up with the fresh herbal chimichurri. it gave it a whole new dimension. --thai style quail, bbq'd with a sweet, plummy sauce and paired up with this amazing fruit ambrosia. the last time i had ambrosia i was 14 and at my grandma's house for easter sunday. grandma made it with canned fruit, and it was sicky-sweet and just gross. but at animal, it was light and airy, and of course the fruit was fresh and the sauce was made with yogurt. just yum. --crispy rabbit legs, with meyer lemon aioli and green beans. sounds heavy, but isn't. the lemon aioli is so light, it reminds me of a greek tzaziki yogurt sauce. and those legs were delish. btw, why don't we eat rabbits more? we almost skipped out on dessert. last year it was a bit of a letdown and made us wish we had ordered another meat dish, but we wanted to try again so we shared the sticky toffee pudding and i'm so glad we did. get this. trust me. still ranks at one of my most favorite restaurants. (altho their wine list kills me. bottles start at around $60, which is just BS, there is so much good wine out there for much less. it's the only way they seem like their trying too hard. but i can't stay away from that food, so what the hell.)

Never thought I would be saying this, but this is my kind of restaurant, especially since at one time I was a vegetarian for 15 years, but thankfully no more. Simple dishes but complex flavors at the same time and just really damn good. Tried the duck confit and rib eye for two, AMAZING!!!! the word heaven comes to mind. The only thing I regret is not trying the tres leches, but then I know I will be back. I love the laidback atmosphere, I am lean more towards that versus all these overgrown trendy restaurants popping up in Los Angeles. I like an more intimate, cozy dining experience.

Came here for birthday dinner with the bf :D I am a serious foie gras lover so imagine my excitement when there are three foie gras dishes on the menu. yes!  The style is small plates so I would recommend ordering a couple things and doing it family style.  We ordered 5 dishes and 2 desserts (a little excessive but it was my birthday). 1. My favorite thing of all time was the foie gras maple gravy biscuit dish.  WOW.  Next time I go i have to get my own because that was possibly the most delicious thing i've had in my entire life.  I might even have to get two. (ok that's excessive) 2. foie gras loco moco.  A little salty for my taste but the sauce they put on the plate was really tasty. 3. The poutine was good too.  This is a good option if you need something filling since it's french fries and fatty delicious ox tail. 4. The hamachi tostada was really good too. Probably my second favorite thing.  Really light and simple but delicious. 5.  The thai bbq quail was good but not spectacular.  The half my bf ate  was actually way undercooked (read: rare) when we got it.  However, they offered to make us a new one and when we declined they did take it off the menu.  Three people actually came to apologize so it wasn't that big of a deal. 6. Sticky toffee pudding was good.  It's a really intersting texture. 7.  Bacon chocolate crunch bar was meh.  I thought the bacon should have been a little sweeter.  Also i'm not a fan of dark chocolate so that's big reason why i wasn' t into it Service was good.  For some reasons they give you new silverware and plates for every single course...fancy but a little wasteful in my opinion. Overall, i love this place dearly.  Can't wait to go again.  Also the prices actually aren't that bad.  It was only 130 for the both of us including tax and tip (we didn't drink though).

The poutin is out of this world (yelling)! I have never been an oxtail fan but it doesn't get any better than when used to smoother french fries and topped with cheese. Its the uber gourmet version of chili fries and you would be ABSURD to not order this to start. Which brings me to...drumroll please...the TRES LECHES CAKE. It makes me want to throw a tantrum in the restaurant each time. I have even gone to the lengths of just ordering it on its own, to go. THIS DESSERT IS IN THE TOP 5 FAVORITE THINGS IVE EVER EATEN...which is a HUGE deal. I think i should receive a commission off the amount of people I've sent to Animal for this dessert specifically. I am a tres leches connoisseur and besides a hole in the wall Mexican restaurant in Rockville, MD NOTHING and i mean nothing comes close to the how amazing this one is. Makes Porto's tres leches cake taste like an O-cello sponge. thought I'd share!

WARNING----THIS WON'T BE PRETTY YELPERS! I'M GOING TO BE BLUNT! Animal is the WORST restaurant I've EVER encountered. I wouldn't eat it if they PAID me! I got FOOD POISONING when I was there and ate their disgusting meat, I had to go to the ER it was so bad. This was about 1 week ago. A friend of mine called and said her boss went last night and got VIOLENTLY ILL as well! He ate the pig ear.. (don't worry pig, it wasn't your fault, it was Animal's for using you to feed people)   The worst part is, when I called to explain, they were exceptionally RUDE and basically called me a liar!! I suppose they'll start believing it when more an more people get sick and eventually the health dept starts investigating it! DON'T RISK IT PEOPLE! There are TONS of other GREAT restaurants in LA!

You really have to respect Animal. Its basically raising the finger at CA cuisine and other LA food trends and doing its own thing. Sitting in between counterculture high-end skate shops is a perfect location for Animal. There dishes are innovative, very original, and some are really in your face decadent. There Foie gras over biscuits and gravy was ridiculously good. If you thrive on places that give you new experiences... new flavor profiles that would never cross your mind as going together... you gotta try this place. Its difficult finding places like Animal in LA... a place that is not following... a place that is doing its own thing with complete disregard to LA fads. Animal is by far one of the best restaurants  in LA!

Stomping around Hollywood's nightclubs, we built up a thirst for parton. (Record Scratch) -instead our host decided that it was time to sober up and get some food. Rather thanking us to a typical late-night destination like Jerry's, my LA connoisseur of all things posh, took us for a five course meal at Animal. As he loves to over-order, we had pretty much everything on the menu. The Heirloom Tomatoes had a FANTASTIC vinaigrette. The foie gras biscuit was scrumptious. However, I absolutely LOVED the flat iron steak with the truffle Parmesan fondue. UNREAL!!

'A little too much...and then some.' Should be the motto and subtitle to the aptly named Animal restaurant located charmingly jewish district of N Fairfax.  This came to mind as I was walking to the restaurant and noticed 'Menorahs for sale' next door.  You're greeted with a subtle and low key storefront with NO SIGN or anything to indicate you've reached your destination, other than the valet parking booth set out front promptly at opening time on 6:15.  Space is limited and acoustics are ok, but once the place gets packed, and it will quickly, the echoes will start the build and reverberate, but at least I could hear most of my company without shouting too loud. Now onto the food.  As the name implies, this is an uncompromising carnivores delight, but maybe for even some of the more dedicated meat eaters, they may find themselves begging for some obligatory greens and fiber to help stave off the seizing they may feel in the chest and liver areas after a night of gastronomic debauchery. Having dined here twice now I've been given a fair sampling of many of the menu's highlights, but the fact they rotate items on/off the menu on the weekly basis does give one motivation to return again, even if they think they tried it all. To sum up the items from my last 2 dining experiences: BBQ Pork Belly sliders - thick juicy cuts of pork belly, so tender they will melt in your mouth with almost a complete absence of gristle, lightly seasoned, not drowned with BBQ sauce topped off with slaw and served on a brioche bun, they come in the perfect size to enjoy all that porky goodness without feeling excess guilt. Pig ears, chili, lime, fried egg - the trick is to take the egg and stir it up in the tender, crispy and seasoned pig ears to give a flavor mix that combines rich and spicy.  My first pig ear experience at another restaurant was a pretty miserable one as they were overcooked and crunchy, but Animal's version eliminates all memories of that with their light crispiness devoid of any chewiness. Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - The breakfast item from hell. Unlike many places that serve foie gras in town, this item comes with a very healthy piece of fatty duck liver thats braised to a perfect golden brown and goes extremely well with the maple sausage gravy soaked biscuit, going well with the nutty, creamy texture of the foie. Bone marrow, chimichurri - I honestly dont know if this is marrow from a cow or another 4 legged beast, it is an interesting taste experience at best and never having had roasted marrow before, I have little to compare to.  What saves this dish is the addition of the chimichurri which not only provides much needed color but gives some bite to the otherwise bland, fatty, buttery texture of the marrow, which is meant to be spread on the toast that accompanies it.  Think of it as a fatty, heart-attack inducing marmalade. Carrot salad - the simplicity and dainty size of this obligatory greens dish almost makes the point to the diner 'seriously...why?  you know why you came here...'  still a little guilt relief is better than none. Duck confit, pecans, dates, arugula - I've had this twice now and this prepared leg of duck doesn't fail to please.  Crispy skin is matched by juicy, dark duck meat which falls right off the bone with the slightest urging of your fork and knife.  Plus its one of the favorite plating presentations for reasons even unclear to me. Hamachi tostada - this was the opening appetizer of my second trip to Animal, and a good one to start. Yellowtail sashimi topped with slaw and fried onions was one of the lightest and cleanest dishes of the night, if we had eaten it later, the delicate flavors would have been drowned out by the items preceeding it. Rabbit loin, country ham, spring beans, spaetzel - What looks like a bit of a visual mess on the plate was better once sampled.  Still compared to the other dishes I had, this one seemed a little disjointed as one flavor didn't really have any relation or bearing to the other.  Perhaps I'm just not a rabbit fan...to eat anyway, or maybe the thinly sliced proschuitto style ham looked too much like skin sloughing off the rabbit. Poutine, ox tail gravy, cheddar - One of the personal favorites of the night, and a combination of ingredients that would do Quebec'rs proud.  A plateful of this obscenity is guaranteed to sit in your stomach all night, but on a cold, wintry candian night, I can't think of better company.  I'm craving more just thinking about it. Foie gras loco moco - despite already having one foie gras item for the night, I broke my personal rule and went for what I thought was the top crown of decadence.  Foie gras stacked on top of a burger patty stacked on top of spam atop rice, all capped off with the signature fried egg all drowned in gravy.  You won't find this version in your local hawaiian plate lunch joint.  It was about this time I was thinking 'ok I overdid it'

Horrendous service. Decent food. We had a going away dinner for our friend at Animal and unfortunately, it sorta sucked. We originally had a reservation for eight at 9:15p. We had to add two more people for a total of ten and they told us it would be an extra 10-15 mins. Fine, we said, and headed over to The Dime, a bar across the street. (The Dime was actually really nice). 9:53p rolls around and they finally give us a call to let us know our table is ready. We head back to Animal.. and.. they've put an extra chair at an eight-top-table. We had to ask for another chair and the manager brought it over. He shoved it on the side that already had an extra chair and expected us to play musical chairs and all shuffle over. I picked up the chair despite his weak, confused protest and physically moved it to the right side of the table instead of having five people switch chairs. The server took a while and seemed confused. We asked for a bottle of wine on one side of the table and he didn't ask the rest of us for drink orders. We ordered basically every appetizer.. which took a while to arrive. By the time they got to the table (10:30ish), everyone was so hungry I think anything would have been delicious. To be fair, I think the appetizers were all quite nicely done -- decent portions and flavorful. Poutine were amazing. There was a problem with someone not getting their salad and instead of apologizing and getting the salad for them, the server made some excuses about how it was ordered as a second course, blah blah blah, and basically made her feel like it was her fault. Not good service. Entrees were okay, nothing special. Appetizers were just as good or better. The salad I mentioned above? They forgot it until reminded again. It was the last item out (other than the desserts) and unfortunately, the lettuce was old with black spots and edges. Really, really unappetizing! We did bring up these issues to the manager. He apologized and offered free dessert.. which was nice, but most of us weren't hungry by that point anyway. We got three desserts to split between ten people.. and they were pretty good, especially the donuts. The donuts were sprinkled with crack or something equally delicious. I can't say I would go again. Too pretentious, too loud, too dismissive. We don't mind paying premium prices but we do expect the level of service to match the price.

LOVE this place. Went there the first time cause we couldn't score a table at Mozza and in the end was glad how things turned out. My buddy is the sous chef at Palate in Glendale so he knew what was up with the menu and the 3 of us came together to order about 8-9 total plates, from small appetizer sized dishes to a some great main courses. Most everything was fantastic and there was so much variety in the types of food we got. I'd recommend some dishes but they change their menu every couple of weeks so just go in there and check out what they got!

Decadent. The foie gras, biscuit, w/ maple sausage gravy, Holy Moly this is seriously AMAZING. Very rich. Pork Belly Sliders, hello! SO good. Bone Marrow w/ Chimichurri, I wanted this to be amazing, but it was just good. I feel the sauce overpowers the bone marrow. I'd still get it again though. very tasty. I took everyone's advice and got the Ox Tail Gravy Poutine, but honestly, unless you are going there to just grab some beers and share some fries, I'd say skip it. It's a large portion of fries, save the stomach space for the other stuff. I wish you cold just order the Salt + Pepper ice cream that comes w/ the chocolate maple bar. There is nutella powder on it! Can't wait to try Son of a Gun

Now I know why Animal is the place to go in LA: the pork belly sliders!!  I really thought the food would be overhyped, but it really was the best pork belly I've had that I can remember.  Since H. and I were celebrating my entrance to a new decade, we ordered a lot - other favorites were the chicken liver and the bacon chocolate crunch bar.  It was the perfect way to finish off the meal. The foie gras on the biscuit was too sweet for me (although I love sweet and savory normally!) and the oxtail over fries was a little too rich.  I think it would have tasted better if we hadn't had all the other rich foods.  The pig ears wasn't very different from the Chinese appetizer. Overall it was a great eating experience, but I would warn that dishes came out at a VERY slow pace for us on a busy Wed. night.  Keep that in mind if you order a lot!  Definitely worth trying for a special meal.

Spectacular meal. While it can be difficult to get reservations at a decent hour on a weekend night, I called a few days in advance and landed a 9pm on Sunday. My one major complaint about the experience was that we waited a half hour for our table and the hostess was a bit pushy in trying to get us to order drinks before we even sat down. What makes Animal a 4-star spot to me was how unbelievable our dishes were. Literally everything was delicious. Our server was friendly and helpful, advising us to get 6-8 dishes since there were 4 of us (we got 7). Standouts were the bbq pork belly sandwiches, hamachi tostada, and that DAMN foie gras biscuit and maple sausage gravy, which will haunt my tastebuds until my dying day. Vegetarians don't bother.

A non-foodie, first-timers guide to Animal. 1. Don't eat for many hours before you go 2. Don't be afraid 3. "melted petit basgue" = melted cheese on toast 4. "poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar" = chili cheese fries 5. "hamachi tostada" = fish tacos 6. everything is worth trying 7. Animal = excellent! 8. You won't be able to eat for many hours after you go ENJOY, a more unique eating experience will be hard to come by.

My trip to Animal in LA was a culinary adventure! First thing's first, MAKE A RESERVATION! Animal was a great place for food!  My first interaction with the place, the hostess seemed condescending. I stopped in to a restaurant with no sign, and saw a half dozen tables open. I asked for a table for four, and she asked if I had a reservation. I was told they had no tables available, and asked to put my name in. She reassured me there was no possible way I was getting a table, at all, without a reservation. Okay, far enough, I understand, great restaurant, lots of reservations, but basically refusing me service... is a -1 star. That out of the way, I guess in the past two to three years I've become a "foodie", whatever that means. I just love great food, of all kinds, and enjoy finding new and exciting restaurants. Animal is near the top of my list of exciting, great food. The menu is daunting if you're new, but don't be afraid to ask questions. Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable of the food, as well as the drinks menu. I recommend going with friends your first time, as you'll get to try a variety of dishes! They're all small, tapas style dishes. I loved: The BBQ Pork Belly sandwiches (AMAZING! MUST HAVE!) The sweetbreads (MUST HAVE, my first time, loved it) Melted Petit Basque with Chorizo I liked a lot: The Foie Gras over biscuit with gravy Crispy Rabbit Legs Overall, Animal is a great experience. I was able to try a lot of new items, prepared very well, and I enjoyed my "food adventure" there.

I don't really get what is so great about this place.  I love meat and with a passion at that, but Animal did not wow me at all.  My girlfriend and I went because we have some friends go and they loved it.  It wasn't a memorable experience.  I didn't think food was awful, just average.  I had high hopes coming in, but those were deflated once the entrees came.  I did enjoy their selections of beer/wine though. As far as decor, I like the interior.  It reminded me of those quaint NYC bars with the dim-lighting and rustic feel to it.   I may try Animal again, but the money I paid was not worth it.

My husband and I went through: BBQ pork belly sandwiches (I thought they were fantastic, he disagreed, but I love pork belly and he doesn't, they are a bit too saucy though) baby broccoli with pancetta (good but entirely skippable) poutine with oxtail gravy (delicious though not authentic) and foie gras with biscuit and maple gravy (this is a MUST-get if you like foie gras, don't let the price tag dissuade you) for appetizers and flat iron steak (perfectly cooked, smallish portion but excellent) for entree AND tres leches (probably best I've had at a restaurant, but mine is still better) for dessert. Yeah, we pigged out. Obviously these guys know how to cook meat and foie gras and I definitely see Au Pied du Cochon influence, which is always a good thing! I wasn't blown away like I was at Au Pied du Cochon but it was a GREAT dinner and I'd return in a heartbeat. Good, attentive service and excellent wine list (those who are complaining about wine markup here, well, let's say they haven't been to too many fine dining spots. Their wine list is totally reasonable.) I would really love to try their foie gras loco moco next though my husband simply can't seem to grasp the concept of spam and foie gras together and WILL refuse to order it. And the donuts, can't forget the donuts. This is a spot for total carnivores who are seeking excess and decadence in their food and yes, it will hit your spot.

We received a gift certificate to Animal as a wedding gift.  What a thoughtful and delicious wedding gift it was!  There are many reviews here to tell you all about Animal, so here's a short-and-sweet paragraph on my impressions: It was smaller than I expected it to be.   The flat-iron steak had me dancing on the ceiling, it was so good. The kale salad was so salty I ended up with feet the size of balloons.  I should have sent it back, and I'm not sure why I didn't. It was far less expensive than I thought it would be.  We ended up with $15 left over, which we would have gladly given to the lovely pan handler that set up outside of Canter's, but we feared they would not serve him. Would definitely go again!

Probably my MOST memorable meal of 2009. chicken liver toast -$3 (slammin') pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg -$10 (reminds me of "porky" calamari) grilled squid, chorizo, chimichurri - $12 (as fresh as it gets and  w/ a mexican twist - incredible) flat iron, artichoke hash, truffle parmesan fondue -$25 (worth every penny) foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger - $35 (brilliant / delicious)   C'mon now , SPAM & FOIS GRAS ... together in the same recipe?!  It's like a reflection of the man I was, and the man I want to be all in one glorious plate of food.  Where else in the world am I gonna find something that speaks to me like that? This was  dinner for 2 w/ lots of leftovers. My Advice:  Bring a bunch of friends and do it family style.  There's a ton of stuff on the menu that I didn't get to try that I'm gonna have to go back for at some point.

Art imitates food here at Animal. What arrived as small dishes of miniature towers exploded with notes of varying flavors. Harmony in my mouth. We tried three dished (can't remember the names) and they were to do die for. A major plus was the staff. They were sooo enthusiatic about the dishes even I became excited just waiting for them. Nothing beats a happy waiter. Will definitely come back here again and again and again!

Went here with a friend of mine while I was visiting LA. A bunch of my foodie friends back here in Boston said i just HAD to go. Let me tell you they did not disappoint. This place is small so you need to make a reservation. Though we didn't have one luckily we showed up just as they were opening for dinner were able to snag two of the very limited bar seats. The bar tender was great with describing everything on the menu and suggested an excellent weifse beer. (they served it in a glass a little hardly bigger than a shot glass! weird but I'm ok with it) We picked several things to share and eagerly awaited. First was BBQ pork belly sandwich. Fatty, tasty and delicious. I'm a sucker for sweet breads and theirs came with meyer lemon creamy spinach and oyster mushrooms. Perfection! But what really topped it off was the Seared Foie with biscuits and sausage gravy. Words can not describe this dish you'll simply need to taste it your self. Unfortunatly neither of us had room for dessert but I've heard excellent things. This place is great for catching up with an old friend or an intimate date with that special someone. Wish I lived closer!

The servers at Animal are awesome! Four stars for the service. The place was all booked but two friends from out of town flew in to eat here and the maitre'd went out of their way to try and seat us. The food was delicious, creative, delicious and beautiful rendition of random animal parts (sweet breads, marrow, brain!).  Definitely not for the faint of heart, but if you like to experIment new dishes, this place is for you.

Awesome.  Wife took me last night for my b-day pig out. Vibe is somewhat Brooklyn and part LA.  We had a few drinks at the bar and were seated within a few minutes of our reso time. Started off with chicken liver toast and the kale dish.  Both were good. Things picked up once the pork belly sliders arrived.  They were gone in no time and we savored every bite.   Next up was the foi gras with gravy/bisquet.  Awesome.  So rich and flavorful yet not overwhelming. Finished off with the best tres leches I've ever had.   Don't forget the very top of the wine list where you'll find a $20 bottle of house cab!

I really wanted to love everything about Animal, but I ended up only teetering towards "really liking" it. 3.5 stars, perhaps? Amazing vibe, pretty people, buzzing atmosphere, but horrible acoustics so you have to scream so the person sitting two feet across the table from you can hear you. Big minus. Love noise, but really dislike unnecessary, unfiltered noise that could be solved with better building mechanics. Please get Nate Berkus into Animal immediately. The wine list is actually impressive and really affordable bottle prices. As for the food....I will never like chicken liver, or liver of any kind for that matter, so that plate was a miss for me from the moment it was ordered. The maple stuff on top of it just added to its cat food texture. Vom. The broccoli with the panchetta was heavenly. Could have eaten 3 plates of that alone! There are only a handful of plates with vegetables present, so this would be the one to go for. The pork loin sliders were insane--tender, the sauce was the perfect mix of savory and sweet...again, could have eaten many more of these :) Please develop a White Castle equivalent (sans square patty) and I will be the first in line. The doughnuts and chocolate-hazelenut Snickers-type desserts were delish and the perfect finish. This is a vegetarian's hell, so it's truly a venue for the carnivores at heart. And for the true carnivore, there are many other venues to get your beef on.

Chocolate Bacon Bar - WOW - this alone deserves five stars! I am addicted to the show "The Best Thing I Ever Ate," and they did a special on bacon, or maybe sweets, but one of their shows featured this Chocolate Bacon Bar from Animal and I knew I had to have it. I've heard of the chocolate bacon combo before and haven't tried it but the decadence of this bar has made me a believer!! I didn't get the opportunity to go to the actual restaurant and try their other dishes but a friend was kind enough to bring me back this little piece of heaven. The chocolate portion isn't too sweet that it will feel like its stuck in your throat despite its overwhelming layers of rich chocolate, hazelnut paste, and ganache with roasted peanuts all topped with crisp smoky bacon pieces. The salty bacon counterbalances the sweet smoothness of the chocolate that will surely intrigue your palette. My friend sliced up some strawberries on the side and that also complimented the Chocolate Bacon Bar. This is a must try!! I'm looking forward to getting off my crutches and being able to try this restaurant and its impressive menu.

Came here last night for a business dinner. We were seated promptly despite missing our reservation time due to traffic (gotta love LA...) and the lack of valet (only one guy working...sad) To start we began with the following small plates: + lamb meatballs - VERY TENDER and literally falls apart in your mouth. Served with some sort of vegetable and grain (dimly lit setting, it was hard to see!) which lightened up the whole dish. Nice flavor, but ultimately can't beat the lamb meatballs offered by Rustic Canyon. + shaved french melon, muscat, lime - very refreshing and light! A must order if you're planning on having heavier items on the menu. + marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions - DELICIOUS! If you've never had marrow bone before, you should DEFINITELY order it here. It's served with toast points to soak up all that great meat jelly and chimichurri sauce. The sauce added a nice depth and range of flavor, giving off a great contrast to the salty meat taste. Highly recommend. +/- BBQ pork belly sandwiches (2 sliders)- I liked the pork belly, it's got a nice smoke on it without being overwhelming. I didn't care for the sauce, a little too sweet for me and honestly, could have done without it. I would have liked the bun to hold up a little more and be more toasted to contrast with the tenderness of the meat. + melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread - OMG, totally not what I expected, but it's nice and easy to share. Thinly sliced chorizo throughout the melted basque. Grilled bread added crunch and balanced out the saltiness of the chorizo and could hold up the melted basque. +/- sweetbreads, creamed spinach, capers, oyster mushroom - my first experience with sweetbreads. I didn't manage to capture any of the capers but the oyster mushrooms were a great match up with the sweet breads which were breaded and lightly fried. The texture is...interesting, kind of elastic but still tender. Creamed Spinach tied it all together. I'd try it again for kicks and giggles, but it's very rich. I probably couldn't eat a whole plate by myself. Dare to order. For dinner I ordered the Loco Moco... ...foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger - talk about a protein overload. Sooo wrong, yet sooo right. First experience with Foie Gras and it was fabulous - nice sized portion and super tender. Like butter!  Spam added sweetness to the dish, while the hamburger (super tender!!!) was perfectly moist. Served on a small bed of rice and then drowned in the ensuing sauces...which I felt there was just WAAAY too much of. Also tried a bit of the Flat Iron Steak - the truffle fondue is heavenly!!!! For Dessert: + tres leches cake - best tres leches cake I've ever had!!! Sweet, but not too sweet and not overly drenched and dripping in tres leche or soggy. Nice way to end the meal, but I felt it was best eaten alongside... +bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise saw this featured on the foodnetwork and it was a MUST try. It's not as bacony as one might think. The almond layer makes it difficult for you to feel out if you're crunching on almonds or bacon bits. Dark chocolate, not too decadent. Served chilled. Overall - * the space is a lot small than I had anticipated * decor is simple and classy and not at all animalistic, as anticipated * music is very loud * there is no signage outside!!! make sure you write down the address number! * come here if you are adventurous and a carnivore. Very limited vegetarian and fish options * fitting for a small group (5 at most) or less, no picky eaters! * a must try!

Very inventive, well sourced and expertly prepared food.  The service is friendly and helpful. This place is a true treat.  It is small and hard to get into but worth the battle.  Not a regular place for us because it is heavy but highly recommended for anyone who loves meat or any of your foodie friends.

I'm still full. This place is amazing. Unfortunately, however, I got a little over zealous with the apps that I hardly got to finish my entree. We got the asparagus with poached egg and shaved truffles, the pork belly, and the petite Basque cheese melted over Fra' Mani chorizo with toasts of garlic bread. And THEN we had our main meal- my boyfriend had the pork chop, which, though delicious, we couldn't help but compare to SF's NoPa (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) pork chop that's pure perfection. And I had the fried quail on top of grits and greens. The quail was good, though boney and hard to eat- but I know, that's the nature of the beast, i mean bird. I really wanted to have the chocolate and bacon bar for dessert but there was seriously NO room at the end. All the more reason to return though!

How does one go from just having a few glasses of wine to a large check?  Easy, go to Animal.  This is exactly what the beau and I did one Friday night. We had just finished a concert and decided to grab a few drinks.  To accompany our drinks we decided to order a few things.  First on the list was chicken liver toast.  At $3, this may be the best fine dining deal in town and mighty tasty at the same time.  Next, we had the fluke with grape and yuzu granita, apple, orange, serrano (only had a few slices), and mint.  The fluke is nicely cut, no connective tissue here.  For a vegetable we had the broccoli; as we ate this dish we briefly pondered becoming vegetarians.  I mean, if all vegetables were this tasty, it might be easy.  Or, maybe we were tricked by the addition of pancetta and egg to this dish.   For dessert we had the panna cotta with passion fruit.  This dessert was light and creamy, the passion fruit added a little acid to balance out the perfect sweetness of this dessert. Oh, and the wine was good with much more interesting choices on the list than the las time we were here. The bill may have been surprising for just a "few glasses of wine" but it felt well worth it while we were dining on the various small plates at Animal.

I'd been wanting to try out Animal for a while and finally went last night.  Upon arrival, I was informed that the restaurant lost my reservation. No bueno.  The hostess, instead of apologizing, offered us a table but told us we had to rush and leave in an hour and 15 minutes.  I HATE HATE HATE being rushed through dinner.  I realize it's a bad situation and she was trying to somewhat be helpful, but the rushing comment really taints the whole experience. Even still, I tried to shake it off. The waiter failed in guiding us through the menu.  we asked him to help us, and he pointed us to foods that were very rich.  we didn't finish 3 of our last 4 plates.  We were waaaay to stuffed for dessert even though we told the waiter we wanted to save room for dessert.  fail on his part. Also, if you want bread with your meal, watch out, they give it to you, but they charge you for it at the end. Things that were good:  The Lambrusco, the Poutine, the spare ribs, the hamachi tostada.

Just didn't get it...Pork Belly sandwich made me feel like I was eating exactly what it was, a stomach, except covered in sauce. I've never had pork belly before so maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea? Also tried the cavatelli but swore they spilled a container of salt on it, had to send it back, the Chef agreed. Reason for three stars and not two- redeeming hamachi dish, but still nothing out of this world. Server was friendly & helpful, prices reasonable, but I wouldn't go back. Restaurant was cold & unemotional w/ animal skulls on wall, another trendy joint..

This place reminds me of NYC bar/restaurant scene except for the full bar. Everywhere in NY has a full bar and this place only serves beer and wine. Good choices though. Food takes center stage here - decor is sparse but comfortable. No art, elegant lighting. Don't come here and expect to just order dinner and visit with your friends because all converstaions will turn to the food once the courses start coming. The small kitchen serves things as they come out, so not all appetizers / entrees come out together. We were happy to order lots and share everything...it's the best way to eat! So much fun.  This place is for serious eaters, and not appropriate for kids. We had four in our group and tried nearly everything...and I mean literally. For starters, we had: king crab newburg house smoked pork belly foie gras melted petit basque, chorizo poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar main corses: grilled pork chop flat iron loco moco balsamic pork ribs desserts: tres leches pound cake bacon chocolate crunch bar donuts The portions are good - well plated and unique. The ribs are rediculous...there are so many it looks like the Flintstones dinner coming out on two plates! Everything had great sauces and unique flavor and presentation. The pork chop was one of the juciest I've had. The loco moco is just ridiculous - totally amazing. There is so much flavor and richness in these dishes that it may overwhelm you. Donuts were out of this world, and the bacon chocolate crunch bar was unique and totally yummy. Certainly don't come here and skip dessert, even if you're full.  Pace yourself and take stuff to go! Our waiter was exceptional and made it a fun experience. He was very knowledgeable and had a fun, everpresent--yet not overbearing--service style.  His service made all the difference. I wasn't sure what to expect from the website but the experience was very cool. I can't wait to go back, but my tummy needs to wait a bit...

Uhhhh, YUM!   Although I do not remember how my dear Cindy and I happened upon this easy-to-pass-by restaurant, we were fortunate enough to feast there one Friday night.   As we waited for seating on the tiny outdoor patio, we treated ourselves to deliciously smoky glasses of red wine.  We drooled slightly as we watched other patrons served their fare. Once seated we drooled a bit more heavily over the menu.  We both decided on salads which were out of this world.  Then...the meat.  The glorious, glorious meat.  Oh how we behaved like gluttons as we inhaled pork-belly sliders, chorizo dip, and flat iron steak.  It was all heavenly...cooked just right where you only had to chew if you really, really wanted to.  We didn't. As we fell into a meat stupor, I cannot remember whether we had dessert.  I will definitely return for Round 2. If you like meat, eat Animal.

So, I came here, like most for the bacon chocolate crunch bar, which was VERY good might I add. But ... everything else ... amazing too! I liked the relaxed vibe (we went a little earlier to beat the crowds). Here were my favorites: barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg balsamic pork ribs, cherry heirloom tomato panzanella melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac Note to self:  the food is extremely rich - so keep that in mind.

If it's atmosphere you're after, don't come here...If it's a phenomenal culinary experience with which to impress your fellow diners, inciting oohs and aahs with each plate of offal you order and greedily consumer and each new mystifying pairing you gorge on...then come to Animal...NOW. No, there is no romance here whatsoever, it's a straight edge unadorned beer and wine establishment that serves up uber-creative fare that is so beyond worth it I don't even want to tell you about it should you decide to drop everything and go snag one of their few tables. The culinary offspring of 2 semi-chef-ebrities, (they also own Son of a Gun), Animal is the US's equivalent to St. John's of Spittlefield in the UK--it's your quintessential head to tail establishment and the revolving menu showcases this each and every day. There are some staples that seem never to change (thank goodness) including the burrata with tomatillo salsa, that is one of the oddest pairings I've ever had (a lover of burrata I usually enjoy it with sea salt, olive oil, perhaps some honey, etc but no)--this is almost like cheese and guacamole in a really really good way...trust. Their most popular dish, so said our waiter, is the foie gras and a biscuit in maple sausage gravy. It's to die for. And no, this ain't no normal biscuit...it's more like a delicately fried amalgam of grits perhaps...again...trust, for I cannot adequately explain these off-kilter dishes without copping to telling you to just GO. The quail too, while a bit small, is utterly orgasmic and I had to stop myself from licking the plate. They do offer a fish or two and I was lucky enough to have a perfectly grilled piece of snapper. The chicken liver toast was the last order I could shove down my pig-shy dining partner....I cannot wait to go back for the pork belly sandwiches, pig tails if they have them, veal brains...mmmm I could go on forever. It's truly an experience, and is definitely one worth having even with the zillions of other options out there. Next up, son of a gun. (A few tips: parking spots are all over the place, just give yourself a few extra minutes to circle the block if you must. There is absolutely no sign on the door....so know that address my friends. The carafes of vino are a bit on the small side unless your server has a generous pour so I'd opt for the bottle if you're committed. Lastly, they may tell you to go for 2 plates each--if you're hungry (and lord knows come dinner time I can usually eat my own arm off), you should go for 5-6 for two people. Come on, live a little, and try a lot.)

My husband and I have seriously EATEN our way through the Animal menu, ever since our first visit in August. Each week we try to bring new friends with us to enjoy the great food and fun atmosphere. We've loved everything and our two CURRENT favorites (the menu changes regularly) are the "Flat Iron Steak, PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon) Fondue & Cauliflower" and the "Foie Gras on Biscuits and Gravy". Chefs Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo came to our table each visit to chat about the food. Really nice guys that put a lot of love into each dish. Update: 3/30/09 The Foie Gras Loco Moco is AWESOME!

Combined four trips here between the two of us. Animal has a lot of heart and uses top ingredients but really doesn't rise above good home cooking. At their prices, it doesn't compute. I suppose if you don't cook, Animal (and other tasty but rustic places like Gjelina) might seem incredible. Most of their dishes have that destination restaurant patina to them - finished with some type of gastrique (sweet/sour taste), fat and salt to give each bite that big, big flavor. Sure, their pork belly app is quite tasty. A bacon, asparagus and turkey egg app is classic but a no brainer. A blood orange and olive app is kind of a joke. Of all the entrees, the foie loco moco gets a lot of attention. Ya, it's very tasty, a mess of plate that you scoop up (as it should be). But, it's just not that interesting or sophisticated for all the hype and the price. The room is super noisy, which adds to the bustling sense, but truthfully they should add some more baffling. Service is good, but tends to wane as the meal goes on - unless you're Jeffrey Steingarten sitting at the next table.

I've heard a lot of good things about this place, but I also heard some bad things about it. My experience with Animal Restaurant was simply exquisite. The place has a casual relaxing atmosphere, with friendly, attentive, helpful services. All the dishes are cooked to perfection. Nothing more and nothing less. Simply perfect. 5 of us shared 5 appetizers, 2 large entrees, 2 bottles of Pinot Noir and 1 Bacon chocolate bar, and we only have to pay $50 per person. You can't get better deal than this. It's definitely a great place to have a great meal with great group of friends, so you can share all their goodies. If you are watching your cholesterol, trying to diet or a health conscious, this is NOT a place for you. If you just want to enjoy great food and friendly casual atmosphere, this is DEFINITELY A PERFECT PLACE for you.

At first glance, the restaurant, with no sign on the front and a small space for such a hip place may make you wonder if it's just a hipster hang out without the goods to back it up. Upon entering the wooded space, with wood tables, and lighting that isn't too bright but isn't too dim, you will soon discover that not only are your eyes and ears in for a treat but so are your taste buds. With a menu that changes weekly, if not sometimes daily, and a tapas style selection of h'deovures, this place will have you constantly guessing. Be adventurous because everything here is exciting and interesting. Go with a group of friends or your lover but let them know that they have to be up for anything. Blind fold them if you have to! With delicacies in the making, the food here will have you turning into a tiger, growling with satisfaction at the array of dishes. The poutine (a fancy word for french fries) with a decadent meat gravy sauce is so fantastic you may ask for seconds. They have a delicious summer salad with yellow tomatoes, basil and a superb balsamic vinaigrette that will revive and refresh your tongue. Save room for dessert because their snickers and dark chocolate bars with bacon on top sounds bizarre and close to disgusting but is rich, flavorful and fantastic. With a full selection of wines and beers, that also change frequently, and a knowledgeable staff, four h'douvres later and 2 desserts with a perfect bottle of wine and you may never leave.

Tried Animal last night. We eagerly anticipating the meal/experience as the restaurant had been highly recommended. Honestly, neither my girlfriend nor I were impressed. The service was fine, not exceptional, but the food was fairly uninspiring. And the ambiance, OK if you like an environment so loud you can't carry on a conversation. The place was simply way too loud. Had the shoulder steak, very tough and too much grizzle. Had the curried shrimp with bacon as well, liked the shrimp and the bacon was great but they were paired with a sweet tangy creme fraiche sauce with black eye peas. Beans and shrimp do not make a good combination. The foie gras biscuit was good, as was the grilled squid and chorizo, though the amount of chorizo was minuscule. Overall, I didn't find the food or atmosphere impressive at all. Really have no interest in going back as I can get much better food and atmosphere elsewhere.

Animal is a pork lovers dream. If you love meat and you should than you need to head over to Animal on Fairfax. Yes its small and the wait is long but once you take your first bit of what ever animal you ordered you'll see what the fuss is all about. Its wonderful cuts of pork and beef that is prepared simply but perfectly. There isn't a bunch of froo froo sauce or fancy ingredients just great meat cooked just right. I had the barbecue pork belly sandwich. Tender flaky pork belly with the right amount of fat mixed with the right amount of sweet and tangy BBQ sauce. I started with a tomato salad that almost made me cry. My friend had the flat iron steak which was done just right and seasoned exactly what a good steak should be seasoned with...Koser salt and fresh pepper. The memories still linger till this day. The smells, the taste, the Animal.

W went here last week after hearing a lot of great things.  Got a bunch of the small plates to share among the group and would reccomend that since there are so many great things to try. Its a tiny place with minimalist decor. (Goat skull skeletons hang on the walls- Hello, we are not at Outback Steakhouse anymore....) The great and powerful Oz of the place, the hostess, was only mildly pretentious. Refreshing in LA. Foie Gras on a biscuit with sausage gravy: I really dont like Foie, but this was fantastic. Super rich but a must try. A great biscuit topped with a chunk of foie and covered in a cream based sausage gravy. Chorizo/cheese bake with toast: Amazing. Really thick cut chorizo with melted cheese. Tasted like there was some truffle oil or somemthing in there but we could not quite figure out what it was. I would make out with this dish. Just saying. Pork Belly Sliders- Really good, a little greasy. Pork Ear- ahhh! Pork EAR? Yeah, I know. But its good (and salty- beware). They slow cook it then cut it in to thin strips and fry it. Anything fried is obviously instantly amazing. Quail Fry- Pretty decent but I am not a huge fan of the raw runny egg Chocolate/bacon torte cake: Chocolate and bacon- together at last. Ultra rich. The flavors went surprisingly well together since the bacon was chopped and well cooked. Ricotta pound cake with cream and strawberried: So good. Pound cake was surprisingly light and fluffy with fresh whipped cream and berries. Awesome way to end the meal.

Randomly came across this place on a Thursday night and was pleasantly surprised.  There's no sign saying "Animal" so I didn't even know the name of the place until we were seated and I looked at their menu.  It's a small and unassuming place that serves great wines and tapas.  I had chicken hearts and they were delicious!!!!  And I guess it must be a trendy spot since my friend and I spotted a celeb there too.  I just think it's funny that on Yelp it's labeled as a hipster place.

"Diamonds are a girls best friend." True statement by Marilyn Monroe. But, "Foie Gras is a girls gay best friend" - controversial yet oh so fabulous!! The foie gras dishes at Animal are the stand outs on the menu. To die for: 1. Foie Gras Loco Moco: My fav dish at Animal! Who can say no to foie gras, spam, hamburger and quail egg?? Enough said. 2. Foie Gras Maple Sausage Gravy and Biscuit: Delicious. The maple sausage gravy was sweet yet savory. The biscuit was buttery and was the perfect accompaniment to the foie gras. 4. BBQ Pork Belly Sliders: perfectly cooked pork belly; kind of crispy on the outside and soft fatty inside. The slaw provided a nice crunch and coolness. The brioche bun was super soft and was the perfect ratio of bun to pork belly to slaw. 4. Bone marrow with chimichurri: Huge bone filled with marrow. The chimichurri was delicious and went well with the marrow, however, it did kind of overpower the marrow just a bit. But good flavors overall. 4. Lamb neck, nettle, fava bean, daikon, black vinegar jus: Very tender pieces of meat. Loved the fava beans and daikon. Simple dish but complex in flavors and textures. 3. Veal brains, vadouvan, apple sauce, carrot: I was a bit wary of trying this dish but it smelled so good that I had to try it. The veal brains were lightly battered and fried...so good and super creamy. Vadouvan is a spice, much like curry, and that was a great way to tie the ingredients together. It was a bit spicy so the apple sauce cooled the palette.  Good dish if you want to be adventurous. 5. Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar: Super decadent but I couldn't really taste the bacon.  I don't think it was worth $7...I would much rather have the Tres Leche. 6. Tres Leche Cake: Loved this dessert soo so much! It was very moist almost had a melt in your mouth milky consistency. The dulce de leche at the bottom of the cake was amazing as well, but I wish there was more of it! 7. House Cabernet: $20/bottle...good to me. Mild yet flavorful. Paired nicely with the dishes above. Live without: Absolutely nothing. Great dining experience from the service, food and simple venue.

A fun place for carnivores  to try different animal body parts!   I would definitely recommend you going with a group of friends so you can order a lot of dishes. Generally, the dishes are a bit heavy and saucy, so it's not something you want to have everyday. Overall, I enjoyed the experience and the concept. The dishes we had in the order of preference. 1.  BBQ Pork Belly Sandwich - fatty but yummy 2.  Ricotta Ravioli - I think this was the lightest dish we had, and  a good contrast from the other fattier foods. It's nothing special but definitely added variety to all the heavy dishes we had. 3. Chicken Liver Toast - rich and creamy. 4. Hamachi Tostada - spicy & citrusy. It was pretty refreshing since it's not as salty as the other dishes. 5. Pig Ear - slightly crunchy. I can't believe I ate pig ears and actually       enjoyed the dish. I guess its all about the texture! (My relatives eat pig ears in Chinese restaurants..I usually just don't eat them because they are brown colored and just don't look appetizing.) haha 6. Bone Marrow - thought it had too much chimichurri sauce...very greasy but flavorful 7. Poutine (fries) - this was pretty salty, but only had a small portion so it was decent. 8.  Balsamic Pork Ribs - think this was just okay...but it was over-shadowed by other dishes. Service was great! The staff was very friendly and attentive.  Reservations for larger crowds are still hard to get so book for in advance!

After going through a bunch of recommendations from one of my local LA friends, he finally suggested I try Animal and after spending 3 seconds looking at the menu I knew this was our place.  Animal is easily the best and most interesting dinner restaurant I've ever been to in LA.  We had a group of 4, and got to try: - BBQ Pork Belly Sandwich (Amazing) - Pig Ears with chili, lime, and fried egg - Rabbit Loin - Hamachi Tostada - Smoked Trout Salad - Poutine with Oxtail gravy and Vermont Cheddar (Wow!) - Foie Gras biscuit with maple sausage gravy - Melted Petit basque with chorizo (essentially chorizo slices topped with a cheese wheel and then baked) - Sticky Toffee Pudding - Tres Leches - Bacon chocolate crunch bar Lots of small dishes, and I wasn't even close to being so full that I hated myself. Also, they have a really solid wine list available by the glass, carafe, or bottle.  No matter which portion you want, they'll take care of you! Get a group here and go crazy.  I already want to come back.  $200 for 4 people including dessert and wine.

Atmosphere: Always seems busy. Very minimalist. Service: Waiters know how to translate unknown items on the menu into something you're more familiar with. Good with suggestions as well. Food: Excellent. Pig ears. Poutine. Rabbit. Price: Fairly pricey, but worth it. Would I go back? Yes.

Wonderful experience overall. Not as raw and rustic as I thought it would be after reading this spring's New Yorker profile.  More composed and sleek.  The kitsch of the restaurant's name even feels misleading--it's hard to find on the exterior. Everything I tasted was fantastic--I loved the foie gras and biscuit, sweetbreads, and oxtail poutine in particular.  I feel like I experienced every sensation between sweet and savory, crisp and melty.  We reveled in the beer selection and the house wine. I took issue only with the philosophy of "we would like you to order all at once, share plates, and accept dishes in the order in which we choose to send them."  I can't help but find this either fussy or lazy at any restaurant.  Our server's audible sigh notwithstanding, our request to order a plate to share while we decided on plates to claim as our own was honored.  And the meal was lovely. If anything, the experience needed something else.  More animal skulls on the wall?  Complimentary homemade bread with lardo? I'd like to update this after the next time, because ultimately, I do plan to go back.  Really interesting food.

We ordered a salad dish  that I can't remember, the hamachi, quail, pig tails, pork belly sliders... Thumbs up for the pork belly sliders - really soft juicy fatty tasty pork belly pieces. These were my favorite. As for the "pig tails" - thick chewy skin and flesh that tasted like duck, with small bones on the inside and I am not sure I liked the spicy buffalo wings & ranch sauces that came with these...  I would've ordered the "pig ears" too (yes, I love pork) but images of the pig ears they sell at the local pet store kept popping into my mind... Overall, this was a pleasant dining experience but I am in no hurry to go back. I can get good meat elsewhere and for less $.

I'll just cut to the chase. This is what we ordered, and there was no disappointment. Well, there was one very disturbing issue. THEY DON'T HAVE THE DONUTS ANYMORE!!!! The waiter said the chef was not happy with the inconsistency of the donuts, so he took it off the menu. WTF! But it is this behavior that makes the food here incredible, so I guess it is a double edged sword. I recommend dining family style. Anyways, so down to the nitty gritty. The waiter was very friendly and helpful, especially with the wine selection.  He let us taste some selections, until we decided on the red wine cuvee. The Foie Gras, Biscuit, Maple Sausage Gravy! Once again incredible. The Foie Gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger, also incredible. Great lamb neck & goat cheese stuffed pasta, green garlic cream. Lettuces, sumac vinaigrette, beets, avocado, feta, pita For dessert we had; pound cake, strawberries, cream and the panna cotta, blood orange granita.  What a way to top off a great meal.

Excellent place to take a date!  The larger top portion of the menu are smaller dishes and the middle is larger dishes (they're not marked as such).  You'll have fun dismantling the delicious and beautifully presented dishes no matter what you order.  I suggest being adventurous, we ordered some things that we were hesitant about and they turned out to be appetizing and amazing! The "duck confit, apple, pecans, dates, arugula 14" was duck meat with sweet accompaniment. The "foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy 22" was a stack (eggs benedict style) and the biscuit was SO good, probably the best biscuit I've ever had. The "crispy rabbit legs, meyer lemon aioli, peas & their greens 25" was delicious, but a bit small for an "large plate."  After seeing it served to someone else, I would've instead ordered the "rib eye for two, escargot butter, mash, greens mkt price" because it was HUGE, enough probably for 3 or 4 adults. I wasn't a big fan of the chocolate bacon dessert, but my date was.  I eat awesome organic bacon nearly everyday, maybe I was used to it?  Unless you're a big fan of chocolate, I'd try something else. Definitely will go back, perhaps with a larger party as I'm eager to try a variety of dishes!

What a culinary orgasmic experience I had at Animal tonight?  We started with the chicken liver toast which was incredibly good. A perfect start to our meal. Next we had the veal brains which was only so-so. My least favorite of the night. Next were the sweetbreads with creamed spinach. I could have eaten several plates of that. Sooo good. After that was the foie grad with biscuit.  This is to die for. Our waiter suggested it but it was already at the top of our list of things to eat there. Pretty sure I'm gonna be dreaming about that tonight. Then came the bone marrow. My first time trying it and if I had less class and etiquette I would have picked it up with my hands and sucked the marrow out just to make sure I got it all. Delicious. And the toast it comes with is the best toast I ever had. Then we had the rabbit legs. My mom and brother thought it was a tad salty but I thought it was perfection. Our last item were the balsamic ribs. Hands down best ribs I have ever eaten. This is were I forgot my etiquette and started licking my fingers at the table. Absolutely amazing. We ended it with the chocolate bacon bar. Also delicious. Just a perfect meal. One of my all time top five meals. We even arrived 30 minutes late and the hostess held our table for us. We were very grateful cuz it would have been a shame to miss that meal.

THE PIG EAR @ Animal!!!!! This is one of my favorite dishes of all time!  The first time I went to Animal I wasn't an adventitious eater at all. However, once that crispy little pig ear hit my taste buds I was never the same! The dish is served on a bed of crispy thinly sliced pig ear strips.  The strips are covered with scallions and a tangy, slightly spicy chili-lime vinaigrette. The strips are draped with an over-easy fried egg. A quick poke of the fork and the rich yolk is free to mingle with the surprisingly addictive hog meat. YUMMY!!

My favorite restaurant in Los Angeles by far is Animal. I remember seeing the restaurant, along with the owners on NBC program a few years back when it opened. These guys know what they're doing. I ordered the Balsamic Pork Ribs, and the Pork Belly Sliders, and the Tres Leches cake upon my 1st visit, and every item blew me away with AWESOME flavor. My friend ordered the Poutine, ox tail gravy, cheddar and that was good too. If you haven't been here yet.. GO!

This place was practically empty when we arrived for our 9:30 dinner reservation on Sunday. We didn't really even have to call in to reserve a table, there really just wasn't anybody else dining there. It's located on a busy stretch of Fairfax in Mid-City, in a neighborhood that's a little on the dumpier side (dumpy as in overflowing trash on the sidewalk...not where you would feel like you would be the victim of a drive-by shooting at any second). The restaurant has no exterior signage, so I can see how tough it is for first time diners to find the place. Thankfully I had seen photos of Animal's facade on Yelp, so I recognized it immediately. Walking in, I quickly noticed how small the restaurant is. It's not ridiculously tiny, but it can easily be packed with diners within minutes on a busy night. The decor is very minimal, with clean lines, and a "less is more" approach to dining ambience. Me likey. A restaurant's decor shouldn't be busier than the food they're serving. The tapas dishes our group tried: * Pork Belly - Very small and expensive dish, split three ways. The pork belly was great. Loaded with fat, it guaranteed an explosion of flavor with each bite (actually just one bite, because that's the most we got to have - each). * Melted petite basque - The most satisfying of the tapas-style dishes we ordered. The basque was hot and sizzling with slices of chorizo baked into it. Load  that cheesy and meaty mixture up on a slice of the accompanying garlic bread (more like garlic toasts/chips) and you've got yourself one hell of an appetizer. * Some dish that was literally just deep fried corn nuts - Lame. Not worth the money. You can tell how uninspired I think this dish is because I can't even remember what it's called. It literally was just a packet of corn nuts deep fried that was served with a few slices of lime. Salty, bitter, and disappointing. I ordered the flat iron steak as my entree. Eh. It was more or less average. I ordered the steak cooked medium, it came to me medium rare. I just sucked it up and ate it because I never send any food back to the kitchen unless it is either (1) a COMPLETE and embarrassing disaster or (2) if I'm paying an "arm and a leg" prices and it's not exactly the way I want it. The meat was a bit rubbery, hard to cut, and tasted like a steak I could order for $10 at NORMS. The potatoes, bordelaise, and artichoke worked really well on the side. That combination of flavors on the side led me to lick my plate clean. The service was fantastic. Had three different staff members approach us during our meal to ask us how everything was. Our waiter was extremely friendly without "overdoing it." A really odd encounter we had with this place was that a few of the listed menu items were not available when we tried to order them. Found it a little bit strange. It's almost like a tease, and a surprise when you're told "Sorry, we don't have that right now. We ran out." It's a little bit above average in pricing here for the amount of food you get. Between three people, we each ordered an entree and shared three small "tapas" style dishes. Had a glass of wine each (ranged from $7 - $11 a glass) and the total came out to be around $45/person before tip. Although I didn't leave impressed my first time, I definitely would come back just because our waiter informed us that the restaurant's menu is constantly changing because it's all based on what's fresh and new at the Farmer's Market. Throw in the fact that the service and personnel are incredibly friendly, I'd have to say that I'm in!

Great spot, but u need to be a carnivore. We had the sweetbreads, fried livers and a few other things.  The food is very adventerous, but there are things on the menu that are mellow.  The beer is also great, try the old rasputin for a dark fun beer.  Overall I love this place, head across the street to The Dine for a drink. Also my buddy had the bacon chocolate bar and said it was fantastic, but rich.

Wonderful food and experience - looking through the menu is like going on a safari, ready to pick off anything helpless and tasty. We steered clear of the entrees to load up tapas-style, which proved a very wise decision as we got to try a lot. CHICKEN LIVER TOAST: As described, but know it's a good, thick inch of liver on a good, thick inch of toast. MELTED PETIT BASQUE, CHORIZO, GARLIC BREAD: The best! I can still taste it, just perfect, would come back on the strength of this dish alone. SWEETBREADS, CREAMED SPINACH, CAPER BUTTER, PORCINI: Meat prepared well but the dish came off a bit too sour in the end. PORK BELLY, KIMCHI, PEANUTS, CHILI SOY, SCALLION: Pork belly seems to be the new ethnic trendy thing to make in the American restaurants, and no one does it right, including Animal. Kimchi was even worse. QUAIL FRY, GRITS, SLAB BACON, CHARD, MAPLE JUS: Awesome, another home run, although it had a bit of a spiced Popeye's chicken bent to it, which was funny because my friend had earlier in the dinner recounted the experiment of serving the same menu in a downscale cafe versus an upscale restaurant and how customers are willing to pay a lot more for the same food based simply on presentation and fancy wording (melted cheddar, provolone, mozzarella over tortiglioni versus, you know, mac n' cheese). Anywho. LAMB CHOPS, BEETS, CREAMY SUMAC, CHICKPEAS: Also a very satisfying dish, can't go wrong ordering it. BACON CHOCOLATE CRUNCH BAR: So the "crunch" is from the bacon bits layered all over the chocolate bar - pure heaven! The service was excellent, attentive, and they even organized what we'd ordered into three complementary courses. The wine was just okay, especially for the prices. If there had been a little higher success rate with the dishes, this place would definitely be five-star for me, but I'm happy to come back and keep trying.

Very minimalist interior, which is great when you're working with such a small space. We (3 girls) chowed down tonite... -amberjack- ok, bit too saucey -basque- very good -pig ears with egg- good, but a lil too salty -pork shoulders dumplings(?)- very tastey -flat iron- eh, too salty and saucey, potato/veggies overdone -foie gras+spam burger-delicious! fyi-no buns -lamb-smelled and looked delicious-didn't get a chance to try this one. -bacon chocolate bar-eh~ -wine- =) *should have ordered the fish with lobster and corn. Looked delicious. and the ribs instead of the flat iron. FYI-pics are much larger than actual dishes. ie. foie gras with gravy is served on a very small plate. Overall the meats were over powered by all the sauces, which masks the main flavor of the dish. I didn't like this too much. Main entrees are very heavy...watch your cholesterol level here. Bill was ~165 which is not bad for everything we tried. Parking-we were lucky enough to find street parking. Otherwise gotta park at the Canter's diner lot. Location- a couple doors north of Canter's diner. Very easy to miss b/c they don't have a sign that says "Animal" Just a dark board. Look for the blue valet umbrella.

Let me start by saying there's no need to look for the name of this restaurant from the outside.  Just look for the place painted black and that would be Animal. Onto the food!  In no particular order... okay, I lied.  In the order that our food came out: PIG EAR - First time I've had pig ear.  They're chewy and slightly-crispy strips of pig ear that are a bit salty, esp. w/ the chili and lime, but the flavors are balanced out nicely with the egg.  Make sure you pop the yolk and smother your piece of ear with it (that was a weird thing to say).  I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure I would order it again next time; I'd rather try something else on the menu.  (B-) CHICKEN LIVER TOAST - Initially, the taste and texture of the liver was excellent.  Then the actual flavor of the liver started to kick in and I have to say... I'm just not a fan of liver (chicken liver that is; you'll soon see I do love duck/goose liver).  It's the aftertaste.  I guess my palate has some maturing to do.  (C-) PORK BELLY W/ KIMCHI, PEANUTS, CHILI SOY AND SCALLION - If you're Korean, you'll notice right off the bat that this isn't the traditional kimchi your grandma used to make.  The cabbage is cut julienne-style and the flavor is strong in a different way.  I tried it without the pork and it was kickin'.  But eat it with the pork belly and it's just an awesome blend of flavors.  Cooking the pork thoroughly, especially one that thick, without overcooking it was truly impressive.  Crispy on the outside, tender as heck on the inside and just bursting with flavors.  Yeah, I'm a fan.  (A) PORK BELLY SLIDERS - Again, the pork belly was cooked perfectly.  The pork in the slider was even thicker than the one that came on the previous dish, but it was just as tender.  And the flavor from the fat was spectacular.  Mix that with the bun (which was not dry or too bready), the cole slaw (I've been eating a lot of sandwiches lately w/ slaw and it's quickly becoming a necessity in sandwiches for me) and the BBQ sauce (not too strong, sweet or tangy) and you've got a slider that I can eat every day.  (A+) FOIE GRAS, BISCUIT, MAPLE SAUSAGE GRAVY - Okay, I know foie gras is controversial.  Cruel.  Inhumane.  But it's SO good!  The chefs cooked the foie gras to perfection.  It just melts in your mouth.  I mean, you really don't even have to chew it.  In this particular case though, the question I had was: Does this unconventional combination of foie gras with a southern comfort food really work?  In my opinion... yes and no.  No because the breadiness of the biscuit and the over-the-top-sweetness of the gravy takes away from the flavor and essence of the foie gras.  I tried each item separately and I tried them together and I definitely enjoyed the foie gras more on its own.  But the combination also works because well, it just does!  It's DANG GOOD!  (A-) FOIE GRAS LOCO MOCO - Wasn't entirely sure we should get two foie gras dishes but I'm sure glad we did.  This was a triple decker comprised of foie gras, Spam and hamburger.  I tried each on its own and I tried them all together.  And you know what?  I enjoyed them both ways, though when you eat all three together, the sweetness of the foie gras, the saltiness of the Spam and the tenderness or the hamburger all create a harmonious result.  I'd recommend eating it this way.  (A) BACON CHOCOLATE CRUNCH BAR - We only ordered this because my friend had asked me to try it for him.  Sorry to say, this was my least favorite thing of the night.  I thought it would be a strip of bacon covered in chocolate.  Instead, it was a chunk of chocolate w/ some bacon bits sprinkled on the side.  I don't like chocolate to begin with so this really never had a chance.  I think it's highly overrated.  (D) TRES LECHES - Simply put: what a way to end the meal!  Moist, sweet (but not too sweet) and just fantastically delicious.  I couldn't think of a better finish.  You won't regret getting this.  (A) 4 1/2 stars

I had such high hopes for this restaurant. I liked the Two Dudes Catering show the chefs had on Food Network, and thought they had a interesting interpretation of simple, good food. Simple? Yes. Good? Not really. Service was the best part of the meal. People were friendly, informative and kinda cute in their own way. Food: Pork Belly Sliders - probably the best part of the meal. They were tasty crazy delicious. I didn't mind the fat, but I should have for what was going to come. Quail fry with maple jus - fried perfectly, the jus with the parsnips were a great complement! The sauce was pretty rich... Steak with truffle sauce - Too much sauce. Truffle oil overpowered the steak. No balance. Balsamic ribs - Looked like black tar on ribs. I got wasabi nasal burn from the strong balsamic glaze. Halfway through, I started to scrap off the glaze only to discover under the crust a layer of fat that I felt was excessive. It's scary when homeless William can't finish something, and these ribs frightened me. Bacon chocolate hazelnut crunch bar - way too rich, after a meal like that, it was too much... too much!!! Tasted like fat on fat on fat. Think of a melted lindor chocolate with bacon bits on top. I don't think I am coming back. I don't get the hype. It's not that good.

This is an update to my previous review below because I recently went back for dinner this past weekend.  I remember the pork belly sliders being great the first time, but I just didn't remember how great until I tried it again ... this by far is absolutely the BEST pork slider you will ever eat ... it is phenomenal and def memorable!  We also had the pig ears, which I thought was better than the pig ears at lazy ox canteen.  The duck confit was also one of the best duck dishes I've had.  The meat fell of the bone and was cooked and seasoned very well!  Another memorable dish was the foie gras, biscuit, and sausage gravy ... a crazy high end spin on a classic comfort food.  This place makes you unbelievably happy because the food is so great.  I would give it 4.5 stars if possible! This place is awesome! A group of us came here for a late night fourth meal.  This place is open till 2 AM which is perfect for late night meals after going out.  The best thing was the pork belly sliders! yum! The oxtail poutine was good as well, but a bit salty.  Another mediocre thing we got was the bacon chocolate dessert.   Overall a great place to eat, drink wine,  and come late night!

We went to this joint with some friends and fellow yelpers.  Had to try this joint after all the rave reviews.  The decor is minimal.  There's nothing on the walls, no fancy table settings, heck the name of the restaurant is not even on the outside.  I guess its all about the food.  So here goes. Grilled Octopus & Chorizo- It was well cooked but I thought we did not get a lot of octopus for $17. Baby Kale- Very disappointed.  Its just sliced kale and the lemon vinagrette.  Something I could have made. Hamachi Tostada- Nice flavor but again I thought they were a bit cheap on the hamachi. BBQ Pork Belly Sandwich- Absolutely my favorite dish.  Nice big chunk of thick pork belly.... so meaty, so fatty.... tangy bbq sauce.... cole slaw was excellent....a must have.  I would go back just for this dish alone. Bone Marrow Chimichurri- I love bone marrow so you really can't go wrong here but although the chimichurri by itself had really nice flavor I thought it overpowered the bone marrow which is a sin. Melted Basque, Chorizo, & Grilled Bread- Not one of my favorites.  Tasted like cheese and bread. Foie Gras, Biscuit, Maple Gravy- All the components would be great on their own but the maple gravy was really sweet and all together overpowered the taste of the foie..... Poutine & Oxtail-  A fancy way of saying ox tail & gravy over fries.  Nice and savory.  Tasted better than it looked.  One of the dishes that you actually get a lot of food since the restaurant is tapas style, most of the dishes are smaller. Foie Gras Loco Moco- I thought it was good although some at the table really loved it.  I could actually taste each component which is a plus.  I just wonder if a good loco moco really needs any foie. Raddichio Salad- Another disappointment.  Nothing special, not worth it. Flat Iron Steak, Truffle Parmesan Fodue- Cooked perfectly medium rare but I'm not sure about the fondue on top.  I thought it gave the steak a funky flavor.  I would have just preferred the steak on its own. Sticky toffee pudding- Just average. Tres Leches- Very good but it was very sweet. Looking back on the experience there were some really awesome dishes and some big disappointments.  Most everything was well done but I just didn't think all the flavors went together for every dish.

I honestly don't know what vegetarians are doing writing middling to negative reviews for this restaurant. What were they thinking coming to this place? It's called ANIMAL. You can eat pig ears, headcheese and sweetbreads here. Yes, we all love animals, too. Every last piece of them. What I like about this place, aside from the eclectic and richly intense menu, is the fact that it's a mix between an upscale restaurant and a pub. It's a great place for both a one-on-one romantic date or a group gathering. Great for a lot of occasions. It's a bit pricey, but it's well worth it.

What would you expect from a place called Animal? They probably get death threats regularly from vegans and vegetarians.  I look forward to the day I get to visit LA again because of Animal. We foolishy didn't make reservations and waited about 40 minutes or so outside sipping on Coconut Porter served by our hostess.  If you can find Coconut Porter please do try it.  It's only available on the west coast. Here's what we orderd: Fried Pig Ear with Chili, Lime and a Fried Egg - Very good!  Tangy and crispy. Poutine fries with oxtail gravy & cheddar - I've never had fries remain so damn crispy even at the bottom of all that glorious oxtail gravy.  It's a scientific wonderment. Bone marrow with chimichurri and caramelized onions - Need I say more? foie gras terrine, pickled crab apple, black pepper - It was only two of us and I was pretty full from the previous dishes and couldn't enjoy the foie like I wanted to. bacon chocolate bar - We took it to go and had it the next day and it was still good! I wish there was one on the East Coast.

Took kid sis and her fiance here last Monday. My past experience at Animal has been that the apps generally outshine the entrees. So we decided to graze...twas the best move for all involved. The lowdown: pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg (first time for ears and was pleasantly surprised) grilled squid, chorizo, chimichurri (squid was cooked perfectly and the sauce was as well suited as it would have been for a nice piece of carne) sweetbreads, creamed spinach, capers, hen of the woods (perfectly cooked sweetbreads...again) pork belly, kimchi, peanuts, chili soy, scallion (just like bacon butter, I swear) amberjack, nectarine, citrus, mint, chili (very nice for the hot weather, with the right amount of heat) poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar (should be an entree - couldn't stop eating it) foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy (should be outlawed - muy yummy) And two desserts: brown butter berry tart, whipped crème friache (they sure have a way with fresh fruits in pastry dishes) bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise (their classic) Can't wait for my next visit...I'm sold for life

It is always the sign of a good restaurant when there are so many items on the menu that I want to try that I struggle with deciding what to order.  That was the case when we sat down at Animal.  After much debate we settled on the following: Hamachi tostada--very fresh hamachi, great flavors and a good way to balance out some of the heavier dishes of the night bbq pork belly sandwiches--get them...you will not regret it! pork ribs--these were very good and tender with a great tangy bbq sauce and some almond cole slaw that was a perfect match king crab leg with tabasco butter--this was a special and a simple dish but my wife is still talking about it she liked it so much sweetbreads--very generous portion of sweetbreads that were fried to almost the consistency of fried chicken It is true that they want you to order everything at the beginning to make it easier on the kitchen.  When we initially ordered we had also gotten the steak with a fondue sauce.  We had to cancel it because we were too stuffed.  We can both eat a good bit so I don't know what people ordered that they thought the portions were too small but we were more than satisfied with what we got. As for the people who thought it was pretentious, I am not sure why.  Our waiter was very friendly and it was definitely more of a laid back feel then some of the other places in LA.   This is the type of place that I would go regularly to if I lived a bit closer.

Amazing.  I went to Providence the night before, which was refined and beautiful....but Animal packed a PUNCH!  Every bite was so full of flavor!  So thoughtful, so well prepared, sooooooo good!   Pork belly bbq sandwiches were the BEST sandwich I ever ate! OMFG, what?!  Unreal!!! Grilled octopus and chorizo was amazing. Sweetbreads were out of this world amazing.  Adding the capers was brilliant! And foie gras biscuit was great but too rich for my personal taste.  I can see how anyone else would die over it though. The foie, biscuit, and creamy sauce were all masterfully prepared but I just didn't love them all together.  Since foie gras is so fatty and rich on it's own I prefer it paired with something a bit lighter.  Still delish though! And dessert we had chocolate crunch bar -yummmmmmm... and the tres leches- disappointing!  I am a chef myself and sometimes I notice when I order something I've made extremely well I am usually disappointed.  I make a mean tres leches so this one really wasn't very good compared to mine.  Not their fault though. ;)   Great staff too. Lively vibe, cool people. Love this restaurant!!!!!

I couldn't bring myself to give this place a four or more star rating. Maybe I didn't order the right dishes but I thought everything that we did order was just OK. We ordered the kale (which was refreshingly great), baby broccoli (ok) and quail. My problem with the quail is that it was sitting on a bed of yogurt and fresh fruit. The two, to me, do not go together very well. Greek yogurt should be saved for another occasion. Perhaps I should be adventurous in my future orders here but I don't think I'd come back. I also felt like the waitress was having a bad day and didn't really give us a great customer experience. But my rating isn't based on the service, it's based on the food.

I went to Animal for the first on Friday night, and to be honest with you, it was the first time I had even ever heard of this restaurant. Like others before me have mentioned, this place is small, intimate and sparsely decorated. I went with 3 friends, and I don't recommend going in a larger group than that, due to lack of space. I thought the food was delicious They make disgusting sounding parts of an animal sound and look good. I also liked how they pair up some of the dishes and bring them out as "course"  instead of all at once. My only beef with the joint (and reason they get four stars instead of 5)  is that between "courses" they would change your plate and silverware. I'm sorry, but I don't need three plates for one meal, it seems like such a waste of water to wash all those dishes! We tried: Chicken Liver Toast (x2) Lettuce, Beets, Avocado, and Feta Salad Octopus Bone Marrow with Chimichurri Fried Pig Ear with Chili, Lime and a Fried Egg Pork Belly Sliders Sweetbreads Foie Gras Loco Moco Favorites from the meal: Fried Pig Ear- sliced julienne style and then fried until crispy in a spicy chili sauce... freakin' phenomenal!!! Foie Gras- I didn't even need the quail egg, spam or hamburger, I wouldn't eaten this on a plate by itself! So buttery and creamy that it litteraly melts in your mouth! Bone Marrow- I loved the fresh contrast of the chimichurri sauce mixed with the creamy bone marrow. All in all, I'd say this place is pretty darn good!

*Foie Gras in maple gravy was very lovely, highlight of the night. *The fluke was a big flop.. Waiter highly recommended the raw fluke in citrus and jalapeno ($12).  I went for it.. and bam! big disappointment, especially that I am a big sushi and ceviche fan.. a must NOT ORDER. *Melted petit basque: smells and taste amazing.. but honestly a little too heavy after the first piece. *Flat Iron steak was tasty and executed perfectly. *Doughnut in caramel sauce:  also too heavy for a dessert following a very rich meal. *gotta hit the gym now.  I am pretty sure that my cholesterol just broke the scale! ;p

My co worker swears by this place and after watching the very brief season of 'Two Dudes Catering' I made my way over to Animal. There's a reason why they call it that, 90% of the menu has some sort of meat in it. Finding the place can get a little confusing, the maps direct you somewhere near the Grove and Jack N the Box on Fairfax, but it's actually located further north between Beverly & Melrose, thank goodness the hostess specifically mentions that. We started with the Fries with Ox tail gravy and melted gruyere, it sounds crazy and it tastes crazy too. Lots of chunks of tender ox tail meat with coats of melted gruyere. I really wanted to try the foie gras loco moco but chickened out and opted for the fish. For entrees we had the flatiron steak and branzino (white fish). Both were delicious, the flatiron was coated in a melted gorgonzola sauce and the branzino was crusted with a light butter sauce. Both came with various vegetables of potatoes, artichokes, and onions. We really tried for the dessert but couldn't make it work. They have a list of unique beers and wines which accompany their very different menu. The staff is friendly and the space is cute, a little on the small side but cute. I had a positive experience here, my only thing was that everything was a little on the heavy side. This is definitely the place to go when you're looking for something savory and homey, no light dishes and salads available.

This was my second meal during my Memorial day weekend eating rampage through LA, and I must say that it was pretty darn good. We had the following dishes: Pig ear, with chilli, lime and a fried egg - This dish was ok, a little over flavored and didn't really bring out the chewy texture of pig ear that I'm used too. Barbecue Pork Belly Sandwiches - What can I say? If it has pork belly in it... I'll order it... plain and simple... and this dish didn't disappoint. Each sandwich comes with 2 chunks of artery clogging pork belly. The meat has been cooked in a sweet sauce that accompanies the belly very nicely and cuts the fattiness as well. Foie Gras with Biscuit and Gravy - This was the surprising winner of the night. the bold rich flavor was complimented by the sweet maple syrup perfectly and the biscuit played its role perfectly as it was crumbly and soaked in the gravy and syrup flavors. Definitely a heavier dish though. Foie gras loco moco - An off take on the Hawaiian dish, this was a little under whelming after having the dish above. The flavors of the foie gras didn't come out as well as I thought it should have; especially at this price point. Chicken liver toast - excellent for what it was. Bone Marrow with carmelized onions - excellent as well. I wish they served a little more. Bacon chocolate bar - kinda like a dark chocolate Crunch bar with bacon bits at the end. I was hoping the bacon flavor would be more infused into the chocolate. Tres Leches - definitely a must try. Light and creamy. Good ending to the night. All in all, a very good (expensive) experience. Unfortunately this was my second meal of the night so I might have enjoyed it even more had I not eaten before. And props for having a cool name. Enjoy!

Wow, a year and half later and I am so glad I decided to come back.  The snout to tail approach or is just snout and tails is definitely a winner.  The service was 1000x better.  The food was just as good as last time and we tried all new items.   Since all the courses were YUMMO, they all get YUMMO as the modifier.  The courses we involved ourselves fully in where the grilled octopus with sausage and chow-chow (pickled pepper relish kinda thing).  Then came the pork belly sandwiches with a deliciously sweet BBQ saucing and cole slaw on little buns.  This was followed up by another porking...yup, I said porking.  We got the balsamic glazed ribs that we were informed take about 10 hours.  Damn, these were just fall of the bone YUMMONESS.  Then for our main course, which I think everyone should be required to get at the restaurant, was the Foie Gras Loco Moco.  Hamburger, Spam, F.G. and a quails egg all layered over rice and then served with this sweet tangy savory siracha dotted sauce.  I think my fiance and I ate this dish and set some kind of land speed record for finishing it.   Too full for dessert but that bacon crunch bar sounded good as well as the daily pie offering of peaches and raspberries.  But will definitely be returning for another Animal experience on the next LA excursion.

Went last night and i thought the food was fantastic. Highlights were the oft mentioned Mini Petit Basque, Flatiron Steak and homemade doughnuts. They had a pretty obscure wine selection but what we tried was delicious. Only gripe is that with the place so small, and echoing walls, it got really loud. Put some acoustic foam on those walls and it would quieten down and i could maybe hear the people i was eating with.

As much as a food lover that I am, I have never been into fine dining until now...When my friends asked me to eat out at Crustacean, Mastro and all of those places, I honestly have no interest in going there again ever since I've tried them, but this place...OMG OMG OMG...is seriously worth it...! FOIE GRAS TO DIE FOR...OMG OMG OMG...EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS but i can't never forget the FOIE GRAS yummm both FOIE GRAS! We were a group of 8 and we had two of everything that we ordered...The Balsamic Ribs were the last to come out so we were practically full, but i bet if we weren't full, we'd finish it right off the bat! Seems like everyone is raving for their chocolate+bacon combo, it didn't really hit it for me... I'D LOVE TO COME BACK AGAINNNNNN YUMMMMMMM!!!!

Every time I come to Animal I always get superb service and insanely rich, meaty, animal-y food. It's gourmet, testosterone, stoner, perfection. My favorite thing I've ever had there is the oxtail poutine. You've never had anything like it. The marrow is also pretty amazing. You'll feel like you're going to hell and...you just might. But it will be worth it.

First of all, this place serves rich food (with a few lighter options) and if that's not what you want... then don't go here. It's a small place, very minimalistic, and the lighting is pretty low. The smallness makes the restaurant pretty loud with the din of diners and the music playing in the background. I made reservations almost a week ahead of time for a Saturday dinner (probably a good idea if you want to be able to pick your time). Hamachi Tostada - I really liked this one. This was a nice and refreshing first dish. It was Vietnamese style cabbage salad on top of thin slices of Hamachi on a fried wonton (?). Marrow Bone with Chimichurri - You get half a bone with the chimichurri sauce on top. Ours came with 2 toasted pieces of bread. The herbs in the sauce gave a different twist to marrow that I haven't had before. Quite tasty. Pork Belly Sliders - pork belly = fatty, so don't expect anything less. Don't get me wrong, the big chunks of pork belly, topped with bbq sauce and slaw are decadent and very tasty, but very very bad for you. Just don't eat it everyday! Poutine - This poutine has a pot roast type meat on top of the fries as well as the gravy and cheese that I expected. This was good too, but by the time we got to this dish, we were getting full and overloaded by the richness. Tres Leches cake - This is good, but super sweet. It made the rootbeer I ordered (which I thought was quite sweet) seem like nothing. Despite that, we polished the plate. I'd definitely come back again, but first I think I need to let my body recover from the decadence.

Fantastic food and service - Definitely going back for the Foie gras w/ biscuit & gravy...the foie gras was cooked perfectly with a very nice sear.   The burrata with yuzu was good - the yuzu was lost - didn't taste the yuzu at all but the cheese was nice. The petit basque w/ chorizo was delicious.  A heavy hitter but a smart portion and best shared or if you're feeling gluttonous by all means... Main course was shared for veal - very nice. Desserts...the bacon chocolate bar was good.  I expected it to be a little stronger on the bacon - i crave sweet and salty.  The chocolate was very dense and not as sweet as I had expected but all around good.  It was upstaged however with the dulce de leche cake...WOW!!!  Soooo light and perfect and fantastic.

This was a really fun dining experience, and the food was delicious!  We sat at the bar since we didn't have reservations, and the bartender was extremely attentive and friendly. The balsamic ribs were incredibly tender, moist, and perfectly sweetened with a rich balsamic glaze.  The bone marrow was another tasty dish, and the chimmichurri (sp?) was a nice touch, as it added just the right tang to balance out the savory marrow.  The strawberry shortcake dessert was out of this world delicious!! Minus one star for having to order everything up front and all at once.  I'm the type that likes to take one dish at a time, and then decide what I feel like next.  It was tricky and annoying for me to have to come up with my entire menu all at once.  I ordered 2 dishes and 1 dessert, and could have ordered more if not for that silly rule.

I love me some pig, and if you love pig and other meats, you should try Animal. Location is a bit tricky, so for all you beasts, look for Supreme, and its the spot right next to it. Mrs. Ninja and I tried: marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions -I wanted to order another one, this is highly addictive barbeque pork belly sandwiches-best pork belly sandwich I have ever tasted, comes in a pair so its good to share (about slider size) poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - good, pretty big portion too foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - seared just right, with the perfect amount of char on the foie gras, and the gravy had a sweet ending to it I will be back soon to try more stuff from their menu, since it changes from time to time. Make sure you reserve!

I was extremely excited to try Animal, after hearing so many great things about it. But upon leaving, I couldn't help but wonder why it has gotten such great reviews. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't necessarily bad...but it wasn't necessarily good either. We started with the chicken liver toast. Too rich, too thick. The first two bites were good and from there on I began to feel slightly sick. The next dish we got was the duck confit which was good, but I thought did not mix well with the apples it was served with. Next came the melted petit basque with chorizo and bread. That was a highlight dish from the appetizers. We also got the balsamic pork ribs which were way over-sauced with an extremely pungent glaze. After the appetizers we all split the flat iron steak with  artichoke hash and truffle parmesan fondue. Amazing, but definitely only if you like your meat to be slathered in sauce. And finally, upon receiving the dish I had been waiting for, the bacon crunch bar, I was very very disappointed. The chocolate was very rich and I felt would have gone well with sweeter bits of bacon, as opposed to smokey little bits. It clashed and I didn't enjoy it at all. I don't recommend coming here. The food does not match the price or the hype.

I just checked out Animal with a friend last week.   The servers and bartenders were super friendly, and gave the restaurant some much-needed warmth.  I am all for minimalist taste, but the lack of ambiance at Animal seems more like laziness than a deliberate choice.  The restaurant is decorated so sparsely that my friend and I agreed that we felt like we were dining in the middle of an art gallery, minus the art. The food was good, but I was very glad our vegetarian friend had bailed on us at the last minute.  When I called to make the rezzie, I was assured there were many vegetarian options.  There were not.  I enjoyed my fish paired with peas and white beans, and my companion seemed happy with her salad.  She was less pleased by the other dish she ordered that seemed mostly like a bowl of pepperoni coated in melted cheese... Overall Animal gets 3 stars from me.  They have decent food and friendly staff however, their wine list is pretty blah and pricey and the décor is severely lacking.

One of my favorite restaurants in L.A.  I've been 3 times and every time the menu has changed.   The last time I was there we ordered. -- Chicken liver crostini. B + Very tasty.  Excellent starter. -- Bbq pork belly sandwiches. C + Too much slaw, tough to really taste the pork. -- Hamatchi w/ pineapple & peanuts. B + Sweet yet spicy.  Good quality fish.  Big fan. -- Quail fry w/ grits and bacon. A Everything about this dish worked.  I could have eaten 2 or 3 of them. -- Sweetbreads B + Tasted like a gourmet chicken nugget.  The chefs prob. wouldn't like that description.  They were great. -- Pig ears, w/ chili, lime, and a fried egg. C Not for me, but some people swear by it.   -- Chocolate bacon crunch bar. B Its their signature dessert and it's excellent. -- Joe's donuts.  A I love donuts and these are awesome. This is a cool restaurant with some great dishes.  Get high and enjoy your dinner.  Just don't bring someone who's a vegetarian and you'll have a fun time.

Where do I even begin?  Animal was first brought to my attention via "Best Thing I Ever Ate" on the Food Network.  Duff Goldman told me I had to go here to try the Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar so I did.  And what better time to try an adventurous new eatery than on my birthday? This is an AMAZING tapas style, 45 seat restaurant with a menu that's to die for.  Best thing to do is have everyone order a couple plates and share.  If you do this, I promise it will be an evening of incredible food-gasms.  Would definitely suggest making a reservation because this place stays packed! Here's what we got: marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions - I'd never had bone marrow before but it was so good (even if it looked like clams). ricotta ravioli, lemon, basil, pecorino, olive oil- maybe a little heavy handed with the lemon but still good none the less. melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread - Hands down favorite!  It was like eating French Onion Soup minus the soup part.  The sheep's cheese was incredible. crispy rabbit legs, sliced heirloom tomato, aioli - I didn't get to try this but it looked yummy enough :) quail fry, grits, chard, slab bacon, maple jus - SO good.  The grits were unexpectedly sweet (i'm used to the flavorless variety that you have to doctor up with butter and pepper).  The quail was tender and moist and the bacon was a great compliment to the rest of the dish. poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - I'd like to consider this a very creative twist on chili cheese fries.  I wasn't sure if I would like the oxtail gravy but it was exceptional. flat iron, asparagus hash, truffle parmesan fondue - If I die tomorrow, at least I'll know I've had the pleasure of experiencing this.  So tender, so flavorful, so cheesy...mmmmm :) foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger - Another one I didn't get to try but it looked kind of like a small sampler platter. bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise - Ok, it was very good BUT I can't honestly say it was THE best thing I've ever eaten.  Definitely high up on the list (I'll say top 10) because I love sweet, salty, crunchy combinations.  I felt it could have used more bacon bits or more of the walnuts. We also got a bottle of the Syrah which was excellent. Animal is a gem in LA and a absolute must try.  Who knows, if you're lucky you might even find Jesus.  Seriously, there's a guy wandering around that area dressed as the Messiah and you might see him walk by.

I finally made it here after hearing so many good things about the place. Went with a group of 6 and we had: chicken liver toast - liked this very much. this is more for pate lovers. bone marrow - mmmm this was goooood. pig ears - can't go wrong when a dish has a fried egg on top. hamachi tostada - a good, refreshing dish to have in between all the rich dishes. purslane - this was just weird. stick to the animal dishes. bbq pork belly sandwiches - i could eat these all day. so delicious!! order more than 1 order of these. poutine - eh, i could have done without this dish. it was just okay. sweetbreads - so rich and good. order this foie gras, biscuit, & maple sausage gravy - another favorite. just sinful. in other words, we ordered almost all of the menu. AlthoughIi thoroughly enjoyed most of the dishes, they became very heavy and rich towards the end, and I almost wished there were some veggies added. However, now I know next time to just eat light a day or two before coming here to prepare myself for this massive artery clogging feast!

I have a feeling I'm going to be repeating a lot of what was said previously here. My experience was perfect. I happened to come back to my hometown of Los Angeles for a day and decided that I needed to try out Animal. I did not regret my decision. My friend and I split 4 dishes. I absolutely loved the Pork Belly Sliders which are tender and juicy. Perfection. The Bone Marrow was the other favorite...the green sauce that topped it off was impeccable and made for a perfect combination of flavors. We also had fois gras, which was good, but at the end of the night, too rich for my taste considering the presentation. It was just too much at that point. The Halibut was perfect and light, however, and I would highly recommend it. The service was impeccable. Our waiter was not only attentive, but fun. He rolled with the punches and joked around with us, which made the experience even less pretentious than I expected. I actually really enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant. It didn't come with a side of pretentiousness like many high-end restaurants in LA. Another bonus is the availability of house red or white wine for only $20 per bottle. For a restaurant of this quality, I thought it was a good deal. I would say that overall, this restaurant offers one of the best values for food in the US. The 4 of us ordered 8 dishes and had 2 bottles of wine and each left only about $50 poorer and tipsy. Not bad :)

I've been here twice and have both times been equally satisfied. We ordered a bunch of small plates and I would have to say that maybe just one dish out of 8 was so so and everything else was fantastic. I think it's a hit and miss with the salads (coz as much as I love meat, I need a break). The first time was amazing. I forgot what it was but it was delicious. The 2nd time I had the melon salad and I thought that was okay. Too dessert like for my taste. I wish I had the carrot salad but I was avoiding it since I'm not a big fan of the carrots. I'm deducting a star coz of the salad choices but seriously I don't think I should. So if anything, my rating is 4 1/2 stars. anyway, on to the good stuff. We started off with the chicken liver on toast. I don't know if it's for everybody but it's definitely for me. It's a lot bigger than I had expected but I'm glad it was. Next was the grilled octopus. OMG. The BEST damn octopus ever!~ and probably my favorite dish out of the entire night! Even against the foi gras and I LOVE foi gras. This is a must. Even if you hate seafood, you have to order this. It's so goooood. Then we had the Bone Marrow... this I found delicious. But mostly for the chimichuri that it came with. I barely tasted the marrow. I'm a bit biased too since baked marrow is not how I usually like my marrow. Coming from the Philippines, we usually had marrow in soup which i find holds more flavor. I think I would pass on ordering this one, but still eat it if it was in front of me. for chimichuri purposes only. hehe Next up, Head Cheese dish. So good. So gooood. order this. If you're squeamish, get over it and eat it. It's that good. Foi gras... loved it. Liked the loco moco more than the Foi with Biscuits though. So on our 2nd trip to Animal, we finally were able to save room for desserts. and boy oh boy am I glad we did. Let me tell you... bacon and chocolate,.. sounds good right? BUT it exceeded expectations. It was perfect. I think this is something you HAVE to get. Save room. It's an experience. So basically, I love Animal. Biding my time... Can't wait to go back.

This was my second visit and was surprised that this place could live up to my first impression....similar to a second date but that's besides the point. This place produces the most unique and exotic tapas....not sure why i refer to it as tapas...I usually never share my orders... Man up on the Lipitor and Wine - may i recommend the Savennieres - Chateau de L'Eperonniere. If I had keeled over after this dinner - my tombstone might have read: 1 order - marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions 1 order - foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy 2 order - foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger 1 order - head cheese, pickled ramp vinaigrette, cornbread 1 order - flat iron, asparagus hash, truffle parmesan fondue 1 order - melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread 1 order - poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar PEACE OUT!

After hearing accolades my expectations were probably a notch too high. Nonetheless Animal delivers a satisfying dinner experience. Aside from a fun menu the prices are totally reasonable for this type of operation. The staff is on point - five stars for them - Friendly prompt helpful. I was slightly underwhelmed by the food. My first time eating pig tail - they are crunchy and fatty with a little meat, a great idea to make buffalo style (but just so you know real buffalo style is blue cheese not ranch!) Biggest complaint - the balsamic ribs just didn't do anything for me. Next time I'll try the sliders but I have slider fatigue :( Also the coconut porter is money!

Animal (Noun)  [an-uh-muhl]  - A restaurant feared by vegetarians and religions who do not believe in the consumption of pigs.   Not much to say except that everything was great.  The pork belly sliders won my heart.  The marrying of pig fat, sweet, salty, savory, and umami come together on a soft brioche that i can't describe.  Somehow every single bite taste different but had the same hints of explosive flavor.

Had dinner here last night 2/9- we had reservations for a party of 3 at 6pm. They will NOT seat you until your entire party is there and you must all be there within 15 minutes of your reservation. This is a small restaurant (beer & wine only) in a "up in coming" neighborhood of LA. The producer of Everybody Loves Raymond is the owner and total foodie. You CANNOT make any substitutions on the menu. Every dish is served they way as it is described on the menu. The appetizers we ordered included: -barbecue pork belly sandwiches, slaw -ricotta & goat cheese gnocchi in a bologenese gravy -poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy The entrees we ordered included: -foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger -balsamic pork ribs, delicata squash, cippolini onion vinaigrette ALL I have to say is amazing! Everything was fabulous but my FAVORITE dish and is a must if you dine here was the barbecue pork belly sandwiches, slaw! AMAZINGNESS! The gnocchi because it is one of my favorite Italian dishes was also toward the top of my list! Ordering family style so you can get a taste of everything is the way to go! The food is heavy but everything tasted so good! Highly recommend for foodies and for someone like myself who attempts to be a foodie but seems to order the same "aka safe & plain" dishes when at a restaurant! ANIMAL doesn't allow substitutions and I did go out of my comfort zone and tried dishes that I would not normally order!

Dishes you've had before elsewhere, yet exquisitely prepared with top ingredients.  Tender lamb meatballs with a hint of mint, a dollop of creaminess, on rice.  Pork belly sliders (creamy crunchy rich) on a buttery brioche bun.  Chicken liver drizzled with sauce (a wine reduction?) and spread on toast. And a cherry panna cotta that tastes like fresh made cream, silky on the tongue. Didn't make reservations, walked in at 6:30 and had no trouble getting two seats at the bar (only 7 seats, filled up shortly after that)

Food was adequate at best.  You order something that sounds crazy, like brains, etc., but it's so covered in sauce and spices, that it's impossible to discern the meat's flavor.  Everything begins to taste like the base.  In other words, Animal is a great place to go if want to be able to tell yourself you ate crazy stuff, even though it taste nothing like it.

Oh my goodness, this is one of my FAVORITE restaurants EVER. My BF and I were reminiscing the other night about our favorite meals together and low and behold -- this one is the WINNER. He took me here for my birthday and it was DELICIOUS. I ordered the fried pigeon on top of grits. O my...and for dessert, I had Tres Lechés cake. Mm.  it melted in my mouth.......But really, in all seriousness..this place is fantastic...we can't wait to go back again...and try their other dishes and desserts.

Overrated. Went with a friend, place is so loud, sound echoing off the walls, you'll have to scream to hear each other. Kale salad - okay. Melted petit basque - best dish, but very rich, the oil gave me a headache House smoked pork belly - TOO fatty, should've listened to the waiter and gotten the kim chi pork belly Quail fry - was okay, KFC-like chicken-like, grits w/the sauce were excellent, the bacon slabs were mostly fat too Joe's doughnuts - good, sweet, but nothing extraordinary

I didn't think it was bad.  But I didn't think it was good either.  This is mainly summed up by a comment a member of my party made - "Wow, the appetizers and desserts are really great.  Too bad the entrees sucked."  And I'd have to agree. I had the famed shaved asparagus.  I liked it.  It was heavily marinated so it tasted more like marinade than asparagus.  But I liked the flavor and having it shaved was a nice touch. Then I had the Mahi-Mahi.  And whaddaya know, it tasted like the asparagus.  Like it had the same sauce as the asparagus.  Amateur move, IMO.  Actually, very much in line with what a caterer might do.  Oh wait, aren't these guys caterers?  Hmmmmm.  So that was pretty disappointing. I tasted 3 desserts.  Chocolate pudding was yummy.  Strawberry Shortcake was fairly yummy.  But there was a blueberry/peach crisp-type dessert that was a cousin to a cobbler that really enjoyed.  Yummiest of all. Not planning to go back and wouldn't send my friends there.  But it was fine.  As three stars indicates on yelp, A-OK, and nothing more.

With a restaurant name like Animal, there's almost a sense of arrogance about what you think you do well - which is anything non-seafood or vegetable related. Man is instinctively carnivorous, making Animal the ideal place to eat when you want to return back to your roots. Many people have talked about this restaurant, since day 1, about their unique skill with beef, pork, and other land animal meat. After looking at my list of restaurants to try . . . we decided tonight's the night. After fighting traffic, toward this part of town, I was happy get a nice imported Japanese beer. I strongly suggested that my friend get the Mexican coke - since it is made much sweeter than the American counterparts. The menu was quite simple & clear, and very much straight to the point with their "meat" selections. The menu doesn't try to fool around with fancy words and descriptions. When I saw loco moco on the menu, I was immediately taken back by my Maui experience, last year, during my friend's wedding weekend. Though the loco moco I had, at this famous local hangout, was overwhelmingly large and intimidating with its enormity - it kinda scared me from future loco moco's. I had since not considered ordering it again.(I profusely apologize for my crappy English - I wasn't sure how to explain it) But then I see Animal's take, on this famous Hawaiian dish, with foie gras. After mulling over my other options, the Foie Gras in the Loco Moco just stood out. After a recommendation from our server - I knew I had to order it - it was almost destiny. Perhaps Loco Moco deserved another chance to redeem itself. As some of you might know, the manner by which foie gras is acquired is quite inhumane. I was made aware of unethical treatment to our feathered pals, by my friend, who consciously chooses to limit her foie gras consumption to once a year. But on this plate - there were two very large pieces of foie gras. Personally, i don't really order foie gras and don't have a big craving for it either. But tonight, the foie gras stood out. With each bite of the loco moco - with foie gras, burger, spam, and egg, this combination made me understand this goose liver appeal. By itself, each of these pieces remain unspectacular, but together as one, like a fine ensemble, it plays out beautifully. And did I tell you about the pork belly? And I almost had to fault my server for not even touching upon it while we were ordering. Later on, he did mention that critics and others have raved about the pork belly. He kept trying to push other appetizers. But the pork belly with kimchi, this easy combination, just screamed at me, more so than the loco moco. When it came, inside I knew I would be comparing this to Japanese Izakaya style pork belly. This dish excelled and exceeded with its crunchy fat. The fat on the pork belly also melted in your mouth with eat bite, and yet stayed crunchy as well. I think, "this is the best pork belly that I have ever tasted, Period." In addition we had the bacon chocolate crunch bar, with anglaise. I don't have an idea what the anglaise is. But the combination of bacon with chocolate brought a new taste sensation in chocolate that I have never tasted before. I think I will have to make another trip to Animal. I like this place.

Excellent food. Animal is known for their unabashed approach to food. My favorite is the Foie Gras Biscuit and Gravy was a perfect harmony of savory and sweet with a symphony of textures. The biscuit has a soft fluffy center and crunchy shell. It is smothered with a thick gravy with bits of sausage and touches of maple syrup. Atop this sits a sizable hunk of foie gras. Service is quite good. They are knowledgeable and very helpful. No cocktails here. Beer and wine. Eagerly await dinning here again.

Initially, I was a little worried about this place as the name gave me the impression they would have been overly savory. Well, that turned out to be flat out wrong. The food was nothing short of excellent. Below is what we ordered: Chicken hearts (Excellent) Rabbit loin (Excellent) Marrow bone (Excellent) Foie gras with biscuit (Excellent) Ricotta ravioli (sub par compared to the rest) sticky toffee pudding (Excellent) tres leches, dulce de leche (Good) The food exploded with various flavors and textures in your mouth without any single bite ever being too over powering. And it was great to see them take a risk with a number of uncommon ingredients and pulled it off with flying colors. If you like to explore foods outside the standard menu then you have to put this place on the top of your list.

Animal made me remember how happy I am to not be a vegetarian. Everything I had here was absolutely fantastic... the foie gras biscuit, chicken liver toast, marrow bone, fried pig ear, were phenomenal. Note to my friends: take me here for my birthday. I give Animal the edge over Son of a Gun, which is also excellent, in it's own, special, little brother sort of way.

Meat Meat and More Meat. I went to Animal for the first time on Saturday and really enjoyed it...It might have been the three bottles of wine we consumed between the four of us. But overall, I give it a big thumbs up!   Things that are a must: The Ribs and The Rabbit Ravioli. We ordered family style which is a great idea because the food is rich and I can't really imagine eating just one thing, you have to try it all. For four of us we had 4 apps and 2 entrees. The bummer was that it all came out at once... so it was a bit of a sensory overload.  Overall, the staff was nice, service was ok, the ambiance was bare, but the food was Awesome.

Earthy, Tasty, Hearty. We ordered several dishes and we all enjoyed every single of one them.  All the appetizers were delicious.  My fav was the blood orange with green olives.  The folie gras breakfast dish was good.  Couldn't taste the others cuz they were pork dishes.   We ordered two fish dishes for the two wives and two loco moco's for the husbands.  Everything was delicious!  The two loco moco's were no more.  The sauce even disappeared off the plates.  They looked like freshly washed plates.  The husbands claimed that it was "FANTASTIC"! We oredered the chocolate pudding (I'll go back just for this) and the bacon chocolate.  Both good but the pudding - excellent. It's a bit pricey but worth it.  I love how everything is from the local farmers market. Oh, how could I forget the wine.  The wine recommended to us was awesome.  It went well with everything.  Hence, the reason why we polished two bottles by four people.  Yikes!

How many times have you gone to a fancy schmancy restaurant and walked away saying that the food was well executed but didn't wow you with flavor? It's happened to me multiple times, and I always feel that perhaps I'm just missing something. Am I just too low class for these places? Should I be trying to enjoy the more "subtle" flavors instead of craving something that tastes great? Well, Animal isn't that fancy schmancy restaurant. You will get great food with great taste. I'm not going to repeat what everyone else is saying. The foie gras biscuit and maple sausage, pork belly sliders and chicken liver toast were great. The pork belly was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, and they tasted great with a great barbeque sauce. The biscuit and maple sausage gravy was more than great, but then again I'm a big fan of biscuits and gravy (Has to be white gravy). The foie gras was almost an afterthought, and didn't add much to the dish though it was well executed. The pigs ears were good as well, though some at the table weren't fans of the vinegar notes. I think the poutine is a little overhyped. It was a little too salty and only had one note in terms of flavor. Now here's the kicker. I have to tout something that most people aren't extolling. In a few words, you have to try the yellowtail collar with blood oranges/onions. For those, like me, that are not fish fans because of the fishy flavor, the collar of a fish can be intimidating. This yellowtail collar was rubbed with a spice rub and the sweet/sour blood oranges/onions were a great counterpoint. The fish was fresh and the rub made it so that I could eat the well-grilled skin of the fish without noticing the fishy flavors. I think it's a great compliment to a place that it can take a food that you will not normally eat and elevate it to a level that you will eat it. I would order this dish again while extolling it's magical curative effects. Alright, maybe a little overboard, but that's almost how much I loved this dish. It was a revelation in that it allowed me to enjoy yellowtail collar for the first time in my life because I truly enjoyed it, instead of because I should enjoy it.

Very Satisfying Pig Ear was good, but tasted a little too much like Cholula hot sauce for my liking Beet Salad was great for the non meat crowd Sweetbreads were a nice intro to eating another mammal's thymus gland Lamb Chop was awesome Would go back to try some of the other menu items and some dessert as well.

My partner surprised me with dinner at Animal as an early birthday present while on a recent trip to L.A.  I knew nothing about it, although friends of ours secretly lauded my partner for scoring hard-to-get reservations.  In hindsight, I understand why. From the outside, the restaurant doesn't look like much: a rectangular dining room, spare walls with requisite Edison bulbs providing a dim, warm glow.  We were a little early, so we sat at the bar and ordered the coconut porter (they only serve beer and wine; probably a good thing in a car-culture town).  Brewed by the Maui Brewing company, the porter was surprisingly smooth and light, the finish of toasted coconut perfectly whet my appetite.  Note to self: find this beer in NYC. We decided to start light with the carrot salad; paired with avocado and parsnip chips and dressed with green goddess.  It was nice and light, but did not betray the greatness to come. Then came pig ear, crispy and shredded like gourmet bacon bits and covered with a fried egg.  The chili and lime really stretched the palate.  Very good, but the best app came next. The poutine with oxtail gravy and cheddar was one of the best courses: the fries were perfectly done, and the bits of oxtail gravy were so rich but light.  The sharp cheddar broke through every now and again, almost bringing me to tears. At this point, we noticed a familiar face standing behind us and talking to our waiter.  As this person finished and walked outside for a smoke, I realized it was Iron Chef Michael Symon, of Lola and Lolita fame.  He was eating here with 3 friends, and he had a huge grin on his face. I ordered the crispy rabbit legs as an entree; it arrived covered in dandelion and meyer lemon aioli.  Bright peas made this a play on chicken a la king, a childhood favorite.  The aioli was thick, but bright; and the rabbit meat was tender and juicy underneath a crispy, fried skin.  Another tearjerker (I should admit, I'm a sucker for meyer lemons). My partner ordered a flat iron steak, drizzled with a well-balanced truffle parmesan fondue.  The artichoke hash was so good it could have stood on it's own.  He said that normally cheese on red meat is not a good idea, but this dish was so well executed that he made an exception. The coconut porter was a perfect pairing with all of our choices; our waiter was a serious foodie and steered us well for the entire meal. For dessert, we had to go for the bacon chocolate crunch bar, with s&p anglaise.  One of four choices, it was good, but I wondered if it would be better to bring in a separate pastry chef to match the quality of the apps and entrees offered.  Even so, this was one of the best meals I've ever had. If we can score reservations again, we will come back the next time we're in LA.

If you ever get a chance to enjoy this place..GO! Absolutely a.m.a.z.i.n.g!!!  Highly recommended by the bruddah in law. Celebrated wedding anniversary #3 here and the hubby and I were all over it!!! We enjoy eating, but man this is above and beyond! I am not exaggerating. Service: Server was a little on the dry side. Don't even remember him introducing himself. Whatever. We got more action from the bus boy.  6 pm reservation. Told the hostess we had an 8 pm show at The Pantages so that she would let our server know. Server got everything out on time and we didn't feel rushed. We made ourselves late because we added on to our order. =) That should say plenty. Ready....set..go. Corkage fee: $20. Glass of wine $10. We brought a bottle. Ambience: simple. Menu: Carrot salad, parsnip chips, green goddess, avocado Grilled octopus salad, yellow wax bean salad, bagna cauda Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar (Crazy delicious: fries w/ perfect crispiness, flavorful gravy with bits of meat, and cheeeeese all together = fireworks in your mouth) Barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw (order that made us stay a little longer and could have done without. What else is there to go crazy about after the first 3 items? Nothing really, just more Poutine) Main dish: Foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger Grand Finale: Tres leches, dulce de leche (his fave, not as great as Porto's) Bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise (two generous pieces, one will do, the bits of bacon are really tiny. You be the judge) Came here for the Foie gras loco moco, left in L.O.V.E with the Poutine. Will mos def come back and try bone marrow, lamb meatballs, more poutine, and foie gras biscuit maple sausage gravy, pound cake, and panna cotta. Price range $3 to $35. Well worth the money. Can easily do $100 bucks if you don't do any alcohol. The food alone will make you feel like you are on cloud 9. Reminds me of food in NYC. So Cal needs more places like this!

different ingredients (usually things i have never heard of) put together beautifully...is what makes this restaurant unique and a must try at least once in your hipster phase/life.  or if you are a true yelper, you should have eaten here already.  the waiter said they had ran out of poutine (which, again, i'm sorry, have no idea what the hell that is)... but that did not affect my Animal experience. i will recommend three things to try, but do keep in mind that their menu may change. chicken liver toast - for $3, this is suprisingly good.  bread toasted well, spread is kinda cold... but it magically tastes good. foie gras loco moco - $35 creme de la creme signature dish. rice, spam, mystery meat (whatever foie gras is), sauces... as what VICTOR L. states, "orgasm in your mouth." tres leches - i've tasted the store bought from the mexican bakery kind before, but Animal's version exceeded my expections.  not too sweet. not dry. not sooooo milky and wet. it was just right.   some others: soft egg with caviar, balsamic pork ribs that literally like fell off the bone (both good) i was not fascinated by the bone marrow or the bacon chocolate crunch bar.  but hey, if you are daring enough to try... go right ahead.   cons: there is a wait.  i had reservations at 10:30PM on a saturday to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and did not get seated until 11 because the other party of 8 were just taking their sweet time. so... i do recommend reservations after 11PM.  even midnight should guarentee you a seat. they close at 1am. sidebar: waiting the extra minutes was worth it though, because BJ Penn (UFC Fighter) just happened to be roaming the streets of Fairfax Ave that night.

I visited Animal last month and am just getting to the review now, but everything was tasty.  Here's a rundown of the feast: * pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg -- I tried it based on the high praise of other Yelpers.  Although it was good, it was not the best out of the items we had. * pork belly, kimchi, peanuts, chili soy, scallion -- By far this was the best dish of the evening.  Savory pork sitting in the chili soy and topped with kimchi almost made me sing.  The kimichi provided the perfect finish to the pork belly. * sweetbreads, creamed spinach, capers, hen of the woods -- This was decent although the smaller portion of the two pieces of sweetbreads was a little overcooked. * amberjack, orange, wakame sprouts -- This was a little wasted on me as I was not impressed at all.  It lacked flavor and was just kind of meh. * foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger -- I was surprised how well this combination worked together.  The spam actually provided the perfect amount of salt to this dish.   * tres leches, dulce de leche -- This was sooo yummy!  This was worth all the extra calories. I can't wait until my next visit.  I definitely want to try the head cheese. Service was pretty good and the wine list is decent.

Appetizer:  Crunchy Hominy with Lime.  It was delish. Me:  Flat iron steak covered in a truffle fondue with potatoes.  Heart stopping. My girlfriend:  Grouper with hedgehog (mushrooms), peas, potatoes and duck fat crutons.  Ambrosia. Dessert:  Tres leches with dulce de leche.  Incredible. Recommendations:  Make reservations WELL in advance.  I made reservations 4 days ahead of time and only had the choice of 6pm or 10pm.  We decided to take the 10pm and catch a movie first.  We ate for two and a half hours but it felt like 30 minutes.  World class food.  Very enjoyable.

It seems that I am the 1000th reviewer of Animal, but I won't be heaping more accolades onto this restaurant. Maybe the two people who told me that this was their favorite restaurant in ALL of LA made my expectations too high; maybe the fact that I don't eat red meat or weird animal gizzards put me at a disadvantage. All I know is that I left unimpressed. The food was just so-so. Although, my glass of Moscato wine (which I usually ADORE) was just plain bad and had some weird cardboard-y aftertaste. My friend ordered the pig's ear with egg and said that it tasted like "nothing," and no one really seemed to be wowed over by their food at our table, despite a $200+ bill. The restaurant itself is very minimally decorated (i.e. not decorated at all,) which makes it LOUD. Like, you're shouting but still can't hear the person next to you loud. They also don't have enough waiters! Our waitress came by maybe two or three times during the course of a 2-hour meal to check on us. And it took a long time to pay our bill. No wonder there's a line out the door! Also, I received not one but two calls confirming my reservation the day before, and the second one demanded that I call them back...Because a 7:30 reservation at Animal on a Wednesday night is evidently more important that anything else I have going on!

They're not joking when they call it a porkapalooza. Which just happens to be my favorite kind of palooza, so I was pretty much in love as I read through the menu on my first visit to Animal last weekend. Great service, great hospitality, minimal decor, great wine list - let's get all that stuff out of the way. Five Yelp-y stars, blah blah blah. Now let's talk about maple bacon gravy. And biscuits. And foie gras. And pork bellies. These dishes were so well done that they're going straight into my current top 5 list. The menu reads like it's small plates, but it's not. We came in starving, ordered four dishes, and could barely touch the last one. Aside from the foie gras biscuit and the pork belly sliders, we also ordered the octopus and the poutine - both were great, but not as outstanding as the other two. Thanks, Animal, for a foodie's dreamy evening - can't wait to do it all over again.

Before I begin my review and rant about their wine list...I will warn you: BYOB your wine here and pay the $20 corkage fee! Trust me you will be glad you did. Like shopping at Wal-mart, Animal simply leaves me conflicted. On one hand everyone loves saving a buck, but on the other hand I just can't stand Wal-mart's crowded aisles, 'clientele', and mistreatment of employees. In much the same way Anima confounds me. On the one hand the food is great  -spectacular gastropub-ish food, tons of flavor, and reasonably good service...the bad? Well, let's start with the wine list. They offer a very limited wine list filled it with obscure wines, with merely average quality and priced so ridiculously high that my nose almost started bleeding after taking a sip of $18 glass of pinot noir. Of course it was a Burgundy, but it tasted more like a boxed wine than a fine French pinot. In a city filled with oenophiles, and being so located so close to great wine producing regions, I can't see why you would offer only 5 wines by the glass from obsure producers and charge between $13-21 for average red table wine. Did they think no one would notice or do they just not know anything about wine? Foodwise.... The good: For all the hype Animal receives, I think the food is very good overall. It's reminiscent of the local food/pork/charcutie movement that has been going on in Chicago over the last 4 years.  My favorite dish was the foie gras loco moco...which featured a slice of foie gras, egg, spam a atop rice with a touch of sriracha and a tiny slice of SPAM hidden beneath the foie gras, all smothered in a rich gravy. The dish was an indulgence in multiple dimensions of flavor...fatty, salty, and spicy. We enjoyed the dish so much that we ordered a 2nd.  I also loved the biscuits and gravy. The gravy was similar to the loco moco in its richness, but was modified slightly to incorporate a bit of sweet maple syrup, which added a nice balance. We also ordered the sweetbreads, which were lightly breaded and fried. I often find sweetbreads a bit too rich, but here they cut them into smaller pieces and took a modified approach, which worked well - an excellent dish.   The bad: The potato agnolotti was a bit disappointing. A lovely white wine sauce and tasty pasta, but it just seemed a boring compared to the intense richness of the other dishes we had. Finally, the flank steak was an utter disappointment in my opinion. We ordered it medium rare and the steak came out at least medium plus. It was extremely dry and not well seasoned either. For $28 you can get a much, much better cut of steak elsewhere, and I shutter to say this but it was worse than Outback Steakhouse. Ambiance: This place is extremely loud. I could barely hear our friends from across the table. There is little to no waiting area. Service: I thought the service was very good. They brought us out clean plates after every few courses and our server was friendly and helpful. No complaints here. Bottomline: Great food for the most part. The dishes seem to be a little hit or miss, but more hits than misses on my visit. The prices seem excessive for the portion size. The wine list is just a horrible disaster. I would go back, but next time I'm going to BYOB and pay the $20 corkage fee.

For me, it was all about the desserts! Definitely will come back for the chocolate bacon crunch bar and the berry lavender crumble. Although this restaurant had quite a few delicacies on their menu, the food was mediocre. The hamachi tostada was an american-mexican-asian fusion zing, which I enjoyed. The bone marrow was interesting, but it was way too oily and fatty-like for me (I think it made my tummy wierd). We also tried the flatiron w truffle Parmesan and the halibut. None of the dishes I tried really stand out, but I would totally try the other choices next time. The service was superb. The nice waiter helped me choose a great rose champagne to go with my meal (I'm pretty picky with wine, I havent learned how to "appreciate" them yet). Coming back here for desserts next time!!!

Seriously LOVED this place. I've never been exposed to the food that I was able to enjoy here at this place. There's so much to say about this place. For starters, a late night 5-Star restaurant? That's definitely a plus. We had a reservation for 11:00, and that alone opened my eyes a bit. We arrived and were seated immediately. Now let's speak about the food. To start the meal, we had hamachi served with torn herbs, a fish sauce vinaigrette, and crispy shallots. We were able to taste every ingredient down to the last detail. Seriously outstanding. Next we had the ricotta and goat cheese gnocci served with a savory bolognese sauce. The gnocci was lighter than air! Fluffy little potato pasta pillows. Topped with the bolognese, the meal just continued to get better! The baby broccoli was up next. Served with pancetta, a slice of parmesan, bread crumbs, and a soft boiled egg on top. One of the lighter items we were able to enjoy tonight. Up next, the BBQ pork belly sliders! There was a slaw served inside of a decadent bun that made the entire sandwich off the top. The pork belly was fried and sauced to perfection. Moist and savory. The next item brought out was the crispy rabbit legs served with a meyer lemon aioli, peas, and their greens. Now.. Jardy had ordered this, and not to lie, it wasn't as great as I hoped it would be. Rabbit has a very gamy texture that did not bode well with the lemon aioli, but all in all, it wasn't the worst thing. Our last food item of the night were the sweet breads, served with creamed spinach, capers, and hen of the woods. For those who don't know, sweet breads are the glands found in the neck of veal, which are then fried to perfection. As for hen of the woods, it's actually a wild mushroom. It was a great compliment to the sweet breads. Great way to end the savory side of the meal. And now onto the sweet side of the meal. Because it was Sia's birthday, the restaurant gave us a complimentary panna cotta served with a saba sauce along with our tres leches with dulce de leche sauce. Let's start with the panna cotta. This is the first time I've ever had it, and it was definitely a dessert I would like to have again if I weren't lactose intolerant. The texture was very velvetty, almost like eating a flan. What it consists of is french vanilla, making it very light and smooth. Definitely an interesting dessert. Now, onto the tres leches. This was hands down the best tres leches cake I've ever had. Fluffy, perfect amount of sweetness, moist. Everything you'd want in a tres leches, it was there, and then some. Again, if I weren't lactose intolerant, I probably would have wanted more. All in all, two great desserts! Each dish had its own highlights, and each stood out more than another as far as flavor. The best part is the menu changes constantly, so you never come back eating the same thing. I can't wait to come back and have a taste once again!

I know I'm the millionth person to review this place but it's deserving.   I mean, this restaurant doesn't fail on any level. The food is incredible.  Starting with the buratta with salsa verde; creamy, tangy, simply delicious.  The Lemon Pecorino Ravioli was great.  Not something I haven't had before but it's done right.  The olive oil they used really stands out as does the quality of the cheese.  The Balsamic Ribs are heavenly; chewy, fall-off-the-bone tender, carmely, sweet, tangy...amazing!!!  Sweetbreads...oh sweetbreads.  I was scared at first but as soon as I tasted this dish, I was floored.  Everything in the bowl was just perfectly married together.   Dessert:  The tres leches cake...O....M....G!!!!!!!  I ate the entire thing by myself.  (I'd do it again) The ambiance is unpretentious yet intimate.  The staff is laid back and friendly, and the wine is fantastic! The pricing is on point because you are definitely getting what you pay for...quality ingredients made right.   L.A. does have good food...it's here.

This place is great. We went all out when we dined here, ordering about 8 plates plus dessert. Yummm! Although I did learn my lesson on ordering. Never again will I order so much meat! We were so full by the end of this dinner but it was definitely worth it. All flavors mesh so well that I would go back any day to have some particular dishes. I tried my first taste of head cheese. Not for me, nope! My boyfriend loved it though. I guess you can really like it or just not. He ordered some crazy dishes like the chicken liver and such. I was very satisfied with the pork belly sliders, amberjack, sweetbread, and more but since the menu changes I don't quite recall the others. This restaurant explains to everyone in the industry that you don't need a nice flashy great restaurant to score high on ratings. It's all about the food rather and good service. Our server here, a lady which I dont remember her name, was on top of it. She answered all of our questions instantly she knew the menu to a science! To end, we took the bacon chocolate crunch bar. We were so full but heard so many things about this dessert that we had to take it. It was very delightful. I would definitely come back, especially since they change their menu every so often, I'd like to see what the two guys in the kitchen are up to.

This place manages a pretty tricky feat: to somehow be unpretentiously pretentious, but in kind of a good way. No sign at the front = pretentious Simple decor with waiters who are talking to you instead of down to you = unpretentious But at the end of the day, the food speaks for itself, and it's gooooood. Very good. Potato angliotti with sage butter: easily the best tasting dish of the evening. Buttery, zesty flavor, and a soft, pillowy texture. Veal brains: a thin, crunchy crust, with an airy, fluffy center. There is also a tangy sauce that makes a great accompaniment to the dish. Delicious. Rabbit spring rolls: not greasy at all, nice and crunchy, with a little mint for a nice aftertaste. Poutine with oxtail and cheddar: I wanted to love this dish both times I ordered it, and both times I was disappointed in how incredibly salty it was. Too bad because every other component of it works: the fries stay nice and crispy even under the gravy and the oxtail is tender and generously portioned. Chocolate bar with bacon: perfectly sized dessert, ingenious flavor combination. Trust me, it's very, very yummy. The wine selection is a mix of the usual standbys with a few surprises thrown in. My friend had a smooth Cote du Rhone, and I had a light Rose. I guess a little pretentiousness is not so bad - hey, it's L.A. after all! And when the food and service make for an enjoyable evening, I guess I can let go of pretty much everything else.

What a treat!  I've been fortunate enough to dine here twice and both times were very memorable experiences. My most recent was approximately one month ago.. and I will focus on this visit for my review.  We made our reservation for 3 people approximately one week prior, which was a very good thing.. considering the place was jam-packed, even on a Wednesday evening.  We decided to go with street parking in lieu of valet, and were able to find an open spot a few blocks away on Orange Grove. Animal has a pretty small dining room with a lot of tables in close proximity (fire hazard?).  After arriving at our reserved time slot, we still waited about 15 minutes before getting seated. Before getting to the meal (which was excellent), my only gripe about this place is the service.  We were seated at least 25 minutes before anyone came by to take our order.. granted it was a busy restaurant, but the service could be a little more organized. On the menu: - Chicken Liver Toast: an excellent starter which really sets the tone for the rest of the meal.  I would definitely recommend ordering a few of these for larger parties. - Shaved Zucchini Salad: very refreshing with just the right amount of citrus.  This dish would have been perfect if it had come in the middle of the meal, as a break from all the meaty goodness. - Crispy Pig's Head: basically, they remove the meat from the cheeks, then form the meat into a patty which they bread and then fry.  I wasn't really expecting this.. overall, I felt the meat was a tad chewy.  I would probably skip this the next time. - Pig Ear: I love this stuff!  The combination of the chili, lime, and fried egg make this an absolutely perfect dish.  I've eaten some excellent pig ear in the past, but this is probably the best preparation I've ever had. - Foie Gras with Maple Sausage Gravy: you can't really go wrong with the rich creaminess of foie gras.  The maple gravy was a very interesting touch, and added a nice touch to the dish.  The maple may have been a little too sweet, but just right if you're sharing with a few friends. - Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar: this is one those once-in-a-lifetime desserts that you shouldn't pass up.  It's changed since they featured it on Best Thing I Ever Ate (it's only one bar now, and fewer layers), but it's still a very tasty way to end the meal. Overall, Animal is a nice treat.  I would definitely recommend trying this restaurant at least once.. you'll be glad you did.  5 stars!

In my life-long quest to find the best restaurant, er, the best restaurant wherever I may be at that time, I was told that Animal is a MUST TRY by a friend, whom happens to be a chef, and had a show on the Food Network. When I rate and review restaurants, I not only focus on the food, but I also focus on a lot of the other things that add to the overall experience.  Some people don't find these things important, but in the quest to find the perfect dining experience, these things are crucial. Upon arrival, they have valet parking, and it's only $5.50 with validation, and the valet guy was awesome!  Very friendly, even told me where he was gonna park my car.   We arrived about 20 mins early for our reservation, which the hostess was super friendly and sweet.  We grabbed a drink at the bar, and waited for our table.  One thing that did stand out was that they put those drinks on our dinner tab, which was super convenient.  Most restaurants don't do that. Now, on to the food... The thing I liked most about this place was the ability to eat tapas style and share the plates.  The food was AMAZING.  Simple, yet elegant, extremely fresh and well seasoned.  You can tell that these chefs taste EVERYTHING that goes out to the dining room. Here's what we ordered: lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac - this salad was super simple and tasty. grilled squid, chorizo, chimichurri - the squid was prepared PERFECTLY and the chorizo was a great compliment. ricotta & goat cheese gnocchi, early girl pomodoro - to die for.  Period. balsamic pork ribs, succotash, herb butter - Oh. My. God.  The basalmic glaze on the ribs was amazing.  The succotash was soooo good.  Fresh corn.  I mean, SUPER fresh corn. and for dessert, we couldn't resist the bacon chocolate crunch bar - how can you go wrong with bacon and chocolate? All in all, this was a fantastic meal.  The ambience was great, the food was fantastic, and the service was phenomenal.

Been wanting to eat here for quite some time. Entering the restaurant, I was digging the feel and casualness of it. My dining companions decided to order a few dishes and share, which I suggest is the best thing to do to get the best experience. - Ricotta Ravioli, lemon, basil, pecorino, olive oil - Pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg - Hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut - Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - Foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger - Bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise Our meal started out ok with the ravioli and pig ear, but kicked it into high gear with the hamachi tostada. The flavors of Vietnam dressed in a Mexican presentation made for an excellent combination. The poutine was rich and delicious and you know I definitely used the fries to pick up as much of the oxtail gravy as I could. Let me stop you here for a minute and tell you about the Foie gras loco moco. If you have any doubts about ordering it, don't walk, RUN! This by far was the best dish of the night. The hamburger was basically like a steak. And the richness of the foie gras didn't detract the focus of the dish, but enhanced it. I can say without a doubt that you won't find a better Loco moco stateside. And for dessert, how could you go wrong with bacon and chocolate? I will definitely be back here to try the marrow bone, head cheese, and the sweetbreads.

Wow.  Certainly not for someone on a diet, or my vegetarian girlfriend.  I had some friends in town on business, so we decided to give Animal a try.  There were quite a few of us, so we split several plates of food.  I have to say the fried quail was delicious, but nothing compared to my artichoke encrusted fish dish.  It was amazing.  The wine was flowing fast and furious, so I can't remember every detail, but I will say the chocolate bacon bar was frightening and delicious, as were the Carmel covered donuts.  Yes, people.  I think you're catching my drift.  This place is an exercise in decadence.  You just have to throw up your hands and say, "F*ck it."  I'll have it all."  You can deal with your high cholesterol and arrhythmia in the morning.   This place has excellent service as well and the staff were extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  I recommend this place to anyone, except the health conscious or vegetarians.  Go there now.

Ok, literally, this is THEE BEST AMERICAN FOOD JOINT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. *Strongly suggest making reservations before coming here* For starters we had the arugula salad (good salad with lots of parmesan cheese, nuts and grapes), the shredded pig ear (MY FAV, lightly seasoned with an egg on top, great combo), Squid with chorizo and chimichurri (also a fav), BBQ Pork Belly sandwich (it drips down your fingers but it's so agood you want to lick it up!), head cheese (excellent!), pork belly kimchi (really good), and the fois gras (usually not a fan of liver but this was extremely rich and soo good). Big start right? They are small portions, great for trying everything on the menu. For our entrees we had the leg of lamb and the pork ribs. Succulent, the meat glided off of the bone, just mmm mmm good. THEN! For dessert (I know we ate a lot!) We had the tres leches cake (this was good, not great), bread pudding (great), and the bacon chocolate crunch bar. chocolate AND bacon? Need I say more??? Though here are some cautionary words, if you are not a big fan of chocolate, don't get it, it's super rich and chocolaty. The evening was a smaash hit and it cost about $80/person (there were 6 people in our group) but hey it's really excellent food!!

Damn.  This was one amazing meal.  Not healthy or life-lengthening, but wow, was this place good. Every thing we ordered, perhaps with the exception of the pig ear, was delicious and flawless.  Amazing tastes.  I was having some near Meg-Ryan-in-When-Harry-Met-Sally moments with each dish.  And as far as service, I have to say our waiter was terrific.  He had great recommendations for dishes and wine, paced everything in pairs (and told us he did to manage our expectations), and was a great guide through the menu. The foie gras biscuit with gravy is a must, as are the pork belly sliders.  And that bacon crunch chocolate thingie is to die for. I can't wait to return.

It was my idea to come here for my friend's bachelorette party dinner.  My friend loves meat, so I thought that "Animal" would be grossly appropriate. We got there at 7:30 but the reservations were for 8, so we got a bottle of wine and looked over the menu while we waited.  These girls are not very adventurous when it comes to trying new foods.  Their idea of "exotic" food is a lamb skewer at Daphne's Greek restaurant.  Don't get me wrong, I love these girls, it's just hard to relate as I'm a huge advocate of trying new things and getting out of your comfort zone.  Having said that, they all said they wanted the flank steak fritte.  FLANK STEAK FRITTE??!  Are you effing kidding me??!?  I mean, I'm sure it's good, but they have pork belly, fois gras, duck, quail, ribs etc. on the menu.  And these guys were on Iron Chef... c'mon!!! So we finally got seated at 8:30, and because we had waited for so long, the manager said they would comp our desserts.  That was amazing.  I would give a restaurant no less than 4 stars for service like that.   Anyways, I was good and irritated when I learned that they all wanted the steak fritte.  But then, something amazing happened.  The waitress said they were out of the steak!!!  HA! Then, these girls stepped up and ordered duck rilletes, ribs, pork belly (with kimchi and sliders) and the quail fry.  I ordered the fois gras moco loco...their take on the Hawaiian favorite, which was made up of hamburger, spam, fois gras with a fried quail egg on top.   Everyone was floored.  The food was delicious and they claimed that it was the best meal of their life.  YES!  To top off an amazing dinner, the desserts were fantastic.  Bacon chocolate crunch bar, tres leches and strawberry short cake... seriously, so good.   Thank you Animal for turning my food shy friends into full on gourmet foodies.  They even liked the fois gras!  So fun.  Will definitely be back soon.

the entire dining experience at Animal is a must for all carnivorous LA residents. the bf and i arrived 30 minutes before it even opened and killed some time getting cheesecake at Canters. when we walked back 5 minutes later, there was already a cluster of people waiting in front of Animal. you should have seen the looks we were giving each other...people were constantly glancing over their shoulder, sizing each other up, their darting eyes trying to find the quickest route into the restaurant. when the waitress pulled up the steel gate and stepped out of the way, it was a (somewhat polite) stampede towards the bar. most of the people didn't have reservations just like us. we got really lucky as an elderly couple's 3rd group member was parking his car and the waitress apologetically said she wasn't able to hold seats and sat me & bf first. i'll never forget the withering look the elderly lady gave me. i know she wanted to gut me alive. after the seating drama, bf and i excitedly perused the menu. our server was so helpful and funny. he helped me choose the perfect wine pairings for each of our dinner selections: pig ear/lime/chili/fried egg, bbq pork belly sandwiches, poutine with oxtail gravy & cheddar, and balsamic pork ribs. WOW. each dish was exquisite and delicious in it's own unique way. i felt like each dish took on it's own personality and i was making a new friend with each bite. the pig ear was crispy, chewy, tangy, spicy, and creamy all at the same time. i had the hardest time wrapping my brain around all the textures and flavors mingling in my mouth. it was seriously the best dish out of the four we ordered (in my opinion). bf absolutely loved the bbq pork belly sandwiches. i thought it was very good too. the crispy pork belly and cool slaw combination was familiar yet new at the same time. i liked the sticky crispy balsamic pork ribs as well. the balsamic glaze was burnt in certain spots and the crispy bits added more dimension to the overall flavor of the dish. the dish i dont have rave reviews for is the poutine only because i'm lactose so i couldn't have too much without fearing of the hell that would ensue once i got home. i can't say enough about how great Animal was. both bf and i thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and we will definitely be back soon to check out their other offerings.

My mouth was tingling after eating here.  The fried pigs ears were DEEELLLIIICCCIOUUS.  I know it doesn't sound appetitzing, but it was like the perfect match with my beer.  Salty tangy crunchy, very baconesque.  Another favorite was the bone marrow, so rich and velvety it was like eating the soul of the animal.  muhhahhahaha. What was really weird was the dude eating by himself reading a book and ipod headphones in.   Really?  REALLY? I usually eat at MCD's if I'm rocking that vibe.

At first I was annoyed because they don't have a sign.  Call it a neighborhood bistro, call it what you want, but I think that's absurd.  Then I was annoyed because it seemed to be too pricey for small dishes.  I was being taken out and I always feel self conscious about ordering when the plates are small and the prices high. Things changed when both of our servers turned out to be SOOOOOO cool, attentive, nice, gave great suggestions...they were just AWESOME. Everything there was pretty good.  The sweetbreads were a decent size, though I'm thinking maybe I'm not such a huge fan of sweetbreads, even though the caper brown butter was deeeeelish.  The petite basque with chorizo was yummy yum and fatty as hell.  The lamb avioli were good, but small, and the lamb was very lamb-y.  Meaning it was kind of game-y and overpowered the goat cheese.  At least that's what my dining companion thought. I thought it was pretty damned tasty.  But what not to miss are the poutine and the bacon chocolate crunch bar for dessert.  They truly are must-haves!  The poutine has oxtail gravy, and I could taste it had some depth from the wine they put in the gravy.  As fatty and rich as most of the dishes here are (fois gras, petite basque), the poutine wasn't overly greasy or heavy, and I really appreciated that, as it allowed me to eat more of it.  :)  nom nom nom.

If I had a grip of money to blow and I wanted to give myself a gourmet food coma and heart attack, I'd come here.  The food is so rich and indulgent, I could've sworn my arteries were clogging up when I took a bite out of the pork belly sliders.  The food is excellent, the ambiance is awesome, and this place made me a fan of pork again. I think it's hilarious that this place, which specializes in pork dishes, is right across a kosher meat market.  LOLFAIL at that part.

I was brought to Animal by The Best Thing I Ever Ate, Bacon edition on Food Network. I saw the Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar and I knew I had to have it! I came here with my girlfriend and admittedly I had a hard time finding the place. Why? There's no sign on the restaurant! We just took a hunch and walked in, and lucky enough we found it. Another thing I didn't account for, you need a reservation to eat here! So make sure you do your research. Luckily the bar had two seats open for walk ins so we got to eat that night! The restaurant had a dim light setting and high ceilings, and the walls were a soft white. Already enough to impress my girlfriend. The thing I found funny was there were about four pictures in the restaurant, and instead of being appropriately scattered around, they were just jumbled up together by the bar. Our server/bartender was outstandingly helpful! He let us know his recommendations and how to what we ordered. Checked up on us often and had a great personality to match his service! I must say the food here is INTERESTING. If you are into trying something new, or know someone that is, this is the place to go! If you're wondering why the place is called Animal, you'll know soon enough when you get the menu. If you're here with a couple people, it's best to order multiple dishes and hit the food family style. You'll enjoy it more :) Marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions - Served with an awesome piece of garlic toast. The marrow was fatty and went well with chimichurri, which was full of flavor, and caramelized onions. Barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw - DERRRRICIOUS! You get two sandwiches with some tangy slaw. The BBQ pork is a combo of meat and fat and the tangy slaw is the perfect compliment to the BBQ sauce! Pig ear in chili lime sauce, fried egg - Not what I expected but super tasty! They cut up the pig ear into small strips and you mix everything together like a salsa and enjoy. It really reminds me of something, but I can't seem to put my tongue to it. Bacon chocolate crunch bar - Moment of truth. In all honesty, it was okay. A lot of hype but still good. My girlfriend gave me her bacon bits; killed the purpose but more bacon for me! You have to eat it all together. Try it if you haven't, but I'm trying something else the next time I go; which is soon!

Wow, this place is AMAZING!  I am a total foodie and I love to try new things, so this was the perfect place for me.  We couldn't get reservations, so we showed up about 15 minutes before they opened and waited outside.  When they opened, we got seated at the bar right away (to the dismay of some other people who got there later and didn't have reservations).  So, I would definitely recommend reservations, but if you don't have them, show up early and stand RIGHT by the door. So, the menu can be a little overwhelming with all the items that I have never even heard of.  However, the waitress was great about asking us if we had questions or needed any clarification.  She checked with us several times to see if we had any more questions. We ordered several dishes (not all at once) and they came out pretty darn quickly considering the complexity of the food.  My boyfriend had the mint tea and I sampled it...was very tasty.  I didn't have any wine, but I noticed that in the time we were there, about 30 bottles went out to other tables.  The cool thing is, the servers have to taste the wine before they serve it to make sure it's good, especially if they're just pouring a glass from an already opened bottle.  I very much appreciate that. So here is the food we ordered: 1.  Chicken Liver Toast:  This was DELICIOUS!  I love chicken liver and it had a good amount of garlic in it as well as caramelized onions atop the liver.  $3 for one medium sized toast covered with liver. 2.  Chicken Hearts with lima bean, baba ghanoush, and yogurt.  I was weary of eating the heart of an animal, but the texture was great and the flavor combinations complimented each other so well.  The hearts were rich and sweet and the lima bean, baba ghanoush, yogurt mix was tangy.  $8 for a large plate with about 12 hearts on it. 3,  Barbecue Pork Belly Sandwiches.  This was a bigger portion, came with two slider sized sandwiches.  The pork belly was very crispy on the outside and the inside melted in my mouth.  The sandwich was on a brioche bun and it had a homemade barbecue sauce mixed with a homemade slaw of cabbage and carrots with a tangy sauce.  These were ridiculously good.  $12 for two sandwiches. 4.  Pig Ear with Chili, Lime, and Fried Egg.  I was a little scared to eat this one as I always get grossed out by the pig ears at the pet store.  However, the pig ear was sliced very thinly and fried (I think) with a delicious crispy outside.  This was mixed with scallions and a sweet but pretty spicy lime sauce.  The fired egg is supposed to cut the spiciness, but I think it could have been just fine without it.  $12 for a medium sized plate 5.  Veal Brains with Vadouvan and Applesauce.  This was ok.  I have never had brains before, so I wasn't expecting them to be so mushy.  I was thinking more of a chewy texture.  They were breaded and fried in a delicious batter though.  The sauce was very tasty, but I was not a fan of the texture.  Plus, it freaks me out to eat the brain of an animal.  My mom grew up on a farm and had to eat cow brains and eggs for breakfast every morning, so I can't wait to tell her I ate them of my own free will! $14 for a small plate...not worth it cause I didn't like the dish. 6.  Sweetbreads with creamed spinach, capers, and oyster mushrooms.  Another additional ingredient of this one was a crap ton of butter.  That's what makes it all the more tasty.  The sweetbreads were lightly breaded and fried, the spinach was super creamy and complimented the woodsy taste of the mushrooms well.  Since the dish was so rich, the capers and a few chunks of lemon pulp cut the intensity very nicely.  It was like a flavor circus in my mouth!  $16 and well worth it.  Came on a large plate and was quite a large serving.  Little less than an entree, little more than a small plate. 7.  Foie Gras Loco Moco with Quail Egg, Spam, and Hamburger.  I find it hilarious that the first time I try spam, it's with foie gras!  This dish was my ultimate favorite.  It was extremely rich (as foie gras can be) and the combination of hamburger, spam, and foie gras was intense.  However, it came atop a small grain rice with a tangy ponzu like sauce that really helped cut through the richness of the dish.  $35 for a pretty dang large portion and I don't think I could eat it all by myself.  This is more of an entree sized dish, but you should definitely share it. 8.  DESSERT!  Sticky Toffee Pudding with Mascarpone and Orange.  This was soooooo delicious!  The pudding was like a really rich, condensed bread pudding and it was topped with crunchy salt.  The sauce was a thick, rich toffee/caramel combination and the mascarpone was spread beneath the slices of the pudding.  This tasted like a salty pretzel combined with a super rich toffee caramel and some light cream to soften it up.  I would highly recommend it.  $7 was not a bad price for the dish.  Came with two pretty thick slices (rectangles), but you can't eat more than that anyway.

So I came here expecting a five star meal after friend's suggestions and the reviews, and was a little let down.  If we'd stuck to the appetizers it would have easily been 5 stars, but the entrees seemed uninspired and only "meh" after the superlative appetizers whose delights I shall regale you with dear reader as this review meanders forth.  Maybe the other entrees were better, but the grouper and the mexican shrimp, both touted by our waiter were fairly ho-hum.   Now to the delicious apps: Kimchee pork belly- light sharp kimchee esque salad with a deliciously greasy pork belly.  This was a winner with homey and subtle flavours executed masterfully. Oxtail poutine- I've had many poutine varieties ( most of them in Montreal) and this is a clse second to  the fois gras poutine at au Pied de Cochon.  The fries were delicious and the oxtail fatty enough to stand up to the heavy gravy and cheese.  Another 5 star treat which alone is worth a trip here fois gras on a biscuit- exceptional, but this is one that's tough to screw up.  The biscuit instead of the traditional  crouton was appreciated, as was the abstinence from use of warm spices like vanilla and cinnamon balsamic reduction ribs- sweet tangy and delicious, you can't go wrong with these as they appeal to basic tastes without being too heavy.  The ribs were also crock pot soft whcih is a big plus for me. confit duck on salad- pretty traditional in execution, a salad with frisee, nuts, and dried fruit topped with what might be my alltime favorite meat, duck confit.  I was actually a little bit disappointed with some of the duck being a little bit too dry, but overall the dish was 5 stars, at this point any criticisms are quibbling over trivial details Now for the two rave reviewed apps that were really unimpressive compared to the rest.  I wasn't impressed with the melted basque or the polenta.  They were both filling and tasty, but neither really showed a level of mastery of subtlety or cooking talent like the other dishes.   They get a solid 3 stars for simple appeal but nothing out of the ordinary, and certainly not particularly good value at the price

I love this restaurant and will come back as many times as is possible. The menu is really fantastic, it showcases many labor intensive dishes like head cheese, duck confit and braised meats, which I loved. My boyfriend and I ordered 4 appetizers to share (which was a LOT of food). The menu changes with the season but below are some examples of what might be available. Head cheese: If you're up for a tasty adventure I would highly recommend this. The head of a pig is essentially stewed, baked and left to coagulate and what is produced is an intensely succulent and tender meat. This one tasted a bit relish-y, which I liked. The poutine is really wonderful: crispy fries, yummy oxtail and aged cheddar. Wow. Barbecued Pork Belly Sandwiches: a must if you come to this restaurant, you have to taste it to believe something this divine could exist. The restaurant isn't very welcoming but it is very efficiently set up to accommodate a large number of people. Also the wine list is just OK... so I hate to do it but I really have to deduct one star for those two reasons.

They're slacking. Had a friend meet me and he wasn't impressed. I was kind of embarrassed at the fact that I hyped up the place and it wasn't up to par. Pork Belly - The kimchee "inspired" topping is more Thai than anything. Peanuts? Really? They need to authenticate the kimchee a little more. Poutine - Oxtail gravy & Cheddar - Just okay. My buddy claims it's popular in Europe and was nothing like anything he's had. More gravy and cheese without the meat. Soft Shell Crab, Pickled Green Tomato, Bacon, Aioli - Was probably one of the best FRIED soft shell crab, BUT! They ruined it with MAYO!!! Please put it on the side. Not everyone likes GLOBS of mayo. Didn't get to finish/ enjoy since the mayo covered half of the crab. Fish Dish - Forgot the name. It was AWESOME! Ceviche-esc with apples and jalapenos. We finished that one. Wine was nice and the unique sodas on the menu are a great touch.

This is a great spot to get some amazingly decadent food at reasonable prizes. Everything was delicious and absolutely overdone, which is what makes it great.  The decor was clean and neat with a very relaxed feel. We had the Petite Basque, BBQ Pork Belly Sandwiches, Poutine with Oxtail Gravy, Rabbit Loin, and the Bacon Chocolate Bar. The Pork Belly Sandwiches stole the show with a sublime melt-in-your-mouth texture and. I will definitely be back, but I'm going to need a steady diet of bland food over the next couple months to recover and prepare myself for the next experience. My one suggestions is that they work on their beer menu. It's pretty bland and they didn't have an IPA on the list. I'm not complaining about the Old Viscosity that we enjoyed, but I think that they could mix in a couple of nice domestic micro-brews and few Belgian beers that would really complement their food.

I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Animal. The decor is minimalistic, modern LA and I immediately felt at ease and able to converse and laugh the night away. Our food was deliciouso and our service from Jeff was also very great. +Basque (their most popular item) was PHENOM! +Grilled squid was really delish and not squishy or overly chewy. +Tried Sweet Breads for the first time here. I highly suggest it. Basically, the tastiest chicken nugget** I've ever had. +BBQ pork belly sandwiches right up my southern boy's alley +Amberjack ceviche was very tasty and flavorful reminded me of a less complex version Ken Oringer's ceviche at Toro. +Bacon crunch bar was confusing at first but after the second bite it made a lot more sense to my palate. +Tres Leches cake was soooo amazing and moist and perfect for my sweet tooth. I hate whip cream but the whip cream on this was awesome. We also ordered a fish entree but it wasn't as good as the others so I wouldn't recommend it. **server described it this way and I concur.

One word, the chef knows what the hell he is doing and knows his FOOD! This place is very unique and eccentric when it comes to food. Similar to Incanto in SF where they specialize in 'pig parts'. Located in the middle of fairfax in LA sort of haight ashbury like esq, we got reservations at 8:30pm and the restaurant was still packed. Shows why the hostess called us a total of 3 times to reconfrim our reservations! The restaurant is small, with a minimalistic design to it. Service was good friendly and prompt. We ordered: Head cheese sweetbreads fried pigs ear with fried egg fried crispy fatty pork sliders fried quail with honey grits and bacon spinach. Head cheese- not what i imagined but pleasantly surprised. I am not a huge fan of head cheese but if its good i will eat it. It came on a small plate and instead of it taking form like a thick terrine full of well, condensed pig parts it was sort of like a saucy condensed version of pate but more liquidy. It had some nice tang to it, through capers and some sort of relish/mustard. You could tell it was very fresh head cheese, freshly made probably hours before. clean tasting and satisfying. Sweetbreads- probably some of thebest sweetbreads I have ever had, and I hve had my share! It came with this yummy green sauce wtih morel mushrooms, pearl onions, other small root vegetables from what I recall and completely amazing. So good. I would get this again and again. Fried pigs ear iwth fried egg- we wanted to try the pig tails but the server convinced us this was the dish to get. Having eaten my share of pigs ear at taiwanese places i didnt think i would be wowed by this. It was crispy fried pig ears with a really tangy spicy sauce, and with the fried egg and partially runny egg yolk mixed into the fried strips just made it over the top. Cruchy, tangy, salty, creamy, it just worked so well. u know that the chef knows how to cook after you eat this! Fried crispy fatty pork sliders- man this was good. i didnt have high hopes for it but after the first bite I couldnt stop eating it. The fatty pork was perfectly cooked, half meat  half fat, top was crispy, inside melt in your mouth. the bun paired with it was perfection and coleslaw was a excellent compliment. If I ate this everyday I would be in heaven! Fried quail with honey grits. This was our 2nd dish and I almost licked the plate. The quail was so yummy, crunchy, and paired with the honey grits i almost licked the plate. Nough said! Overall and very unique culinary experience, and although each course is small the content is fatty and that made us REALLY FULL. A must stop for all foodies in LA.

Yummy, this place was awesome. We started with the Grilled Short-rib, Melted Petit Basque, Rabbit loin. All of these dishes were amazing, the short-rib was super tender, and the rabbit loin was just delicious. The Petit Basque was cheesy goodness. We followed that with the Ling Cod, and Foie gras loco moco, which both were off the hook good, i loved the foodie take on a Hawaiian plate meal. And we finished our meal with some Pound cake and the much hyped(and rightfully so) Bacon chocolate crunch. Everything was delicious. I really love how there are familiar flavors like Tabasco and Soy Sauce with ingrediets that are more regal and upscale like foie gras. It's make the food more fun when when it's highend with  the familiarity you know. The service was good too. The ambiance perfect. I am a fan of places that don't use signage, yet are packed with people. I have no complaints. Can't wait to go back for more, i wish i had the stomach(and the budget) to eat the whole menu.

Pork belly with Kimchi was off the hook, ribs size of God, ox tail poutines,Flat Iron steak with balsamic mushroom sauce, pound cake to die for. We had party of 3 and were so stuff we couldn't walk straight. Amazing meal, highly recommanded! Oh and to the cute sassy waitress, our table had a crush on you. Thanks for sharing our ribs and beer!

Is it possible that Animal was even better the 2nd time around? Unfortunately, last night's order of Joe's Donuts' caramel was a little burnt. So sad... It really prevented me from housing it all down. But... I found a new love. The Tres Leches. I had it at the restaurant... Loved it SO much, I had to order another one to take home.

It's called Animal and they're not apologetic about serving deliciously prepared animals of every kind.  Sat next to a guy at the bar that looked like he was having sex with the pork belly sliders.  the noises he was making and the eye rolling back was a bit much but I did order the sliders just in case.  they were tasty. :-) so far I've tried the: flat iron steak, poutine, foie gras and biscuit with a ridiculously good gravy something with chorizo - love it! the broccoli thing is alright gnocchi was good but not like the other items on the menu and everything on the dessert menu is awesome oh and good wine list.   I still can't believe some of the reviews.  Question 1:  Why would a vegetarian go to a restaurant called "Animal"?  Question 2:  why are you a vegetarian???

food: animal gets 4.5 stars.  the food was awesome.  every dish was perfectly prepared, simple yet complex in flavor.  i'm personally a fan (and can be very critical of how it's prepared) of the crazy stuff (like pig ears, bone marrow, chicken liver, etc).  my faves at animal include bone marrow with chimichurri, pig ears, hamachi tostada, pork belly sliders and thai bbq quail. service: nice and friendly.  only pet peeve was...our server wasn't very knowledgeable of the wine menu and couldn't really explain much final thoughts: really great :)

The food was BEYOND amazing. I only ate the quail because I everything else had peanuts, shell fish, or pig. But best tasting quail I have ever had. But the only down side is the portions I paid $19 for  something that was the size of 3 tiny chicken wings and diced apples. And I paid $15-20 for four sauteed pig tails for my boyfriend and they looked like they were size of bagel bites. It would have been cool having larger side dishes. Seriously I have never left a restaurant STARVING. I would have needed to eat like 3 of those and then some to be satisfied. The place is really snobby, they wouldn't seat my friends until we got there & they threatened to take away our reservations after my boyfriend and i were a few minutes late. All I can say is that we would have found the place if there valet sign was bigger and they had sign. Sorry to give such negative comments, but if you want a pricey snack or an extremely light meal the food is seriously OFF THE HOOK! And you should try it. Oh and the last thing I have to say is they do not split the check so if you come with a group bring cash. My check was $47.00 and on my credit card statement it was $56.60. I don't really care it's just $10 but that's pretty shady.

Went here on a wednesday night recently and it was super busy.  Usually places are only busy on a wednesday if its trendy or great food.  Well I think this one may be both.  Our starters were the veal tongue with smoked foie gras, hamachi crudo tostada, and polenta with bolognese.  Then we split the sturgeon.  They were all so amazingly good its hard to choose a favorite.  The hamachi was probably my favorite.  It was a crispy corn tortilla with thinly sliced raw yellowtail and topped with a kind of cabbage slaw with tangy fish sauce and lime, crispy fried onions, and peanuts.  It was like mexican vietnamese fusion and I want another right now.  The polenta bolognese was near perfect as well.  The texture of the polenta isnt the kind I like which is usually more coarse grains, but it was kinda fine ground and smooth.  However it was super buttery and delicious and the bolognese was textbook example of what good bolognese should be.  The veal tongue was not what I expected at all but it was super good as well.  It was almost like ham that had been caramelized in a pan and the foie gras was a kind of mousse.  Also on the plate was a mustard sauce and the combination of the three was really nice.  The sturgeon was cooked perfectly and the kabocha squash while a bit greasy, was delicious as well.  This is a small place and gets packed so talking was a bit of a challenge at first, then the big party next to us left and it got a bit quieter.  The service was top notch, since we were asked two more times if we needed water after the server left to get it for us.  We didnt really wait for anything and the only time I needed to flag someone down was when I realized I had a knife but no fork.  Not sure if i knocked it off or it was forgotten but the lady I asked had a new fork in her apron so I was quickly back in business.  I love it when they are prepared.  So yeah make a reservation and go to town.  Anyone that loves creative well prepared food would be delighted with this spot.

My group partook at Animal with different expectations.  I for one drooled over the much appreciated photos, which helped me decide in advance what I wanted to order.  However, I read that the menu changes daily so I expected to be disappointed.  Lucky for me, the same menu I reviewed on their website was what they were serving that evening.  Yay. Between the three of us, we ordered 5 appetizers, 1 entree, and 2 desserts.  Be forewarned, the portions are on the smaller side, tapas style.  Since they were so small, we decided to share everything.  Animal is not a stuffy establishment where you feel uncomfortable to do this. If you eat any of the components by itself, its only mediocre.  However, when you eat them all together as intended, its creative and bold.  I must really compliment the chefs on their perfect execution of the pork dishes.  The pork dishes were truly the highlight of my meal.   It would take forever to describe each of the eight dishes I tried that evening.  I feel confident if you order a variety, you wont be disappointed.   For dessert though, I was a little disappointed with the bacon-chocolate crunch bar.  I guess it just wasn't what I imagined.  I thought there would actually be a strip of bacon or something.  Oh well.  Eat the tres leches cake instead, very good.

The most apt description for Animal I could think of: Gourmet Stoner Food And I do mean that in the best way possible.  Animal combines rich dishes and flavor profiles that in theory shouldn't work, but they do.  "Dude.. you know what would rule with this foie gras?  A rich-ass buttery biscuit.  NO NO.. wait, a biscuit AND GRAVY.  Ha ha."  "Dude, what if we put maple syrup and SAUSAGE into our gravy?!"  "TOTALLY RADICAL!!" Of course that philosophy doesn't occur in all of their dishes, just the best ones.  It's the reason why Los Angeles is blessed with Animal's poutine, crispy hominy, pork belly, and locco moco.  Thank you Animal and the occasionally blazed pioneering spirit!

How this place has only 4 stars boggles my mind.  I have officially tried EVERYTHING on the menu and this is my favorite (accessible) restaurant in Los Angeles.  Well, I've tried it all except the desserts because I'm too full by the time we're supposed to order them. If you are having a hard time finding them, they are located right across the street, and slightly north (like 20 feet) from Golden State burgers (another place I'd definitely recommend).  They have no store front sign and its just plain black.  The crosswalk leads you directly there. Everything is good and they provide some GREAT portions.  Main courses, stick with the Foie Gras entree and the Rib-eye, but remember, the Rib-eye is HUGE.   Order the Yellowtail Tostada, Pork Belly Sandwiches, Crab Legs, Marrow Bone, Beet Salad, Pig Ear, Baby Broccoli, Chicken Liver Toast, Duck Confit, and Foie Gras for appetizers... at least.  Everything else you can order at your own hearts desire.  Trust me, when it comes to food, my mouth knows best - and it has possessed the fingers in my hands to type this truth. Animal, I love thee.

Ummmm...PFFFFFF!!!! Delicious!! If you've never been, I suggest you should! There's so many things on the menu, but this is what I got: I started out with the chicken liver...not a liver fan, but I had to try it and be brave...so now, well, I love it! Just this one, because of how the caramalized onions balanced out the strong flavor of the liver. Second: The Pork Belly...YUUUUMMY!! If you want to cheat from your daily healthy eating, then try this, if not, stick with the salad! Third: Hamachi Tostada!! The cilantro, lime, cabbage, the tender hamachi with the crunch of the tostada...mmmmmmmmm!!! Lastly...desert...Tres Leche!!! Heaven!!! When I took my first bite, I literally wanted to knock the wine glasses off the table!! Delicious!! So.. in closing.. I'll meet you all there.. oh make your reservation a week in advance, or get there when they open and sit at the bar, cause they get pretty busy.

The food is good, don't get me wrong. But too much is too much and something about this place is just socially irresponsible. The food is fat fried in butter, topped with oil. I wanted to vomit after 2 courses. But I can see how it can be fun, eating essentially junk food served in a cool environment. The staff incredibly nice- I mean SUPER nice. No LA attitude at all. I get the sense that they really love what they do, which is great! Since I value my life, I don't anticipate ever going again. But it was an experience, for sure.

I was impressed right off the bat when I arrived at peak dinner time without a reservation.  No tables available so the hostess walked around and noticed that people were leaving at the bar. She then told me she would seat me as soon as it was free.  I wandered away and she came to find me to make sure we got the seats!  Such a sweetie!  The rest of the staff was equally friendly and knowledgeable about the food. As for the food, the name says it all.  While the menu is very carnivore centric, this places doesn't go over the top. The food is sooo well done!   After am initial hesitation about the porkbelly sammies (not a big fan of bbq sauce), it quickly became my favorite item that evening. This was not like any bbq sandwich i'd ever had and the creaminess of the slaw was the perfect balance to the tartness.  The quail was very tender given how small those things are.  We also had the asparagus which was good but a bit too tart for me. Great relaxed atmosphere as well with simple, clean decor.  Another bonus - parking before 7pm. This stretch of Fairfax isn't jammed with trendy shops and restaurants yet. I have nothing bad to say about this place at all - from the wait staff to the food to the decor.  It was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a while.

This place doesn't have a sign.  So the only way you know that it's actually animal is from the address.  It's too cool to have a sign, ya know? Nice and attentive servers, dim lighting, very happening scene.  We had a table of trannie wannabes to the right and then a cougar table to the left, it was all so LA...   As for the food, it's quite unique.  You won't  find cuisine like this elsewhere.  The Grilled octopus was well seasoned and tender.  The poutine was better then I expected..fries with oxtail stew is delicious! Had the flat iron steak for my entree, it was just OK.  I was sorta of full from the starters, so winded up taking most of the steak home. I don't think i would have come here, if it weren't for a friend making the reservation.  I'm not an adventurous eater, but it was great to try something different and for the scene.

We took my father here last week and everyone had a good time. Highlights were the hamachi tostada, smoked trout salad, pork belly sandwich (which didn't need as much bbq sauce as it had), um.. the uni... we ate a lot. This food is very rich! Watch out for a food hangover (I got sick, no kidding, but you can probably handle it). The root beer is good, and so was the one pilsner on the menu.

This place is just an experience unlike any other. If you enjoy all things meat, you have to go! The pork belly sliders, pork ribs, rabbit spring rolls, everything is unbelievable. It is small plates so order lots of things to share with a group. While foie gras tends to offend some, it really is a treat. We tried 7 dishes between three of us, were stuffed to the gills, but loved every bite. Veggie lovers need not apply. For a carnivorous feast like no other, this place is aces.

All About The Appetizers! We came about 7:30 on a Saturday with no reservations and were seated right away.  Began with a glass of Valpolicella at 12 bones, which I thought was a bit steep.  Also, had the mint tea which came in a good-looking glass pot loaded with nothing but hot water and fresh mint leaves.   On our waiter's recommendation for two people, we ordered 3 appetizers , 1 entree, and one dessert.  We started with the Ricotta & Goat Cheese Gnocchi, Squid with Chimichurri, and BBQ Pork Sliders with Cole Slaw.  Our entree was the Quail Fry with greens and grits.  We ended the meal with the Panna Cotta. The Squid was presented beautifully on a white plate with five pieces in a row, but was not fresh.  The dish also had diced potato and some corn, which added to the overall flavor.  The BBQ Pork Sliders came with good cuts of pork, a spicy barbecue sauce, and cole slaw between a small brioche - better if they used another bread that is not so soft and buttery that falls apart.  The Gnocchi was cooked too long, so it was too mushy.  The tomato and basil sauce was bland. The Quail Fry was basically like fried chicken.  In fact, it should have been fried chicken at a fraction of the price since they fried it.  Seems  like anything fried takes on the flavor of the oil it is cooked in.  The bird  was covered in a crispy, golden batter which helped.  The maple sauce was a delicious accompaniment to a salty, savory dish.  The grits were very good and the greens were good, but there were only two bites. The Panna Cotta was very soft with an interesting sauce.  The flavor was delicious, though.   Our bill came out to just under 100 bucks excluding tip.  Service was average, but I heard they were not expecting a big crowd for the holiday weekend.  It was a bit annoying that our table was right next to the thermostat, so they came over about 4 times to adjust it.  Yes, the ambience is lacking any sort of visual appeal and I was lucky to get a street spot for parking.  Parking looks like it could be trouble, since I did not see a valet on a Saturday night.

It takes a lot for me to want to complain, but this dining experience was absurd.  My friend decided to take me out for my bday.  We made an 8:30 PM reservation.  Once we got there we waited for a table till a little after 9:30  PM.  They sat us at a bench outside and told us that the table on the other side of the glass would be ours.  We watched the group take there sweet ass time and finished off their 9 desserts.   Once seated our waiter neglected to come over.  Eventually someone asked us if we would like some wine.  We were lucky enough to get our food order within 20 mins after we placed an order for one appetizer.  35 mins passed and each table around us seemed to have started their meals, BUT US.  THEY LOST OUR FOOD TICKET!  We didn't get our food till after 10 PM on an 8:30 PM reservation.   My dish was soaked in sauce to the point it was making me sick while the desserts were underwhelming.  They did comp us about $50 worth of wine, but overall Animal left a bad taste in my mouth.

Everything was perfect. I went with my gf and some friends. We decided to share everything so we could get a variety and really get an idea of the flavor of the menu. I wasn't disappointed by a single thing. The poutine is basically a glorified chili cheese fries. But my god. First time i've ever had ox tail but i hope its not the last. The crispy pig ear was also a first and delicious. Had great texture and was almost too spicy, but not enough to stop any of us from cleaning the plate. We also ordered the chicken liver toast, the lamb chops, pork belly agnolotti, and the squid (which tasted unlike any other squid i've ever had...texture and flavor was closer to a peppered jerky) The halibut was rich and buttery, but not overly done. My friend ordered the balsamic pork ribs which were spilling off of the plate and onto the table. It wasn't drowned in sauce, but was still so full of flavor. My gf had the steak and loved the truffle parmesan fondue sauce that came with it. The pork chop was cooked perfectly. flavorful and not too chewy. Out of the desserts i enjoyed the tres leches the most. The bacon chocolate crunch bar was okay. But the bacon was a little too overpowering. When i get the budget, i'll definitely be returning to animal.

When I saw an entree here of foie gras/quail egg/spam/hamburger, I knew it was going to be good, but I didn't know what I signed up for. The sauce on this thing was beyond crack sauce. There was so much flavor I nearly collapsed. My boyfriend's dish was very good (duck), too. I wish I lived in la so I could eat here everyday.

I've had this place on my bookmark FOREEEEEVER and finally , I got my chance the other evening.  We didn't make rsvps til the day of our dinner LOL but we still got a table for 9:45pm. Now usually I don't like starting dinner that late, but who cares, we were staying in Hollyweird and knew we were going to have a loooong night.   So taxi'd our way over and got there a little early. While we waited we had some wine outside, also while we were outside I saw the latest Top chef and his brother coming out, I wonder what their take of animal was . We were seated , I think on time LOL. The ambiance in here is nice and dark and typical LA eatery, where you can literally eat your neighbors food. Our waiter was good and attentive.     So we started with the pig tails made buffalo style. OH MAN, that sauce woke me up and my taste buds. Those were good, I love the crisp and fattiness of the tails. I recommend you eat them like ribs, you gotta get your hands dirty with this dish. Im ordering that again! We shared both main courses. Had the rabbit legs made with mustard, bacon, english peas and black trumpet . The meat was beyond tender and the sauce was great. Nice thick pieces of bacon nomy nom nom nooooooom  I never had rabbit before and it looks like I will be eat thumpers more often, if I see it on the menu. Second main course we had was the foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy. This is one of the richest dishes I ever eaten. Another first for me, was having Foie gras. I enjoyed it very much, everything  yet again was perfect. The gravy was perfect and smooth with yummy bites of sausage. I will say, they could have used a lighter hand on that maple drizzle. It made this dish almost like dessert than a savory dish.  For dessert we had the tres leches  and the bacon chocolate  crunch bar. That tres leches was the melt in my mouth and that top frosting was light and sweet in the same sense, didn't taste heavy at all. That chocolate bacon crunch bar, was a bit too much for tastes, but thats ok because the PIC was all over that.      I can't wait to come back here and scale that menu, so many options. Im already have Animal withdrawls :(

After a delicious experience at Son of a Gun, I was looking forward to a visit to Animal.  There is no signage, so drive slowly when nearing the appropriate address.  Meat takes the stage, although there are also a few fish dishes, and for the adventurous, items like pig tails, pig ears, and veal brains.     We started off with the hamachi tostada with fish sauce, vinagrette and peanut.  The flavors were vibrant especially with lime.  The fish was delicate and fresh, and the tortilla thin and crisp.        Next was the alaskan halibut with corn, russian kale, and green garlic.  Also, a light but pleasing dish.      This was followed by our favorite for the evening, the poutine with oxtail gravy and aged cheddar.  The fries were crispy and held up to the weight of the gravy.  The oxtail is fork tender and the gravy is more like a stew and is not at all salty, which sometimes can occur with reduction sauces.  I remember going for fries and gravy after football games in high school, but it was nothing like this.  A true gourmet comfort dish.       We finished with the bbq pork belly sandwiches with coleslaw.  Very tender pork in a tangy bbq sauce with a little coleslaw in a soft bun.  Simple goodness that you will be able to finish it off in a few bites.      I was not impressed by the dessert which was berries, vanilla custard with lavender crumble and opal basil.  The crumble component did not exude lavender, and reminded me of overcooked cookies that had been broken apart on top of the custard.  It might have been better without the crumble and as a custard.      Everytime I see chefs Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo (Food and Wine best new chefs 2009) at various food events, it makes me smile.  They met in culinary school and then worked at three restaurants together.  It is so great that lifelong friends share a passion for food.  The names of their restaurants are telling of a playful side to their cooking.  There is also a "friends of Animal" page on the website, which is such a cute idea.  I hope their empire continues to expand

Given that the food here is amazing but still very affordable, we were wondering how this place made any money.  Until we realized that the bottle of wine we ordered had been marked up 100%.   We'd certainly go back, but we'll bring our own bottle and pay the $20 corkage fee.

After hearing so much about Animal and reading up on the restaurant I finally had the opportunity to dine there. I went to Animal with a group of friends (couple of whom had already dinned and Animal and raved about it) the other night and was truly blown away by the entire experience and of course the amazing food. As we were all looking through the menu, trying to decide what to order, I was happily overwhelmed with the variety of different menu items. I had been informed that the Foie Gras Loco Moco, the BBQ Pork Belly Sandwiches, and the bacon chocolate crunch bars were some the must order items on the menu and of course between the seven of us that went we managed to order those and so much more. The foie gras literally just melts in your mouth and the pork belly sandwiches were truly phenomenal. It was such a treat to be able to order almost everything on the menu, between all of us,  and sample a little of each. Even though the plate portions are small plate style we were able to walk out of the restaurant feeling satisfied and excited for the next time we could go back to Animal. The restaurants decor is very simple and clean. The minimal decorations, upscale tavern tables, and refined industrial look makes the dinner focus on what they are really there for: the food. I only have great things to say about the restaurant, the chef. I advise that anyone looking for a new and laid back dinning experience in Los Angeles  must immediately make reservations to dine at Animal! It is an experience every food lover must have. I cant wait to go back!

There is not a doubt in my mind that this is a top five restaurant in Los Angeles. It's a treasure. The cuisine is simply mind blowing at times. My wife and I cannot leave this place without eating between four and six courses. I hated Poutin until I had Animal's. BBQ Pork Belly Sliders will melt in your mouth, Balsamic Ribs are fall off the bone, and the Loco Moco is just an insane combination of hearty goodness. If you are a foodie, and you have not sat down at Animal, you should be ashamed of yourself.

We went without a reservation and were able to get a seat at the bar, but i must suggest that if you are planning to give this place a try book in advance. I had the Foie Gras which i would say is passable but not the best that i've had. But good. The portions are small but in an establishment such as this it is what you should expect. So long as the dish is good size does not matter. I'm guessing that they are going more for the the romantic feel with the dark lighting but the acoustics weren't the best leaving it difficult at times to hear the person you are with. The hostess did seem a little flustered and in an establishment such as this could have composed herself a little better but was cordial and quickly got us a seat at the bar. The wait staff or bar staff i should say provided us with some useful tips and knew the menu well. Nothing unlike what i would expect from a restaurant in this price range though. It's worth a try but do make a reservation and definitely try the desert

this being review #875, you will likely find nothing new in my words.  well, screw you.  this place is too good to not write about. parking: valet, $5. staff: busy but attentive, well informed. space: small but not tiny. cool that they don't jam their tables together. drinks: sorry, i'm on the wagon for 3 months, but my buddy really enjoyed the beer selection they had. ... and ... the food... it's been so long since i've been so surprised and pleased with a dining experience.  even though i have been putting off this place and building up expectations for over  a year, i was overjoyed. my favorites were the chicken liver toast, the hamachi tostada and the marrow with chimichurri.  this is the first time i really enjoyed marrow, having tried it at several other places, including Mozza.  here vs. everywhere else, it didn't have that scummy film that marrow usually leaves in your mouth; it was meatier, but lighter and well balanced with the Argentinian spices. enjoyed but wouldn't order again: the veal brain and lamb neck. the former was, well... it was brain.  i thought it wasn't a big deal, and i ate several bites and i didn't get sick, but i couldn't quite get over the cultural phobia.  the lamb neck was fine, but compared to everything else it was just another dish. oh yeah, the rabbit legs... the meat fell off the bone. what makes this dish is the yogurt sauce... creamy, fresh and tangy, served with super crunchy snow peas and radish slices - crazy good. vege-what?

After looking at the menu on their website, I was excited to try this place out.  Overall, it delivered. We shared several dishes.  The fried rabbit legs were wonderful.  Perfectly crisp, and more tender than any rabbit I've ever had.  and their basque cheese with chorizo was a great take on Queso fundido.  The chorizo was sliced rather than crumbled, and I'm not sure how I felt about that.  It was hard to apportion the right meat-to-cheese-to-bread ratio.  But the sausage was flavorable (favorable and flavorful) and not too greasy. But the other two dishes left me wanting a bit, both for the same reason, they didn't let the food speak for itself. I loved their idea of making sliders with pork-belly, which, let's face it, is porcine ambrosia.  But they covered it with a tangy BBQ that completely overpowered the beauty of my favorite slop-eating animal.  Pork belly should be perfectly cooked, lightly salted and seasoned, then allowed to wow you on it's own.  Crunchy on the outside, melty in the middle, with a little chewy meatiness.  How could you even tell when having to bite through the sticky sweet coating?  It might as well have been a hunk of picnic roast. Same with the marrow bone.  How could I even get the flavor out of the bone when it was covered by chimichurri?  I'll admit, that was some DAMN tasty chimichurri, though.  But I preferred to eat it serperately from the marrow, as neither of the tastes needed anything to go with them. Our server was courteous, quick and attentive, maybe a little too friendly, but who can blame her?  I'm a charming patron. My last "boo" came when it was time for dessert.  Man, that toffee pudding sounds great right?  OUT!  Not a scrap of toffee in the house.  Bunch of teases.

I must agree with Felicia C. This place is certainly not vegetarian friendly. But that's not why it is only four stars. The carniverous friends said the food was amazing. They loved the Loco Moco, Belly Burgers, Oxtail Gravy Chili Fries, Flat Iron Steaks... the desserts were AMAZING, I loved the jar of pudding, and the strawberry shortcake was indescribably delish. The hostess was uber nice, with impeccable manners. However, our waiter could not remember our orders and he just seemed like he did not know what was going on (minus one star). The atmosphere was perfect, you cannot beat this quaint restaurant that actually serves great food. Again, if you're veg, best of luck. They don't amend the dishes, period. Sorry.

Wow. This place has been on my list to go to for a while now and it did not disappoint. Animal has more starter portions than main courses and I'd recommend you go with a large group and really do everything family style. There were just 2 of us, so we got the pigs ear and foie gras with biscuits along with the pork ribs. Everything was delicious! The pigs ear has a spicy sauce on it that provides a good kick, but the lime in the sauce balances the heat. It definitely is spicy though, so if you don't like your food with heat, don't get it. The ear itself is shredded, fried and crispy and it's served topped with an egg. I've never had anything quite like it - highly recommended! The foie gras is another delicious dish. Served on a biscuit and topped with sweet maple gravy mixed with sausage. The flavors are layered and amazing. The sauce on the pork ribs is a balsamic based tangy sauce. I only wish I had more of it. Unfortunately by the time we got to the ribs, we were already so full that we couldn't finish it all. The service was perfect. Our waiter was friendly and he brought the dishes one at a time with a good break in between. Too many restaurants rush the meal and I really appreciated the slow pace at which Animal allowed me to enjoy mine. Along with a carafe of wine, the tab came to $100 which was very reasonable. Not sure I can eat here that often, the food was very rich, but I was very impressed with everything.

This will be a short review since it's been a while since I ate there... Great food and great service! This is the place for meat lovers!!! I enjoyed all the recommendations that our waiter gave us. My roommate and I shared two dishes and a desert. The servings are pretty small so I suggest doing it family since each dish offers something unique to the taste buds. The foie gras was amazing, that's all I can say!!! For desert, my friend wanted to try the bacon crunch bar. It was a bit too sweet for me and to my surprise the bacon bits didn't gross me out because I couldn't really taste the bacon. And  yes I felt really guilty since I was eating two fatty food combined: chocolate and bacon! I will definitely go back! It's just I need to remember where it is because there is no sign in front and parking can be a hassle! I guess that' works for certain people since if you park further away, you can walk off the fat/calories you gained after eating way too much meat.

I have to start off by saying I have the greatest boss ever. Who else's boss takes them out for an amazing meal to celebrate my switching to part time only? I love my boss. I'm rounding up from what I'd call a 4.75-star experience. Let me get my only complaints out front: 1. if you have food allergies, DON'T order something with said allergic item - the chef will not substitute/remove ANYTHING, we found this out the hard way. No, we didn't eat it and die, we made up an allergy to get rid of something on a dish, and failed. 2. Others have said the servers are very intuitive about bringing courses out in an order that makes the meal more enjoyable - lighter to heavier items. They brought out our petit basque and trout salad at the same time - why is this an issue? of course you're going to eat the hot bubbling cheese first while it's hot, but then after that insanely rich, savory, creamy, sweet delight, the trout ends up tasting freakishly tart, salty, and.... fishy. I think the trout, which was brilliantly complex and delicate and delicious by the last 2 bites when the cheese taste had worn off,  would have been better enjoyed first, without the basque sitting there bubbling away. not very intuitive... That said, the food is brilliant and wicked and satisfying and artery-clogging and coma-inducing heaven. this review is mostly written from the point of view of my tongue... Petit basque - sheep's milk cheese is the perfect mixture of clean creaminess and heady salty flavor (since I don't like goat cheese or bleu/stinky cheeses). Layer it over caramelized onions and thinly sliced chorizo and bake it and spread it all on crostini? oh hell. this is something i'm going to crave on a daily freaking basis now. i had ordered a riesling, and i was shocked how well it paired with this. the cheese and onions really brings out an amazingly deep flavor in the riesling - really cuts the sweetness just right. smoked trout salad - complete opposite of basque dish, this is light, bright, complex, acidic.... like your tongue is running through the sprinklers on a hot summer day with a popsicle. you must build your perfect bite - get a hunk of trout with a bit of everything on it - dressing, corn, avocado, radicchio, nestled on an arugula leaf. your tongue will dance through the mixture of flavors the whole time you're chewing! please take my advice and eat this before any massively cheesy/meaty items, your tongue will thank you for not jarring it out of "mm cheese" mode. oh, and unless you enjoy a fish cracker, avoid the skin. Pork belly sliders - fan-freaking-tastic. they lived up to all the hype, which is rare. the bun is a super soft, buttery brioche roll, holding 2 huge hunks of barbecue pork belly dripping sauce and falling apart. the fatty melty pieces pretty much made love to my tongue... and the slaw is great, balancing the pork belly just right. i could easily eat like 20 of these, but then i'd probably drop dead instantaneously. my boss joked that 3 minutes after she finished hers, she discovered a new zit. seriously, it's possible... quail fry - I've never eaten such a tiny bird before, but man was it tasty! soo moist and juicy and tastes better than any fried chicken i've had. the batter is perfectly crunchy and light. again, build little bites with grits and greens - the combination will blow your tongue's little mind. flat iron steak - i would say one of my favorite foods is a great steak, and this is a great steak. because the waitress told us the chef tends to go rare, we ordered it a medium, and it came out a glorious medium to medium rare pink juicyness - just past bloody, but still pink as hell. the steak fairly melted in my mouth, all buttery and just the tiniest bit of chewy texture (which i like in a steak) and had all the real, beefy flavor that you want when you crave a slab of cow. best steak i've had in years, and that includes my STK ribeye. who knew? again with the perfect bite - stack on pieces of the artichoke hash with parmesan sauce - insane. this is why i felt like rolling down the sidewalk after - couldn't stop eating the steak. bonus - my steak knife was engraved with "The Wrangler" - what better name for a steak knife :) to top it off, we had to try the bacon chocolate dessert. the main part of this has a great dark chocolate ganache/truffle filling taste and texture, which i love because it wasn't too sweet. the bacon adds just a bit of salty finish to each bite that allows you to keep eating it without getting "sweeted out". definitely worth trying at least once. Definitely a meal I won't forget. i can't wait to try everything else here, especially the foie gras appetizer and balsamic pork ribs - although it probably won't be for a very long time :) i feel like i need to eat lettuce and fruit for the next month to cleanse my body!

4 Stars Oh Animal, Oh Animal, Thy Food is so delicious! Yes this place did live up to the hype. Our reservations were for 6:45, we arrived about ten minutes early and were seated immediately. The restaurant was about 80% full. Our server explained to us the different ways we could order, all apps, no apps, a lot of apps and entrees, etc...But we had to make sure to order all at once versus piece meal. That wouldn't be a problem. We ordered a bottle of the house Cabernet to start and perused the menu. We decided to go heavy on the apps and split an entree. For our apps we had the Chicken Liver Toast, BBQ Pork Belly Sliders, Melted Petit Basque and Chorizo, Sweetbreads, Poutine and the Pig Ear with Fried Egg. The Chicken Liver Toast was amazing, so simple, but so well balanced. The liver puree was so smooth. The BBQ Pork Sliders were good, but there was too much sauce for my taste. The pork belly was so unctuous and the slaw was not too sweet. Melted Petit Basque was not bad, but the flavor of the Chorizo was lost. The Sweetbreads were amazing, it was served on top of creamed spinach, with Hen of the Woods mushrooms, capers and lemon segments. When everything was eaten together there were so many flavors that all worked well together. The Pig Ear with Fried egg had a nice spice, but the pig ears could have been a little crispier. The Poutine was the only dish that I thought was unsuccessful. It was too salty and I thought the gravy was too thin. For our entree we decided to split the Quail Fry. Another well executed dish. The crispy fried quail went well with the slab bacon and creamy grits. The quail was cooked perfectly. I was looking forward to the donuts for dessert, but they taken them off the menu. We ordered the Bacon Chocolate Crunch bar. It was nice and chocolaty, but the bacon part of it just brought a little smokyness no bacon flavor. Animal is casual and the atmosphere is very minimal. The service was excellent and the price is not bad. The standout dishes were the Chicken Liver Toast, Sweetbreads, and Quail Fry. I hope to go back and try some of the other dishes soon.

With this many good reviews on Yelp, http://chow.com and a completely booked reservation list, I figured this place had to be good. I went in at 6PM and they told us they were booked for 2 days straight. Luckily, there was plenty of room at the bar. This place is NOT cheap, the meal cost me $45 total and neither I nor my companion were full. Portions are modest, so order as much as you can afford. Where is the option for 20 stars?!!! The food expensive but it is worth every penny. BBQ pork belly sliders: This is a MUST ORDER. Imagine the most tender cuts of pork, drizzled with bbq sauce, topped with cool cole slaw, stuck between the two of the most buttery, luscious buns you have ever had. It was a life-changing experience biting into one for the first time. Each order comes with two sandwiches. One word, INCREDIBLE!!! Veal fillet: This dish was expensive but amazing. I will explain the dish layer by layer. The top layer is two pieces of crispy bacon, which tasted like they were made fresh in house. Next is the veal fillet, drenched in a raspberry sauce with greens sprinkled liberally. The meat was a little crispy on the outside and super tender inside. Finally is a bed of mashed potatoes and artichoke hearts.

What a great dinner! Carrot salad - Crisp and refreshing. Blends together very well and the creamy avocado offsets everything that's crunchy in the salad. Roasted Marrow Bone - I coulda eaten this all by myself. Bone's hot, so be careful if you're trying to hold it down. I love chimmi churri, so I coulda been biased. I also love perfectly buttered toast. Sweetbreads - Didn't know what it was. Apparently it's the thymus gland. The sweetbreads was fried up and tasted (and looked like) like chicken nuggets. Pork Belly Sandwich - What everybody else has been saying. This thing is *** good. I felt super guilty eating it cuz you know there's heavenly chunks of fat in that sandwich. Flat iron - least impressive dish of the night. You can probably skip this and get something more adventurous. Tres Leches - Love it. Soaked just right and melts in your mouth.

This was my first foray into haute cuisine, and I gotta say...I was fucking impressed. For my party of five (oh man...old school show...), the waiter suggested 7 appetizers and 2 entrees, plus a dessert, which ended up being a perfect amount for all of us. To be honest, the total amount of food I ate was probably not as much as I've eaten in the past, but the sheer richness and fattiness of so many of the dishes made it so that I just could not utterly stuff myself. First off, I tried Foie Gras for the first time. And it was the most delicious piece of food I have ever eaten in my entire life. SO JUICY, so much flavor, just melt in your mouth goodness. The BBQ pork belly sandwiches were just as delicious. A huge chunk of meat, tons of delicious fat, and cooked just right so the meat just fell apart in your mouth. I absolutely loved it. This was also my first time trying sweetbread, which was also omg freaking amazing. It was not as soft and smooth as the fatty meat, was a bit granier, but still tasted absolutely delicious. And finally, the poutine, with oxtail and gravy, was awesome. The oxtail was meaty, tender, went awesome with the gravy, and add in some crispy fries, and you have yourself a heart-stopping plate of goodness. The other appetizers we ordered were good, just not as spectacular. The rabbit loin with bacon just tasted like bacon with some dry chicken, BUT the sweet potato mash that came with it was heavenly. The hamachi was boring I thought, and the bone marrow that we got to spread on garlic bread was interesting, but I didn't actually taste anything except the bread. The entrees were pretty damn delicious. The meat on the crispy rabbit legs just FELL right off the bone, didn't even need a knife. The lemon aioli was great with it...almost felt like buffalo wings and blue cheese or ranch, but it was infinitely more delicious. And the flat iron steak was cooked medium rare, perfectly red in the middle, with the parmesan fondue on top that tasted awesome with the meat. Finally, we finished off with the bacon chocolate crunch bar. omg chocolatey goodness, with the crunchiness of bacon on top. The bacon bits felt kind of like those cookie crunches that you get on your carvel cake, except it was BACON. You barely tasted it over the chocolate, but it added a hint of savory bacony goodness to an intense rich chocolate cake. At $40 a person, this is definitely a place I will sparingly visit with out of town friends, and also to re-live that life-changing moment I had when I put my first piece of foie gras into my mouth.

My buddies (group of 5) and I had an 11:30pm reservation and was seated at around 11:40. We ordered the: Carrot salad - simple, light, sour and tangy. Unremarkable, but I think we were just excited for the meat that was coming up. hamachi tostada - it was topped with dill pickle and was nice an appetizer marrow bone - extremely rich and fatty, smeared on some butter toasts, really good. pig ear - crispy fried thin strips of ear, both spicy and sour, it wasn't my favorite. baby broccoli - the soft boiled egg and bacon bits gave this dish a lot of various textures, surprisingly tasty for a veggie-based dish barbeque pork belly sandwiches - 2 little sliders on butter toasted buns, I was expecting the pork belly to be a bit fattier, but there was more meat that I would have thought, the slaw added a nice crunch as a topping foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - this might have been my favorite dish, the foie gras was perfect, its richness carried over to the thick meaty gravy which was slathered over a soft biscuit, a genius dish fried soft-shell crab sandwich - this one was hard to share because the crab got smashed when we cut it, but the deep fried crab on toast was awesome, it was topped with a kind of thousand island-type dressing and was very flavorful foie gras loco moco burger - more foie gras = happy people, this burger was a hit with the group as well, egg on top of goose liver on top of grilled spam on top of a nice burger patty on top of a rich saucy rice. Outstanding. rib eye for two, escargot butter - We asked for this to be cooked rare-med/rare, we received it well done, we took a few bites and had to send it back, even when eaten with escargot and creamy mashed potatoes it was stringy and dry. This was unfortunate because we were all looking forward to this big hunk of meat and snails (which were buttery and tender). Our server provided awesome service though and took it off our bill and relayed the apologies from the chef.   tres leches - very rich and creamy cake, I would have attacked this slice of cake with my hands if we hadn't been out in public, I liked it a lot. panna cotta - this was a firm cream dessert with the consistency of flan, but I was told this was made without egg, very soft, sweet and delicious. Overall, I liked Animal a lot, and I wanted to give it 5 stars. But one thing everyone in my group agreed on was that every single dish (desserts excluded) was overly salty. The excellent flavor of the food was overwhelmed and masked by the saltiness of the various sauces, which is unfortunate because the food could have stood on its own without so much heavy sauce. Then there was the overcooked ribeye steak, the anticipated grand finale of our meal fell flat. Our server offered to cook us another one but it was around 1:00AM at the time and couldn't wait another hour for it to be prepared, so we were kinda bummed. Animal is the kind if restaurant you would visit just to try some new things. It doesn't strike me as a joint that you'd go to just for a regular meal or a casual dinner with friends. The items are pricey, the portions are small and the little establishment is always packed.

Holy crap, this place was good. Staff was really helpful and the food was fantastic. Had the basque and chorizo dip, pork belly sandwichs, fish tostada, ox poutin, pate toast, pig ear with egg, and the sweetbreads. Though all was splendid individually, the order of consumption is somewhat important. Sweetbreads AFTER poutin is NOT recommend!

I took my husband here for his birthday dinner last night and we both really enjoyed the gluttons out of ourselves.  Service was excellent and food was prepped amazingly well.  We partook of most of what every other reviewer has mentioned are the highlights- pork belly sliders, poutine, chicken liver toast, flat iron steak, pig ear, and my absolute dead on favorite, foie gras & biscuit with maple sausage gravy.  Certainly not a light meal, but absolute fantastic for a special occasion- or post marathon. As a side note, while I can continue to wax poetic about the food, I was less impressed with the desserts (tres leches and bacon crunch bar)- but I don't really think about going to a place like Animal for the dessert.  I'd be perfectly happy subbing in another plate of fois gras biscuits!

Oh Animal, how I wanted to love you but you hid the flavors of my favorite offal and then hid the flavors of new offal I wanted to try. The crispy pig's ear was great, but it just tasted like deep fried chorizo and lime.  This is a great flavor, but I wanted to taste pig ear because I never have before.  Now some of you reading this may say wait a minute, if you've never tasted it how do you know that's not what it tastes like?  Luckily my husband is a chef that has a bigger love of offal than me and make his own crispy pig's ear.  This was the first dish we had, so I said whatever you say dear and moved on to my favorite.....sweetbreads!!! *sigh* The sweetbreads tasted like whatever had been deep fried all day long in the fry oil.  I barely tasted the sweetbreads at all and had to search my palate for the light/rich flavor.  Bummer. Next we had the foie gras with maple sausage gravy & biscuit.  The gravy was freakin' awesome.  Heavy, delicious and pure South.  However, it completely over-powered the flavor of the foie gras.   I just don't get it.  Why, oh why would a restaurant that is supposed to pride itself on offal and bringing something new and exciting to LA hide the flavors it's trying to showcase?  Are they concerned that LA isn't really ready for these flavors?  I just don't understand and was bitterly disappointed, especially by the ridiculous bill.

This place would be my favorite restaurant if only I could afford it more often. For those who love meat (and all its varieties and preparations), Animal is the place to sate your appetite. The bone marrow with garlic toast is a must for those looking to try out a new dish, while the pulled pork sliders are tried, true and tasty. Animal is all about experimentation as the dishes are meant to be shared between two people. Bring a friend or partner, order some drinks and eat away at the most elegantly prepared animal parts you may ever eat. Make a reservation way ahead of time. Save up and order lots of food.

There are all types of food junkies out there.  Some love big portions.  Others love meaty dishes while few just care about cost.  I'm a man of both taste and variety.  Give me something that tastes absolutely delicious and try your best to make it unique.  Perfect those two qualities and you will forever have my respect.  Animal is such a unique conglomeration of these mantras and yea, sure, the portion's are small and the price of entry is high.  However, if you are a lover of a wonderful taste of food in all different ways, Animal is simply a must-see restaurant.   (Note: By the way, reserve!  It will make your life ten times easier.  Going early at 6pm, it took us nearly an hour to get in and the line seemed to only get steadily worse as the night wore on.) (Note 2: Take the address with you.  There aren't any signs for the restaurant.  And finally, they have valet parking but also, there is metered parking all over Fairfax and some of the adjacent streets that eventually, like around 8pm, become free!) The style of the restaurant is that their dishes are similar to tapas, small portions of some delicious food.  The quirk is that they will use all types of different flavors and meats (and different parts of the meat body that you may not be familiar with).  The dishes range from $3 to $28 when we were there although it looks like the menu is subject to change at will.  Ask your server for more information; they are more than happy to give you input into their menu items (or be brave and just try anything!) Here's a quick little look at what we had.   -Chicken Liver Toast: Simply a piece of toast with some chicken liver spread and some special onions on top. It was absolutely delicious and although the cheapest and smallest of the items we had, its a great way to start the meal.   -Marrow Bone: It will come out with two pieces of thick buttered bread along with the marrow bone that has been cut in half with some spices/herbs on top. You'll use a spoon to take some of the marrow bone out and spread it on the bread.  The taste was so poignant and herb-y with the bread nicely counterbalancing the taste.   -Crispy Pig's Head: This dish reminded me of a crab cake in look but the taste of a very salty and well-spiced chicken/pork.   -Veal Brain: Probably the boldest taste out of all the dishes we had.  Veal brain reminds me of a very thin layer of crispy chicken that immediately melts in your mouth.  Pair that with very strong flavors each time you bite it and its definitely a treat to behold.   -Pork Ribs: Finally, we had the pork ribs which for me, had a slightly less bolder (although still pretty strong) taste than the veal brain.  The meat was absolutely tender and came right off the bone with the prodding of a fork.  Take a bite of it and even before you bite into it, your mouth will feel the strong lemon/herb spices spreading into your throat.  Sure, the salad next to it wasn't as memorable but again, helped balance some of the crazy strong taste that came from the meat.   So as you can see, I really have very little complaints about the line-up we had ourselves and am eagerly anticipating the next time I could go again.  The simple decor and the lack of any signage may give off a vibe that this restaurant is too good to be true but again, if you love flavor, aren't afraid of small portions, and are an adventurer of food, look no further than Animal.

Christmas Eve at Animal.  Party of Five (One of whom is a Michael Bauer/Tony Bordain Wannabe) Food:   Pig ear - Intriguing but the lime and fried egg combination were not a match made in heaven Rabbit  - Delicious - solid hit Oxtail   -  Delicious - nonetheless a different cheese selection could have made it superlative Octopus - Delicious, however, slightly overcooked, chorizo slightly overpowering Tres leches - Good, the dulce de leche added a special touch Panna Cotta - Good, however, it needed a few more drops of the sweet balsamic reduction Service:   Hostesss -Warm and welcoming Staff  - Attentive Overall it was a pleasant fine dining experience.  I would definitely recommend Animal.  The Food Elitest (my son) recommends this place, as well.    Enjoy...

If you want some down to earth with a twist, then this the place to go...this has been my 3rd trip within 3 months...looks like the trend is going here every month. Ok...getting to the food... got to get the foie gras with maple gravy and biscuit...this will give you a heart attack...not because of it's content alone, but it's so worth it.  This is protein butter that just literally melts in your mouth with no hint that it taste like liver!  I can go for days with this but my doctor would probably not advise it.  It is so good. Chimichurri bone marrow with brioche toast...want more protein butter?  This is another excellent one...try it but beware of the excess sauce...it's a little overwhelming but you can move some aside. Octopus and chorizo....never thought it would go so well....so good...flavors are pronounced...what more can I say? There's more that I've tried but these would be my top three...so far....wanna be adventurous?  This is the closest to the perfect food destination....I just wish there were more food spots like this place...or maybe I haven't been looking hard enough...cheers animal!!!!  Expect me to be a regular!!!

I have only ever heard great things about Animal. It lived up to my every expectation and went beyond. Food: Pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg - Crisp pig ears with the perfect balance of sour and spice. Paired with the egg it was a brilliant and refreshing starter. Marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions - Not too much marrow flavor, but a spread of that on their toast was scrumptious nonetheless. Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - Didn't live up to everything I had heard about it. Tastes like a meat stew on top of fries, not that that's a bad thing. Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - Amazing dish with a great balance of sweet and savory. Barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw - Delicious delicious pork fat. Bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise - Lacking on the smokey bacon flavor one would expect. Definitely could pass on it next time. Service: Nothing to complain or rave about. Overall I really enjoyed Animal. It offers so many out of the norm dishes that not only intrigue but truly deliver. For the money I paid, it's definitely a great value and wonderful experience.

My boyfriend and I are both foodies so this was an excellent place to check out. The dishes are small so you can order a bunch of different things. Hamachi Tostada - this was a nice clean dish, the fish sauce makes the dish pop with flavor and the avocado works really well with the hamachi Chicken Liver Toast - this was pretty good, but would have been better if the toast was toastier, the caramelized onions on top were also a nice touch Bone Marrow - this was my least favorite dish of the night, but that probably has more to do with the fact that I haven't developed a taste for bone marrow just yet, to me it tastes like hot meat jello, but my boyfriend thought it was fantastic Rabbit Loin Spring Rolls - this was my first time eating rabbit and I can say I am now a believer that hippity hoppity animals need to be eaten! However, I could have done without the eggplant (but I just hate eggplant) BBQ Pork Belly Sliders - this is a must if you are coming here, they are absolutely delish, the dish comes with two but you really only need one since it is so rich and filling. I don't like eating chunks of pork fat but I made an exception for these since they were so tasty. Foie Gras Biscut with Maple Sausage Gravy - this is also a must, the foie was cooked perfectly and worked beautifully with the maple gravy, I just wish they used a biscuit that was not so flaky but maybe a bit more doughy. All in all this is a great date place, just make reservations well in advance or get there before they open so you can grab a seat at the bar (which serves the full menu). One of the charms of the restaurant is that you can't actually see where it is, since there are no signs.

I really enjoyed this place. I thought it was pretty badass as it's on Fairfax (in between Beverly and Melrose) where you wouldn't find a hip restaurant like this. Everything's great, but I strongly recommend the pork belly sandwiches! A little disappointing they don't have cocktails, because I think they'd do a great job creating unique ones.

Came here last thursday night with some friends, and I agree with everyone else. This place is GREAT! Not only is the concept unique for an American restaurant, the dishes we tried were all very delish! We ordered the following: -Lamb meatball (yum but a little mushy...does not have the texture of regular meatball, 4 stars) -Oxtail Poutine with fries (super yum, 5 stars) -Bone Marrow Sandwich (very good, different but tasty, 5 stars) -Pig Ear w/ Fried Egg (decent, but a little bit on the salty side, 3.5 stars. Chinese marinated pig ears taste better) -Porkbelly Sandwish/Slider (super yum. It's got a sweet taste to it after you bite into it. 5 stars!) -Rabbit legs (it was okay. Tasted like fried chicken. 3 stars) -Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar (dessert; super yummy!! best thing on the menu...5 stars!) This place gets super packed (even during the week) so don't forget to make a reservation first. Oh, and they only hold your res for 15 minutes, so try not to be late. I will definitely go back, but this time, I'll skip the rabbit legs and opt for the chorizo instead (heard it was good)

I have been to Animal twice now and both times have been awesome!  The first was for my husband's birthday and the second was for a business dinner with my work hubby.  Both the hubby and the colleague loved the place and I must admit I am a fan too.   First and foremost if you come to Animal, make a reservation and second, you should be a carnovore.   This isn't a veggie person's kind of place.   Like the server who helped us, I must recommend getting 2-3 appetizers and then sharing an entree (if you are a party of 2). They have the most amazing appetizer list that makes it's impossible to get just one thing. The appetizers that I have tried include: the pig ear with chili lime (good), the BBQ pork belly sandwiches (yummy!), fois gois on a biscuit with maple sausage gravy (oooh so amazing!). The entrees I have tried were: the veal (very good) and the balsalmic pork ribs (oh my goodness good!). The dessert I had both times: Joe's Donuts w/ cinnamon sugar and carmel (oh so scrumptious!). I wanted to try the bacon chocolate crunch bar but that was a little exotic for my hubby and my work hubby. I really like Animal's atmosphere. It could be both romantic and both hip and cool when dining for business.  Its not overly fancy but more hip to be cool.   Watch out when they turn those light down as the place becomes very cozy.  If you want to get your meat on and do it really well, then check out animal.

Amazingness on a plate (well, several plates).  I first have to note that halfway through dinner, Top Chef's Tom Colicchio walked in and sat at the bar with some friends.  If it's good enough for Chef Colicchio, I'm sold!  I was so star struck!  Now onto the food. Went with 2 friends, so we each picked a glass of wine, 3 apps and 2 entrees to share.  Each plate was solid freaking gold. Raw Amberjack - loved the combo of sweet citrus/fruits with the sashimi style fish.  It was definitely the lightest of all the dishes we ordered. Foie Gras - they had just changed the preparation of it THAT day, and it came highly recommended by our server.  Again, amazing.  Melt in your mouth goodness.  Combined with the fluffy pancakes and thick strips of bacon tucked away. Petite Basque and garlic bread - this was more of a confusing dish to us, but reminded me of a fancy garlic cheese bread.  I still wanted more. Quail Fry - think fried chicken, but more "gamier".  Absolutely LOVED the mashed potatoes, spinach and bacon that came with the dish.  The quail itself was "eh". Flat Iron Steak - SO SO good.  you have to eat meat at a place called Animal, and this hit the spot.  What was more amazing is that the corn and potatoes served with the steak were almost better than the steak.  In fact, in both the quail and steak dishes, the veggie sides were amaaaazing. We we too full for dessert (and a tad afraid to look at the bill after ordering all that sinfully goodness), so we walked to Canters for some cookies instead.  As we were leaving, the table next to us got the infamous bone-in rib eye...MUST try that next time.  It was gynormous!! I heart Animal, and so does my tummy.

Took my boyfriend here for his bday dinner Fri night and we both walked out of there on cloud nine... Every aspect of the experience proved why Animal is a standout. Every dish was decadent and just plain delicious. The melted petit basque came out sizzling chock-full of sliced chorizo, serving the perfect complement to the crunchy garlic crostini. I feel they course the apps there as our 2nd app, the pork ribs, come out just as we were finished our last dip into the petit basque. The ribs were just...WOW. We joked how you could have 2 orders of it as an entree and call it a day. Puts new meaning into 'fall-off-the-bone' goodness, and the taste was superb. Trust me, some of the best we've ever had. He, who usually is hesitant about any temperature of steak veering on rare trusted our server and went with "med rare" and although it came out much pinker than what I would deem med rare, ate every last bit of it. It was succulent, flavorful, and every part of the dish (cauliflower, brussel sprout, etc.) served as a great balance to the dish. I had the Veal Oscar w/ king crab, the Bearnaise made it very, very rich but I still savored it. Service was a bit brusque and no-nonsense, but that went w/ the vibe of the place. Our server was attentive without being overbearing, making sure we were tended to at all times without making it so obvious. Wines by the glass are a pricey but it's because they encourage buying by the bottle, which overall were all at a reasonable price range. Ask for a recommendation w/ your meal choices - our server selected one that was right on the money. Of course we couldn't leave without trying the bacon chocolate bar, which was so palatable (more so than I assumed it would be giving it's interesting twist,) that you could package it and sell it at any candy store. And the glass of Moscato was the perfect ending to a truly fulfilling meal. The menu changes regularly AND it's open until 2am? Go there. ASAP.

My wife and I have been dying to check out this restaurant for ages.  Finally we got a chance and took a few friends with us. Vibology: Restaurant has a seating capacity of 40.  Which is cool because I like the smaller joints.  But because of the acoustics, it sounds like the restaurant is twice the size.  The floors are concrete and the voices all bounce off it and into my ears.  Which isn't a problem for me, but there are a few friends of mine who have big issues with this.  I like loud bisro-y ambiences personally.  The people there all ranged from the hipstery set (the decemberist manager was there hanging), to the older foodie crowd.     Service: Our server was awesome, we gave a hefty 25% tip because of him.  The busboy seemed a little late on getting our little app plates, silver for dessert, etc. but its all good anyway. First courses:  Poutine, which was the gravy laden fries.  The gravy had bits of oxtail in it and for me that's what won me over.  Good lord.  The fries itself was okay but the oxtail gravy is the star of the show.  The Basque melted with slivers of chorizo on top of some crostini was very delicious.  The salad with beets and avocado with a lemony vinagrette was very fresh tasting and awesome.  My wife didn't like it too much b/c of the lemony-ness but I loved it.  We also got the pork belly with lentils and beans.  Porky deliciousness.  It was tender and the lentil and bean salad cut up the richness of the dish. Second Course:  We order the fried quail with grits.  AMAZING.  Who knew that bird was good KFC style?  The grits were the best I have EVER had, which made the wife jealous b/c she makes me grits for b'fast once in awhile (that is until she tasted it and agreed with me). Creamy and delish.  We also ordered the mexican shrimp it was served with some beans and olives, yummy.  The olives were the stars in my opinion.  Lastly we had the rabbit and kale ravioli in a truffled butter sauce. Simple. Light. Tasty. Truffflllllllllllllllleeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssss.. mmmmmm........ I wanted to rub that sauce all over.. So lush.. Third course:  Bacon Chocolate bar w/ creme anglaise.  Just for the novelty try it out.  Its good.  Like salty sweet? Go for it.  I personally liked the pot of chocolate pudding wayyyy better.  It was superb (frenchy accent please)!!!!   Washed it all down with some coffee.. Will I come back.  Absolutely, maybe to see what they change up and maybe to try the roasted leg of lamb for four (I saw one girl and one guy polish this sucker off and it smelled so darn good).  Who knows.  BTW they use local and fresh ingredients, everything looks really rustic and fresh.  Loved it.  Also they don't do substitutions ("politely declined" as noted on the menu), so finicky eaters back off!! Props to the chef who stands by their craft and creation. Till next time yelpies. Cheers.

Okay, I can say that this was probably one of the best meals I've had in Southern California and for those of you that know me, that's pretty high marks... for those of you that don't know me, take my word, that means something. So I went with 3 other friends and between the 4 of us, we did order probably close to half the menu.  I have to say that everything we had there was good so I'll only highlight the AMAZING items: 1)  fois gras with biscuit and maple gravy - yum yum yum... so rich. 2)  pork belly sliders - melt in your mouth good. 3)  headcheese - I know but don't let the fact that it's headcheese make you stop from ordering this, it was so good. 4)  pork ears - again, I know but it was good.  Warning, it's pretty spicy but oh so good. 5)  pork ribs - perfect... just enough fat and yeah, fall off the bone good. 6)  bacon chocolate crunch bar - this to me was my main course and my sole purpose for coming to this joint.  OMG OMG OMG Make reservations b/c we thought... 6PM on a Sunday, no problem right?  WRONG, we ended up eating at the bar which was just as good but if you want a table, make reservations. Their menu also changes so yeah, I'm coming back often... and it wasn't even that bad.  Came out to about $60/person and trust me, I've spent more for bad food before so this was nothing.  Totally worth it and much more.

This was the dining highlight of our week long visit to California!  I am still thinking of the meal...it was just that GOOD!  We were at a Craig Ferguson show prior & I thought we would have oodles of time to kill after so made the reservation for 6pm.  We didn't get there til 6:30.  The lovely hostess still managed to seat us but did tell us we would have to leave by 8 but if we thought we wanted to stay & dilly dally we could sit at the bar.  Very nice and I was happy to even still get in!  We chose a table. We ordered 2 appys, 2 mains, 1 dessert, a 2 & 1/2 glass carafe of wine & a rootbeer.  For $106 total before tip, I was truly happy & amazed!  The one thing I have to say about the food was it was totally PERFECTLY SEASONED!  Everything just tasted delicious...I was so impressed! My fave was the pork belly/slaw buns, but the quail fry was equally as good!  The best fried bird I have EVER tasted!  The service was amazing too, nothing missed at all - everyone working there stopped by at one point or another to chat and see if everything was good.   My son finished with the tres leches dessert recommended to him by our waitress.  It was sensational!  I had a bite and it was so rich and creamy and milky.  He said it's one of the best desserts he's ever had, and he's had a lot desserts!   Very impressive.  We finished right at 8pm. I am so proud of myself for the choice I made when doing my research on where to dine, and jealous of the locals who can go back any time they want!!  So lucky they are!  Next time I'm back in L.A., this place is #1 on my "to-do" list!

If you haven't eaten at ANIMAL you are missing out! Amazing food :) Hamachi Tostada hands down the best thing I've eaten in a long time. It revitalized my taste buds to want to explore new flavors and combinations that our lovely Earth has provided for us all along. Revamping a simple Mexican dish with an Eastern mix was GENIUS! P.s. they have Mexican Coke!!! wow.

Tapas style dishes makes it fun to eat as a couple, not sure for larger groups though. Veal Brain- Mushy texture.  I guess thats how brains on a veal tastes    like.  Maybe Im used to adult brains on a taco.  Pretty good though. Foie Gras Moco Loco - very good.  The star on the menu if you ask me. Balsamic Vinegar BBQ Ribs-  BV was overpowering and too salty.  It tasted better as a leftover the next day. The least favorite dish of the night. Bone Marrow- Salty. Slimy and greasy.  Had it one other time at Craft Steak.  Remembered it tasting different. Grilled Quail Legs- Tasty, sauce was good too.  Should of ordered two of those. Pig Ear- salty but flavorful The service was outstanding.

Ah yes, too cool for a name I see... hey, I'm all for being hip and stealth, but Animal's failure to procure clear signage for the exterior of their restaurant is mildly annoying and presumptuous. Other than that, there's little to complain about. Besides, the name itself is misleading - I walked into Animal expecting I'd have to tackle a full menu of meatiness (I tend to not eat much meat in general), but I left realizing that even a veggie could eat here and be fairly satisfied. All the dishes we ordered were great - creative, perfectly cooked, and delicious. I would order any of these again: * baby kale, pecorino, lemon chili vinaigrette - The dressing has a bite strong enough to make you forget that you're eating what can sometimes feel/taste like a bush or brush on the side of the road (I love kale!). * radicchio, persimmon, escarole, pomegranate, pear - perfectly fresh and of course yummy seasonal combo. * hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut - my personal fave of the night. Great flavors, spicy  because of the peppers, but also crunchy because of the peanuts. yum! * grilled octopus, chorizo, chowchow * balsamic pork ribs, delicata squash, arugula, pecan - I just tasted this, but the meat was perfectly cooked, falling off the bones delicately.  Delicious balsamic BBQ sauce.

Hmm. Had a hard time deciding between the 3 and 4 stars. I would give it 4 if I truely were a fan, and by fan I would consider that wanting to come here more than twice a year. The food here is VERY rich, as in butter, oil, meat, more oil. Not something I'm used to on a daily basis but this is definitely a good place to try if you're looking for something beyond ordinary American cuisine. Ox tail, pig ear, quail, octopus, pork ribs, bone marrow are eye catchers on the menu. Although I've had a majority of the above, all of these are prepared in ways that I've never experienced or heard of. Two of my friends and I ordered 5 dishes and 3 glasses of wine. They accidentally brought us 6 dishes instead. :) Our dishes came in the following order: Chicken liver toast (2) - If you've had Vietnamese sandwiches, this kind of taste like the slightly spoiled meat in the combo sandwiches, but even more pungent. I think it was topped with caramelized onions which paired very well. Thumbs up to try although one piece of toast and spread was a bit pricey. Bbq pork belly sandwiches + slaw - You'd think the pork belly had enough grease in the middle, they had serve the animal between a croissant like bread! Asides the instant heart attack, each bite melts in your mouth, no really it does. Another dish I'd recommend to try although I'm sure other restaurants make something similar. Marrow bone chimichurri and carm onions - This was my least favorite dish. The presentation was enjoyable, kind of reminded me of my dog's half eaten bone sliced in half horizontally and filled with what taste like Italian pesto and onions. H'orderves style dish, I'd skip this and try something else. Balsamic pork ribs, tomatoes + panzanella -  I was most excited for this and the last plate. Probably my favorite selection of the night. The meat slides pretty cleanly off the bone and is blackened to perfection on the outside. Paired well with greens (finally! some fiber!), heirloom tomatoes and well seasoned croutons. I'd come back for this again. Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - Glorified cheese fries to the max! I've had oxtail as a light soup with veggies, but wow, this is like cheese french fry heaven. By the time this came to us, we were so full and didn't eat 70% of it. I ended up taking this home. I reheated this in a skillet the next day and wasn't surprised by the amount of oil that melted out of the "food". haha Nevertheless I ate all of it and it was still quite delicious. :P Luckily I read other yelp reviews and decided to go on an empty stomach. The 3 of us left full, $36 poorer and very satisfied. Not bad for 5 dishes to share and 1.5 glasses of the house red wine. Great service and definitely a place to take an out-of-towner or explorative eater, oh and do make reservations!

It's hard to have a light (what ever your diet-- low cal, low carb, low fat, high protein), when you cannot make changes or substitutions-- they are kindly declined, as noted on the menu. There were 3 non-animal options. They were out of halibut (okay, this is semi-animal) The other option was a coconut bread-- which I noticed after I ordered, but was probably not the "low cal" option. The third option was a yellow tail hamachi. It is listed on their sample online menu as follows: hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut. It includes avocado. and peanuts. Not low cal. But I'm still hungry. For the record, the Hibachi was in fact tasty. Four hours later, I still feel like I swallowed a clove of garlic. It's a tapas bar-- expect to share, and expect small portions. A few people in our party had the disappearing portion of halibut, which was probably about an ounce of fish in a small puddle of some type of garnish, or stew. I also tried the dolce desert. It was tasty-- not too sweet, creamy, fresh. Just perfect. If you're an herbi going with a bunch of meat eaters, you may get stuck with a pretty high bill once you split the tab ($15 hamachi cost me $50 by the end of the night, and I had no alcohol). The vibe is intended to be a bit dry, and monotone. I guess it creates a nice canvas for the "animal" food. Kind of slaughterhouse-ish with wood tables, but it's nice, and the tables are shiney. Had an eerie feel to it. Not warm-- spaced out and kind of modern. Hostess table is so close to door you may run into it walking in. Not recommended for a first date, since it's not a cheerful place. Probably better for a 4th date, when neither of you are paying attention to one another anyway. All in all, I'm sure it fulfills its purpose and I'm probably not giving it the best review because I don't eat half of the menu.

My friends and I did a day trip exploring the Best Thing I Ever Ate from Food Network. We ordered a Chocolate Covered Bacon Crunch Bar which came with s&p ice cream. At first I was like s&p? They can't possible mean salt and pepper...but what else could it be? While waiting on our dessert, I was browsing through the menu and (oh man!) it sounds so interesting!!! One of the things that caught my eyes was the Bone Marrow. It didn't help when the waiter brought Bone Marrow to the table next to us. I just watched them devour the Bone Marrow and they made sure to scrape all the good stuff on that plate. Hmmm...made me really want to try the other stuff on the menu. Woohoo! Our dessert arrived and it had such an interesting taste. I'm not really sure about the taste of each item by itself, but it really worked as a whole! I liked the crunch from the bar, the bitter taste from the dark chocolate, and the salt  and pepper ice cream! Ahhh...it's just hard to describe so you gotta go try it out yourself. =P After cleaning our plate, I convinced my friends to try the Bone Marrow, so we placed an order...yay! Once again...the Bone Marrow was interesting. Bone Marrow was really rich in its flavor and the added chimmchurro on top was excellent! I really, REALLY, really want to come back to this place. Their menu changes daily/weekly and their menu is different from the norm (which I love!).

The menu here changes all the time. I was sad to see that lots of the things that looked tasty in the reviews weren't being served that night. Here are some of the things we tried. Poutine: OK. I mean, it has french fries. It is pretty darn hard to screw up french fries. The meat in it was good. Gravy was ok. Melted Petit Basque with Chorizo: Tasted like pepperoni pizza. Not a fan. Fluke: This appetizer was tiny. Otherwise I enjoyed the mix of flavors. But seriously tiny. Pork chop: Tasty, well prepared. Pork belly with kimchi: The pork belly part was very delicious. The kimchi tasted more like vinegar vegetable salad. Very vinegary. Too bad. Overall I wish the menu had more meat options. It was very pork and beef heavy when we went.

My new local neighborhood weekend dinner spot! We had the oxtail-aged cheddar fries(OMG so surprisingly delicious), the pork belly with kimchi slaw and the pork belly sandwiches(though they are famed for the pork belly with kimchi slaw, I loved the pb sandwiches better) and the foie gras on top of a biscut with maple syrup sausage gravy(honestly, when I put it in my mouth time felt like time stood still for a moment, I was in heaven). We also had the house cabernet which was very nice actually. I didn't have room for dessert but we are definetely planning to go back! Our waiter was amazing, he does or used to work at O Mozza, I like my servers to have a sophisticated palate, he definetely did! The atmosphere/ambience is minimal and modern(I wish they would dim the lights a bit more)

BBQ pork belly sandwiches are delicious. I will definitely come back to have some more of these. Tried several other things including the infamous bacon chocolate bar (meh) and the foie gras + biscuit in maple sausage (good but pricey) but nothing beats the BBQ pork belly sandwiches for me. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly also, so go ahead and ask them a question about anything (we asked what do people feed ducks to get their liver all fatty).

It is so hard to choose from this menu because most everything sounds great.  I came here with a group of 4, and we shared the squash blossoms, the bbq pork belly, the oxtail poutine, the king crab, the melted petit basque, the foie gras spam, and the bacon chocolate bar.  We also had prosecco all around.  (The bill came out to $50 per person.  Everyone else wasn't too hungry though, so it'd probably be more on average.)  Everything was tasty, but my least favorite were probably the poutine and the chocolate bar.  The poutine was just way too rich.  I'm sensitive to saltiness and the poutine was rich in that way if that makes any sense. It didn't help that I ate most of it.  (The portion for this dish was huge.)  The chocolate bar was just so-so.  Not anything I'd want to try again.  The bacon was interesting, but not what you would call delicious.   This is definitely a place you can come back to again and again with the extensive changing menu.  Too bad I was only visiting!

My girlfriend took me here for my birthday.  It was a fantastic evening with great food, and friendly service.  The shining star of our meal was the foie gras, biscuit, with maple sausage gravy.  Yes, I know foie gras is controversial and cruel.  But this dish was so sinfully delicious.  Fatty, flavorful, sweet.  Good thing it comes in a small serving. Ya'll need to try it.  Going to hell has never been this delicious.

If I can have a complete set of meal before I die, Animal will be the last meal for me. Not only Animal gives me a solid best of culinary experience, I wouldn't be surprised if Animal will boost my cholesterol level instantly - but I'll enjoy it with no regrets. Living up to its name, Animal is dedicated to all of you carnivore who has the ultimate urge towards meat and other animal parts. Pig ear? Duck liver? Three layer of pork fat? Relax... although the menu might give you a sensory overload, just set your fear aside 'coz Animal will magically turn all of your disgust and leaving you with foodgasm of wanting for more and more.. Enough said, let's get down to business... Oxtail-drenched Poutine - gourmet cheese melted fries with oxtail braised on top. We were swimming in the richness of oxtail gravy... Foie Gras on top of biscuit in maple gravy tub - controversially scrumptious and decadent. The only downside about this is $22 for such a small portion. We were fighting over this like true animals... Sunny side up egg on top of thinly sliced pig ear covered in scallions and slightly spicy lime-chili - crispy and overly salty - interestingly good but we're not rushing back for this. Pork belly topped with kimchi, scallions, peanuts and chili-soy - the moist and cruchy pork belly was vitalized by the sweet sour contrast of the Korean kimchi - one of the best picks of the night! Quail fry with grits, chard, slab bacon, maple jus - full of moist and juice for such tiny birds but wasn't too memorable for me. Bacon Chocolate Truffle Bar - loving the filling taste and texture of the dark chocolate - not too sweet and the bacon bits adds salty finish. Bacon and Chocolate? Everything tastes better with bacon! My new food quest: to try every single dish Animal has to offer. Now you know where I can be found for dinners. pics - http://www.yummycrave.co…

Ambiance:  Simple settings with a low lighting and lounge-y feel.  Has a cool vibe. Service:  Our waiter was genuine and knowledgeable about the food.  He recommended that we order a lot of plates and just share everything - we happily complied.  Our waiter also reviewed our order to make sure that we were ordering enough but not too much.  Water glasses were filled and plates were taken away very promptly and unobtrusively. Food:  Delicious!  Honestly it felt like each plate that arrived exceeded the last (which was amazing considering how tasty each one was).  We tried tons of things but I would have to say that the best of the best were - the ricotta gnocchi (oh my god it was my favorite thing ever - little fluffy pillows of heaven); the poutine (oxtail, gravy, fries and cheese - it is not as low brow as it sounds - it honestly is rich savory and complex).  We were too full for dessert, but I'm sure it would be delicious (except that i heard the chocolate covered bacon is overrated).  Really though, I am pretty sure that you could order anything off the menu and be incredibly happy with it!  I would go there again and definitely order as much as possible. Overall:  Go to this place asap!  Getting reservations ahead of time is a good idea because waiting for a table might be inconvenient (not a fun block to wait around on).  Delicious food and quality service.  Nom nom nom!

Best restuarant in Los Angeles. Nothing here is bad. Great service. If you are hesitant to try it because you think it may be too heavy or a carnivore's cave, don't be. Every dish is very balanced and may not be what you think it tastes like. A heavy sounding dish like chorizo and cheese may sound heavy but tastes very light and refreshing. Strawberry and pound cake with cream for dessert may be the best dessert I have ever had. Seriously a must try.

It's no wonder it's so hard to get a reservation here. I had a foie gras loco moco (an open face burger with a quail egg on top). It was AMAZING. I don't normally eat sweetbreads or pig ear but both dishes were good as well. Each dish had its own unique taste and flavor. Sorry I'm not a fan of the bacon chocolate crunch bar. I know most dishes usually taste better with bacon but maybe not dessert. I am definitely going back!

i love this place.  Good food, great service, nice ambiance.  All you need is good company and a reservation :D   I've been to this restaurant twice now, and both experiences were great.  The first time I went, I had a reservation and was able to sit at the table.  The second time around, my girlfriend and went last minute, and sat at the bar.  No fear though!  The bar serves a full menu on top of the drinks, so all is good with the world. :)  If you want to be guaranteed a table, i recommend making reservations the day before or a little earlier in the day.   4 stars because of the aforementioned compliments.   Now straight into the food! Chicken Liver Toast i love this dish, but it is quite the heavy one.  Also, you must have a liking for liver or pâté.. they put a pretty hefty serving of the liver on there and the taste is strong. BBQ Pork Belly Sliders w/ Slaw i LOVE, one of my favorites. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm all about grease and fattiness when it comes to pork belly dishes, it's what makes them so great!  These sliders are awesome.  I don't know if i can stomach more than 2 of them though if i want to eat more than just the sliders, because they are pretty fatty (but wonderful!).  The claw cuts the fattiness of the pork though, and complements the taste very very well. Sweet, tart, slightly smokey, juicy, flavorful, DELISH.   Balsamic Pork Ribs These ribs are awesomeee.  Another one of my faves.  Super tender and juicy, no problems just forking it off and eating the meat.  They hold in the flavors of the balsamic so well, and have this tangy kick while offering the comfort that traditional pork ribs do (and should :D ).  Bellissimo! Marrow Bone, Chimichurri,  Caramelized Onions This concoction of deliciousness is served with the perfect toast.  Top the toast off with a little marrow, some chimichurri, and some onions, and it will send you straight to heaven.  This is definitely not a dish for everyone, especially those who don't do the whole marrow/cartilage/blood thing.  but it's definitely a great dish and worth a try.  The chimichurri is excellent!  A great combo of flavors: the flavorful and strong kick of the chimichurri and the onions, to complement the subtle flavors of the marrow.  DELISH! Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar, s&p Anglaise Honestly, not a big fan.  I know they're well known for this, but I really didn't find it amazing or anything.  It's different, definitely interesting, but not "OMG this is SO GOOD" worthy.   Can't wait to return and try more! :)

The pig ear tasted like cardboard.  The egg on top of the pig ears tasted like cardboard. The waitress brought me the wrong dish- and then argued with me about whether or not I ordered it- "see that's what i wrote down.  that's what i heard"- multiple times.  and my response was- you can keep saying that- but the fact of the matter is there is no way I would order hamachi when I wanted foie gras.  and if I wanted hamachi- I'd go to a japanese spot. needless to say- after about 5 minutes of this- it took two other people at my table to reiterate to the waitress that she got it wrong.  i think by the time the dishes i ordered came out- my buddies were done w/ theirs.  It is loud in here.  You will have to strain your ears to hear the person next to you & you will feel like you are damn near yelling to have a convo.  However, I'm still wanting to come back and try some of the other dishes.

Not that another review lauding the accomplishments of this restaurant is needed, but my meal last night was so fantastic that I simply could not resist. My dinner was the ill fated result of betting my hopes that United could beat Barca, and although my bitter disappointment will last until European Glory returns to Manchester, this meal went a long way to easing my pain. My friend and I ordered the Pork Belly sliders, Veal Brains, Bone Marrow, Foie Gras, and the Oxtail Poutine. The dishes came out, one by one, in this order, and by the end I was dizzy from taste overload. I would recommend any of these dishes, as they were all simply delicious. On a side note, you may feel somewhat out of place without your flannel shirt, but rest assured there is no irony served with any dish.

My roommate kept raving about how amazing this place was so when we finally made plans to go I was very excited (and barely ate anything all day in order to have room for Animal). BIG MISTAKE! The experience was off to a bad start because this place is super hard to find. It's nestled in between run-down businesses and has no clear sign that it's there. Frankly, I feel it's a little bit like a slap in the face to the other businesses that this chic modern-looking restaurant decided to plop itself there. Once we were inside...this is the part I liked...the cool, intimate vibe of the place became apparent. It is very small and a reservation is definitely needed especially on busy nights. The wooden tables and chairs also added to the atmosphere. And the waiter was very attentive. But this is where my liking of Animal stops. My party was made up of 4 very hungry people. Our waiter said everything is 'family style' and that we should order different dishes to be able to share and experience more. We all agreed on that since we were eager to try the rabbit and poutine. So we ordered the bacon-wrapped rabbit, sweetbreads, oxtail poutine and pork belly sandwiches. After waiting for about 30 minutes (even though we were promised the food would arrive fast), we got our rabbit. It was delicious BUT 3 tiny pieces barely put the taste in our mouths (and the sauce was way too vinegary). The sweetbreads were the same...tiny pieces that were finished in one bite. The poutine was a little more filling but who wants to get french fried at a high-end restaurant? The oxtail gravy though was to die for. Lastly, the pork belly sandwiches were sub-par. There was way too much bbq sauce, they were way too fatty and of course way too small. In the end, each of us walked away $30 poorer and 3/4 walked away hungry. It was not worth the price and frankly its "gourmet" food WAS good but I can find better for cheaper somewhere else.

This restaurant is the reason I even started a Yelp account.  In fact it is also because of the experience at Animal that I finally understood why this website is called "Yelp".  I literally wanted to tell EVERYBODY about my dinner last night as quickly and as loudly as I could.  The concept of this restaurant is pretty simple.  If you like food, you will like this restaurant.   What I devoured (between 2 people): - foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions - poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar - barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw They were all winners, and so are you if you decide to eat at this fine establishment.

I was iffy about coming to this place with my friend because she had told me that this is one of those good-food-but-in-small-portions-for-an-expensive-?price places. But she kept raving about those pork belly sandwiches so I gave in and we paid Animal a visit last Saturday. We called ahead to place a reservation and the lady told us that she could either put us down for 6:15, 6:45 or after 10pm. So call in; don't just show up and expect to get seated! The place is quite small, with no signage and very clean/minimalistic interior design, not what you'd expect for such an expensive restaurant. I quite liked that though, because it didn't seem like they were trying so hard to advertise themselves and it made me feel like I was "in the know" hehe. The customer service is good. I liked that our waiter actually knelt down next to the table to talk to us at eye-level rather than towering above us. It's the small details that makes the difference between decent and great customer service. My friend and I ordered: 1. squash blossom [salad], pickled wax beans, parmesan: the salad is really light, and the blossoms add an interesting touch. I liked how the pickled wax beans adds a slightly more flavorful twist, but it's not so strong that it overpowers the salad. 2. balsamic pork ribs, baby heirloom tomato panzanella: one of my favorites out of the dishes we ordered that night! I loved the way the balsamic enhanced the flavor of the BBQed pork ribs, and the meat was cooked so nicely - soo soft and juicy. The meat just fell off the bone when I was cutting with the knife. 3. melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread: hahah my friend and I didn't really know how to eat this dish so we just cut up the basque (which is kind of like baked cheese with chorizo inside) and put it on the bread. It was pretty good, but I don't think it was one that special compared to the other dishes. 4. pork belly sandwiches, slaw: another favorite dish of the night! the pork belly portion was so generous and the meat so soft and juicy. It wasn't all fatty/oily either; I'd say it's more meat than fat. The bread is so soft and one bite in, I was in love. My friend keeps raving about it to this day (we went to Animal 3 days ago...) 5. poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar: who would've thought something as simple as fries and gravy would taste so good? And the oxtail was a good addition that didn't distract from the crunchiness of the fires or the flavor of the gravy. 6. bacon chocolate crunch bar: the bar is in three parts. the upper and lower parts have a sort of chocolate mousse-like texture, with bacon bits on the top part, while the middle is this thicker, oh so rich chocolate. SO RICH. I think it was a little too rich for me, but the bacon bits added a nice salty touch. In summary, I am coming back here again before the end of the month and getting the balsamic pork ribs, the pork belly sandwiches, the poutine, and trying the foie gras loco moco!

another place in LA that is wayyyyy overrated. everything was just okay, nothing really stood out. wine selection was poor as well. in my opinion it's overpriced hyped up food that doesn't really deliver in taste.

We needed to find a place that could take a same-day reservation for 12 and miraculously,  Animal had availability. They'd only been open for a couple of weeks, but the staff handled themselves like pros. I've been to a lot of new restaurants lately and I was impressed. The food was terrific: creative, thoughtful and showed the chefs' personality -  aka their fondness for pork. I share their porcine affection and was therefore charmed by their inclination to slip pork products into nearly  every dish, including the dessert. More on that later. We had a large party and tried a lot of stuff. Highlights included the ridiculously tender and tasty ribs appetizer, the melty Petit Basque and chorizo app, fresh and pork-free whole branzino and the hangar steak with sweetbreads. I found the amberjack poke to be just ok - perhaps it needed some pancetta to brighten it up. The only area where the restaurant showed its youth was in the wine department. They had some interesting selections, but only had two bottles of our favorite Spanish red and then were out of our second and third choices. Nonetheless, they had some interesting stuff and it was reasonably priced. They serve their reds chilled which I have mixed feelings about - it was refreshing on a hot day, but the depth of the wine was stunted and not as complementary to the meat dishes as I would have hoped. FYI corkage is a reasonable $20. Desserts included the delicious and too-rich chocolate/bacon bar and a delicious berry/nectarine crisp. Other people have mentioned that the space is incredibly loud and they are not exaggerating. Animal could use a sound-dampening strategy and it would be nearly perfect. I'm in.

Stopped here randomly looking for a good new place to eat at and was pleasantly surprised. The menu changes everyday and you'll see things on it that will astound you in the most awesome of ways! (for example: a Burger (perfectly cooked) with foie gras and quails egg on top, surrounded by an amazing sauce with rice!!!) If they have the oxtail french-fry dish please order it right now!!!

The food was top notch and service was great.  Pork belly sliders and chicken liver were very rich, but the grilled branzino provided a good balance.   Main flaw was the drink menu: the "house cabernet" for $7 was two buck chuck, and the beer list was so so.

This is not an angry or vengeful review, the restaurant just wasn't that good. Apparently they are VERY strict on arriving no later than 15 minutes after your reservation (per their website), but with a phone call I was able to push back our reservations.  Had difficulty finding the place as it didn't have any name or marquee outside (HINT: make sure you write down the address # before you leave, if we didn't have it I don't know how we would have found it otherwise) When my boyfriend and I arrived, we were disappointed with their decor (or lack thereof).  White walls with white canvases towards the ceiling, lightbulbs sticking out.  Lame!  If their food was better, I would have been more forgiving.  Our waiter was very pleasant (and Scottish!  Accent!  Swoon!)  I ordered balsamic pork ribs and my boyfriend ordered the fried quail, with the pork sliders for an appetizer. The sliders were delicious (and the only reason I give this place 2 stars, that and the good service), juicy and tasty.  Ribs were slathered in sauce, which was overbearing (also note that this is a FULL rack of ribs, big enough for 3 people, they didn't even fit on the plate).  Needless to say I have leftovers.  The fried quail reminded my boyfriend of KFC, which is not a good thing.  It was flavorful, but nothing truly unique or amazing. All in all, Animal was nothing memorable.  Save your money and go somewhere else.

I just came back from a birthday dinner here and it was outrageously great.  We had five people in the party and everyone enjoyed it.  Our server was very knowledgeable on the menu and threw in a few jokes during the meal. Chicken liver toast-pretty simple, but had a great smooth texture on a nice soft bread.  The balsamic glaze on top put it over the top though. Baby broccoli, pancetta, parmesan, soft egg, bread crumbs-I'm not a huge fan of broccoli but with all the other things mixed in it was alright, not my favorite dish of the night though. Ricotta & goat cheese gnocchi w/ bolognese-I was really looking forward to this one and it did not disappoint.  Tender gnocchi and a nicely flavored bolognese in the middle. Melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread-This was another I was excited about.  The chorizo and cheese mixture was nice, but I wish the bread had been the same they used on the chicken liver toast as this one was a bit harder than I would have liked. Hamachi, torn herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, crispy shallot-The hamachi was basically sashimi (about 3-4 pieces), which I have no problems with.  Had a nice bit of spicy with the jalapeno slivers and an overall nice light taste. Sweetbreads, creamed spinach, capers, hen of the woods-This was a surprise for me as I haven't really experienced sweetbreads that much.  The waiter said it was the best sweetbreads he had ever had and it lived up to that.  The mushroom and spinach were a great compliment to the dish. Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar-I was a little hesitant with this one since I've always been a little scared of the mere thought of poutine.  Wicked good though, and the oxtail was very tender.  So glad this came out after everything else though as it was pretty heavy. Flat iron, artichoke hash, truffle parmesan fondue-This was absolutely delicious.  The fondue on top left a nice flavor and the artichokes on the bottom completed it so well. Bacon chocolate crunch bar-A little disappointing as this was what made us want to go to Animal in the first place.  Not saying it was bad, just was a little much. Pound cake, macerated strawberries, cream-For sure the better of the two desserts.  Great pound cake and real nice strawberries. The wine and beer menu also was nicely arranged.  I was pleasantly surprised the Downtown Brown being there. I also couldn't pass up going to Canters for the bakery counter after, but thats another review.

So, I'm in love. I have never had a 100% success rate with small plates. I love maybe one of them, like a few others, bored by another. Animal changed that. My girl friend and I ordered the hamachi, foie gras biscuit, sweetbreads and poutine; all completely excellent. Hand to god, not one complaint here. If I had to pick an absolute favorite.. well, I really couldn't. Sorry! Great service and fantastically reasonable. Probably not the best place to go for a date, as it's REALLY loud inside. My friend and I left still yelling at each other. Also, a bottle of their 'Animal House' cab is $20. Oh lord. And it's pretty damn good, too. I already have plans to return.

This place lives up to the hype.   We did the counter seating and ordered some of the recommended dishes.  There are many more that we still need to try (including the loco moco, pig ear, etc) but will have to leave that for the next visit!   -Pork Bell Sliders:  Delicious.  The slaw was a bit overpowering initially but all in all this is a must try dish.  The bread used for this dish is also fantastic. -Shaved Carrot Salad:  light and refreshing with a nice amount of acid to cut the more fatty flavors of the other dishes.  Green Goddess Dressing is used in this dish but we still have not been able to replicate the same flavor at home. -Skirt Steak with Truffle and Parmesan Fondue, Asparagus Hash, et al:  This was the favorite dish of the night.  Strong truffle flavors that come from cooking the actual truffles down instead of simply using truffle oil like so many other restaurants.  Meat was tender and flavorful and the asparagus hash was the perfect side item. -Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar:  A very good representative of the bacon/chocolate/salty/sweet combination dessert that is common these days. Service was attentive and knowledgeable.  We can't wait to return!

Dear Animal, What does it take to get a decent seat in the house? I have visited on two occasions, both with reservations, and both times my party was seated right near the door. I acknowledge that I am there for the food, but at least once I would like to enjoy your food without the receptionist/seater's butt three feet from my face. This past Saturday when I visited I had a 7pm reservation. I was elated when I entered because I saw a table near the back of the restaurant away from the front door. Then, the seater put us right at the front of the restaurant. Why??? 10 minutes later, the 6:45 party arrived for their reservation and was seated at the back table. What gives??? I guess I should just arrive 25 minutes late for my reservation next time and I'll get the better seating. Sincerely, An Irritated Guest

I have to say that this restaurant is no where near what it could/should be. I'm not sure if LA is new to the "New American" fare but if this is the best they've got, that's trouble for sure. The dishes are all very salty. That's the first thing I noticed. I had four dishes. I know the menu changes a lot so they are probably switching all the time which might be their downfall. They don't perfect anything. Everything is very thrown together and salted. I had baby kale, pecorino, lemon chili vinaigrette, breadcrumbs. I should've comprehended what I was ordering before I ordered it but lemon chili vinaigrette on kale.. not working. It's so bitter and sour that it burned my mouth up with acid. Oh and it's... salty. Then I had the melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread. Melted cheese over chorizo, with salt. Greasy and thrown together and sent out. Not a very good mixture of flavors. Nothing really extraordinary. Just greasy and salty. Then the hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut? Another strike out. The fish alone was a delicious cut but I'm not sure how it all meshed together. All the ingredients sort of stood out by themselves. No meshing. A few peanuts, the herbs where apart and not mixed in well... and the tostada? Please. Not good. And the barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw ... salty. Dry. Ick. Sorry Animal, I really wanted to like you.

I can't quite give Animal five stars because some of their dishes were just way too ridiculous for me. The ones I DID enjoy, however, blew my mind. But then again, considering the amount that you'll pay, anything less than awesome is a disappointment. Six of us came here for a 10:15 reservation. Their kitchen closes at 10:45 so we were pretty rushed in getting our order in, which was a little annoying. Let's go down the list. Pork belly sliders - THE WINNER OF THE NIGHT. From the buttered bun, to the delicious slaw in zesty dressing, to the juicy pork belly, to the ridiculous bbq sauce, these sliders were out of bounds, man. Out of bounds. 5.5 stars. Braised pork ribs - served with a side (more like 1/4 side) of arugula, squash, and walnuts, which was decent. But the RIBS. I was so excited when the ribs arrived that I put one end entirely into my mouth, hoping to slide the meat off the bone with my teeth. BUT IT WASN'T BONE, IT WAS CARTILAGE. I chewed up the meat and cartilage altogether in one fabulous explosion of flavor and texture. 5 stars. Flat iron steak - cooked with potatoes and gravy, smothered in PARMESAN TRUFFLE SAUCE. We only ordered one of these to share, so the six of us only had about one big bite each. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE. 5 stars. Foie gras biscuits and gravy - foie gras is duck liver, served over a moist biscuit with luscious gravy. If you order this, be prepared to blurt out an involuntariy "OMFG." 5 stars. Chicken liver toast - a small strip of buttered toast covered in chicken liver pate and an onion marmalade. 4 stars. Sweetbreads - these were very good. They weren't OUT OF BOUNDS, but they were good. I didn't learn until 24 hours later what sweetbreads actually are. The sweetbreads at Animal are veal thymus glands. Lightly breaded. 4 stars. Foie gras terrine (pate) - served as a huge block of pate and a bunch of buttered toast. The toast was so soft that it was hard to spread the pate. But still, yums. 4 stars. Bone marrow - I'm new to eating bone marrow, so it's still not quite my thing. I didn't realize that you were supposed to spread the marrow on their buttered toast, so I just scooped it straight into my mouth. Probably shouldn't have done that. 3 stars. Veal brain - the first two bites I took were actually really good. The brain has almost no consistency, it was just salty, well-seasoned mush. When I looked across the table at my friend Dainy L, her reaction was not nearly as pleasant. I laughed to myself and thought, "What a newb. I wonder why she doesn't like it. Hm, maybe because it's...brain..." Suddenly my mind starting swirling around this one word - brain. Each bite after that became significantly less delicious. Damn you Dainy L. 2.5 stars. Poutine - pulled oxtail, melted cheese, gravy, all over french fries, THE ONE DISH WE ALL WANTED TO TRY, SOLD OUT. You know what, I can't in my right mind give Animal four stars when they ran out of the thing we were all looking forward to most. Sorry Animal, you've got some legit five star dishes, but no poutine, $45/person, so three stars.

If you really enjoy food, then you really need to check out Animal asap. Everything we ordered was A-MA-ZING, especially the pork belly sliders. Food is 5 stars, but I gave it 4 stars overall because the interior is too minimalist/simple for me (personal preference, that's all).

First - my grumbles. 1) I made a reservation for a special occasion a month in advance so that everything would go perfectly. Upon arrival (right on time) we were told that we would have to wait to be seated even though there were three tables open. They were trying to arrange a few tables together for a larger group, understandable. But the other table they said they were holding for someone that had reservations 30 minutes earlier who still hadn't shown up. What?? If we are here now and they are not, we should be seated. I don't care whose reservation came first. We were told we could wait at the bar, where there was not a single seat open. So we stood at the bar until a table was "ready". 20 minutes after we were finally seated, Elijah Wood showed up with 2 companions. I'm a big fan Frodo, but I swear to the One Ring, if they refused to seat us because they were waiting for you to show up...I will not send you a birthday card next year. 2) We ended up being seated next to a table of 5 with three women on one side who had lined up all their purses on the bench next to them, bleeding halfway into our bench seat. Not coming up to the edge of our table but literally - into our seat. Their unbelievable arrogance was infuriating, but it wasn't their job to make sure our dining experience was pleasurable. The hostess should have recognized the problem and diplomatically helped them redistribute their belongings before seating us. That said, every dish we ordered deserved 5 stars. Every single bite beyond delicious. And our waiter went above and beyond, 5+ stars for him. But if I pay this much for dinner, I expect to be allowed to savor my food without having someone else's purse wedged under my tush.

The key to good food criticism, or any criticism for that matter, is knowing the difference between your own personal taste and an a true understanding of quality and good work, regardless of personal likes. I say this because while I liked or really liked most of what I had at Animal, there was a dish or two that was too sweet for my taste.  But that does not equal bad.  It ust means I don't tend to like appetizers and entrees sweet, but the chef seems to. The foie gras gravy biscuits were rockstar good.  One of my favorite dishes in L.A. The poutine was very good, though it felt like they could have had better fries and better gravy to turn very good to great. The flat iron steak was the weakest of the dishes, but that said, it would spank Wolfgang Puck's Cut's steak any day of the week.  (Cut is the biggest restaurant joke in Los Angeles.) A cool highlight of the meal was the chocolate bacon dessert.  Super rich and kinda weird, it was also mmm mmm satisfying.  If your spouse or fellow diner is hesitant, it's worth a little push.  The bacon is there but not overwhelming. The wine list is varied and decent, but it has room for development.  What's up with the lack of Syrah or good Pinot choices?  Again, they have their specific taste, but you can still count on the fact that everything is well considered. The interior is just functional, but I could care less.  More LA restaurants need to be like this place...all about the food. Good job, guys.

It's like eating at a friends house with good food and the quirks that accompany it. The food served here is great, not super refined but well done and from the heart. It is inventive and pushes the envelope but manages sometimes overemphasizing the whole animal idea, bacon or pork in a good portion of the options is not necessary. Plus you get great wines at down to earth prices, so stop in share a few plates and enjoy some wine. The space is small and loud as is the bar. The servers are really nice and try to manage as busy as it get here and make good suggestions from a menu full of excellent options. Desserts still need some work. Biggest problem is the wait, the kitchen is small and most items are grilled so time table for dishes can take some time so bring good company, order some quick appetizers to bide the time along with some wine. Salads are well prepared and massive, appetizers are tasty, order any dish they do with foie gras and you won't be disappointed. The foie is massive and cooked perfectly, they tend to favor matching it with something sweet i.e. maple syrup, terriyaki, so if that is a problem well try it and then decide. Entrees are well sized portions and prices are reasonable. Not fine dining but a nice step above rustic cuisine trying to expand horizons.

You've gotta love a restaurant whose menu features pig ear, pork belly and a bacon-sprinkled chocolate confection for dessert. Especially when it's located in a historically Jewish neighborhood, across from a kosher deli. Did I mention that the Beastie Boys were playing on the stereo when we walked in? If you want masterfully done eclectic food in taste combos that'll make your jaded foodie palate sing, this is the place. Pork belly sliders, crisp hominy with lime, heirloom tomato salad with ginger vinaigrette, classed-up poutine and more. All served flawlessly, thanks in part to our fantastic waiter, John. Even the cappuccino was nutty and rich. For six tapas-style plates and one Downtown Brown beer, the total tab with tip squeaked in under $100. A bargain for real gourmet food in LA. The only thing that might prevent me from going back? A limited menu of just four main courses -- disappointing. Also, the reservation system requires leaving a message, then having them call you back, then calling them back again to confirm. Kind of time-consuming. Let's hope they move their booking system to http://OpenTable.com.

Ohhhhh Billy!  Goodness, this must be heaven on earth (I swear there were angels singing). Make sure you make reservations well in advance because this place is packed. Went here with my family and girl right after graduation from UCLA, so I was expecting a damn good meal.  Animal, did not disappoint.  It was a slew of meaty goodness coming my way all night long. Started off with the oxtail poutine.  ahhhhhh I could eat this every day.  So good, I recommend all groups getting this to share.  Then I moved on to the foie gras, biscuit and grits drenched in yummy maple sausage gravy.  Probably the most decadent thing I've ever eaten and I could go for 5 more.  It was THAT GOOD.   I decided I wanted to eat something  a little crazy, so I went for the fried veal brains.  WHOA! Not what I was expecting.  The texture was interesting, and little like liver but with a little more structure.  The flavor was very strong, but the lemon butter went well with it.  Jon and Vinny really know what they're doing.  JJ and Dad had the rabbit tenderloin which was excellent (I would order it next time if they have it again). Mom and little brother had the fried quail, which I've had before, and is also a wonderful little surprise. Make sure you get some strongly flavored beer (mmmm Bear Republic Racer 5) or a deep, dark red wine.  You need something to stand up to all the flavors that are so wonderfully thrown at you. As a nice little bonus, turns out that the hostess is an old friend of mine from high school in NorCal! Animal is wonderful restaurant not afraid to take chances.  Everyone needs to go here to indulge and broaden his or her palate.  Bravo!

My friend and I are wannabe foodies. We're doing a tour of the 10 Best Restaurants as mentioned in LA Magazine's January edition. I was up for meat and so the choice was Animal. Being the adventure eaters that we were, we asked for the house's recommendations and then added our own. So we started off with the pig ears with fried egg, oxtail meat and gravy over potatoes, fried and stuffed squash blossoms, shared the pork ribs (portion is sized for sharing) and finished off with the berry tart and bacon chocolate crunch bar. All-in-all it was a fantastic voyage through pork (and beef). It was all tasty, rich and exactly as described to us by the waiter. Food is definitely not cardiologist approved but for someone looking to try something different, Animal does it right. Next question: would we return? I'd probably come back if someone/a group wanted to go somewhere different and was in an adventurous mood.  Their menu changes frequently so you can have a completely new and different experience each time. Sampling the menu seems like the best way to enjoy Animal.  But it's hard to say you could be a "regular" at a place like this. My fear is that I might walk out with a heart attack in a to-go container. The food though has made me curious enough to get the chefs' cookbook and see what I can whip up on my own.

After cancelled reservations and missed opportunities I finally visited Animal  and it was everything I hoped it would be. Great service and fantastic food. Most of their dishes are small plates; even the entrees are smaller than the average restaurant size. I like this because it allowed us to order a bunch of dishes and try multiple flavors. We were tempted to try some of the more unusual dishes, like foie gras on a biscuit or the sweetbreads, but we decided to stick to slightly more conventional stuff. We got 4 dishes plus 2 desserts. First up was the CHICKEN LIVER TOAST. I'm not a big chicken liver guy, but this was very different from the stuff you get at a jewish deli or from grandma. My lady said it was the best she's ever had. It was very creamy and the flavor wasn't overwhelming, which is what usually turns me off to it. Still strong, and I appreciated a big bite of toast to balance it, but very good. Then we got FLUKE AND GRANITA . Granita is like grape flavored water ice, and there were other fruit flavors mixed into the dish. Again, really nice balance of flavors. It was good to have a lighter dish mixed in with the heavier meaty foods, and the granita had added benefit of keeping the fish nice and cool. Next up was our almost-vegetarian dish: BABY BROCCOLI, PANCETTA, PARMESAN, SOFT EGG. Also lighter, really really good. I make baby broccoli a lot at home and its been getting boring; this inspired me to try to mix it with new flavors. Next dish I was really looking forward to, the BARBEQUE PORK BELLY SANDWICHES. Holy Crap. Thick pork belly with bbq sauce and coleslaw on a buttery, fresh roll. So damn good! Hard to not scarf this down like a dog. One bite you get an incredible piece of bbq pork, and the next bite is pure, decadent pork fat. Really f'ing good. Last dish was FLAT IRON STEAK, ARTICHOKE HASH, PARMESAN TRUFFLE FONDUE. I can't say enough about how good that sauce is. I would put that on every meal for the rest of my life. The steak was good, but not the best piece of beef I've had, but slathered in that sauce it didn't matter much. Also, be aware that it was only 10 oz's or so. FYI, I usually order my beef medium-rare, but I went with my instinct and ordered this medium, which was the right thing to do, because medium at Animal is the equivalent of medium-rare at most other places. And to cap it off we had two desserts: the chocolate-bacon crunch bar and the donuts. The BACON CHOCOLATE CRUNCH BAR was great; very rich & creamy. Consistency was somewhere between a mousse and a flourless chocolate cake with 3 flavor layers: bacon, hazelnut and chocolate. Oh and it was topped with an anglais sauce, just because. Very good, but just barely on this side of  too rich. JOE'S DONUTS however, were one of the best desserts I've ever had. You get three of them and they're made to order so they come out hot. A waitress happily explained that they're fried, then rolled in cinnamon-sugar, then covered in a caramel sauce. So, so good. I'm still fantasizing about them 14 hours later. Overall fantastic dinner. Also had a couple glasses of nice red wine. I had a slight issue with the valet (they only have one guy, so you end up waiting a long time), but the hostess noticed and was super nice and helpful which made up for it. Compliments to all the wait staff, everyone was friendly, helpful, and seemed genuinely happy to be working there. Oh, and we also saw Zoe Saldana looking hot and waiting for a table, and separately, Jay Rayner from Top Chef enjoying a meal. I want to go back tonight, and tomorrow night, and the next night nom nom nom...

The foie gras is delicious.  Really delicious.  People aren't lying when they say it's good. However, I found most of the other food .. eh.  So eh.. I can't even remember what the hell we ate. The bacon chocolate cake.. EH (and I love bacon.. maybe it was too overhyped). The tres leches cake. I had better at my niece's birthday party.

FRIED QUAIL. SO TENDER, WELL SPICED, SO GOOD. foie gras loco moco is good but it is a very heavy dish with a gooey texture so not everyone's stomach will approve. fried pig's ear with eggs has a really unique fresh taste but i wouldn't order it again because i felt like i was eating chips...with an egg. tres leches cake is SO GOOD. it wasn't overly sweet or overly moist.  perfectly balanced. what we should of ordered were those pork belly sandwiches....i want some now!  i liked this restaurant because it was pretty unique with inventive dishes.  i often find lots of restaurants all tasting about the same and it's refreshing to be a restaurant that has interesting but DELICIOUS food!

I also wanted to like this place but couldn't.  Everything from the customer service to the food to the no restaurant sign out falls short.  Our server seemed to have a bit of an attitude.  IMO, they are trying to do a gourmet version of some comfort food dishes and end up with comfort food with too much going on while being too expensive. Our favorite dish was the foie gras with biscuit and sausage gravy.  The pig ears had a good flavor but I couldn't tell they were pig ears since they were sliced too thin and fried to a crisp.  As for the foie gras loco moco, I enjoyed the foie gras more without the spam and hamburger with sauce from the local Asian market.  Overall, the food is unrefined and tries too hard impressive. I guess this just isn't my kind of cuisine since this place has a lot of positive reviews.  I prefer cleaner more refined focusing on fresh high quality ingredients.

Need a good excuse to put on 5lbs???  Try Animal!!! Wow, where to begin...  Any place that has fois gras more than once on its menu instantly gets a 5 in my book! Have yet to order something here I didn't like.  Small place, so be sure to make a reservation.  They cram you in, but well worth it.  This is the #1 place in LA to be gluttonous!  Do it! BBQ Pork Belly Sliders - By far one of the best things on the menu.  Unbelievably good! Fois Gras w/ Biscuit - Solid, a great combination. Fois Gras Loco Moco - Really really damn good.  The sauce on this is great, not as rich as you'd expect. I could eat this every night and die happily. Poutine w/ Oxtail Gravy - Cheese fries on steroids.  Fairly rich but the oxtail is a nice touch. Quail Fry - Good, but probably my least favorite.  Very crispy, not oily.

Throw everything you know about food out the window, should you choose to dine here. The combinations going on in virtually every dish seem like they were thrown together by a crazy man. Crazy like a fox. Because they work like gang busters. The foie gras biscuits with maple gravy? What?! Are you kidding? No- it's friggin' genius! As is the steak smothered in parm truffle fondue. Even the bacon for dessert. Next time I'm in LA, this one is at the top of my list. Also, one of the better selections of wines by the glass should you be the one driving home after. -Ok adding to my review after two more visits: The grilled octopus is also amazing as is the calf brains and the lamb cavatelli. And one bite of the pork belly sliders and you'll see god. Also, one new dessert to add to my review, the tres leche is just punch yourself in the face killer. Oh, and the sticky toffee bread pudding aint to shabby either. I guess at this point it is safe to say that this is my favorite restaurant in LA. And top ten worldwide. Bold statements for sure, but I promise it lives up to the hype.

Only been once, but I will be back because I loved the food. We had tried to get in on another night and were told it would be a 2 hour wait, so we left. This time we called and said we would take a spot at the bar. As it turned out they were able to squeeze us in, but don't count on it. The food (which I will get into in a sec) was great, as was the service. I'm only withholding the fifth star because they don't have a full bar. They serve beer and wine, but I prefer more when i go out. OK, now the food. All the plates are small to medium size but perfect to share.  We had the kale salad, which I loved and can be thought of as their version of a ceasar.  Next were the king crab legs in tobasco butter (yum).  I would skip the lamb meatballs, when I go again, but the balsamic ribs are great.  However, no matter what you do, DO NOT MISS the Pork Belly Sliders!  Oh my God!!!  These were perfection!  I have been thinking of a return, just to get the kale salad and sliders.  And next time, I'm not going to share.  We had 2 good desserts, strawberry pound cake and dulce de leche.  We weren't brave enough to try the chocolate bar with bacon, but the table next to us did and they loved it.  Next time, and it will be soon, I will try it.

being half argentinian i am no stranger to animal parts, blood sausage,intestine,sweet breads, bring it on! However, I never thought i could fall in love with with such forbidden delights, such as the ones served at Animal. The location is strange for a place that mainly serves pig parts. its right in the middle of the jewish hood of north fairfax, right across the street from a kosher butcher, and a menorah store. This alone pleased me, and made me wonder why they chose this location, and if their neighbors ever give them grief. There is no sign, and like others said before it was super bare bones. But the food is anything but. My friend and i opted to order a bunch of appetizers since those were the most interesting. I was impressed that they served the food from the mildest-boldest flavor. Actually, i just plain old appreciated that. this is what i ordered and i pretty much recommend it all. lamb meat balls with golden rice- in my humble opinion, lamb is good anyway you cook it. but it is also easy to screw up. these lamb balls should never ever be silenced. Rabbit with country ham spatzel , asparagus and mushrooms- i have always been a rabbit fan as well as a fan of baby animals, but like baby animals bunny is also easy to mess up. however , this was cooked tender and succulent, the country ham was more of a prosciutto, but it really set off the rabbits delicate flavor. Bone marrow w/ chimichuri.  - um i could live off bone marrow. spread on toast creamy and delicious. pig ears and egg- my friend was weary about the pig ear, but i insisted . its my fav part off a suckling pig. i like how they had it cut in to strips. I could have done with out the egg. but the chili and lime on the crispy ears made me wish they sold it as a snack to eat while watching the golden girls marathon. Pork belly sliders- excellent, although my friend said the slaw on in the sandwich overpowered his belly. i didnt think that and could eat that also all day long. Putin with oxtail gravy- um comfort food at its finest. next time i go through a break up i swear to god i am gonna cry in to a plate of this. wtf. the most decadent french fry ever. bacon crunch bar- kinda a disappointment. was not in to the middle chocolate layer. however the layer with bacon was good as was the hazelnut layer. it was just lack luster compared to the rest. anyways, go here . eat animal parts. and dont be afraid.

Believe the hype, people. This place is rock solid. The poutine was the best I've ever had, I could literally not stop eating it. The bone marrow with chimichurri, simply brilliant. And the pork belly sandwiches, in a league all their own. I loved that the waitstaff took the extra time to course out the meal based on what we ordered (lightest to heaviest). So smart and so thoughtful for a shared plates restaurant. And the dessert was to die for, bacon chocolate crunch bar. Best meal in LA by a longshot.

Finally, this place was so difficult to get reservation (by phone only and it was nearly impossible to get a live person during the day on a weekday).  The place was not easy to find.  Parking was hard to find.  The dinner started at 6pm. A long line formed outside for 6pm reservations and bar seating. Got seated, here's what we ordered: chicken liver toast: very tasty, rich, nutty, texture almost like peanut butter, but i couldn't taste the liver flavor. marrow bone, chimichurri, carmelized onions: marrow bone melts like butter but there was no beef flavor pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg: tasty, big flavors, but too much sourness from the lime hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut: the best dish of the night, crispy tostada, fresh herbs, yummy fish, strong fish sauce vinaigrette, crunchy peanuts.  a beautiful looking dish (all the dishes looked great). alaskan halibut, corn, wild fennel, chanterelle, lobster butter: a perfectly cooked halibut but lack some strong flavors and i didn't tasted the lobster butter. barbeque pork belly sandwiches: wow, delicious comfy food.  but when I think of pork belly, I think of bacon.  the pork belly tasted like pulled pork. foie gras, biscuit, maple syrup sausage gravy: very flavorful, rich and filling foie gras dish, biscuit was limp just like the rock band j/k tres leches, dulce de leche: simply tasty cake. bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p ice cream: basically a candy bar with little bacon flavor and salt and pepper ice cream. also: tap water: tasted funny, like from an indoor pool, coffee: okay, mint tea: nice presentation. Outstanding creativity and plating.  That's five star.  Four star on taste.  The best dishes were the hamachi and pork sandwiches.

love it. don't have the $$$ for it, but love it. even the fiance who would normally shy away from foie gras was impressed by the foie gras biscuit. then again, you could spread that maple gravy on a homeless man and it would still taste good. the fiance reprimanded me several times for wiping the bowl with my fingers. and then licking the handle of the spoon after it fell into the sauce. i'm not sorry. it was that good. 1st place: foie gras biscuit AND GRAVY 2nd place: pork belly sliders runner ups: bacon choc crunch bar, chicken liver toast, hamachi

Hit most of the predicted high notes, with some unexpected twists tossed in. I took a friend here to celebrate a birthday, and we split the following: Grilled octopus with chorizo and chowchow - Simply amazing. I already knew the octopus and chorizo would be terrific, but the chowchow, which I was tempted to ignore, really brought it all together. The plate was scraped empty within 5 minutes. Poutine with oxtail gravy - This elicited a guttural moan from both of us after the first bite. It's an explosion of meaty creaminess mixed with crunchy fries. Although we certainly enjoyed the dish, it bordered on being too salty, and could be a bit much for two people to share (in weightiness, not volume). Foie gras loco moco - Another surprise lurked in this dish. Sure, foie, Niman Ranch beef, over-easy quail egg, and Spam are great (OK, maybe not Spam so much), but the rice came out of nowhere. Cooked to a slight crispiness, and soaking up all the juices from the other ingredients, I've never enjoyed non-Asian rice more. This is their signature dish for a reason. Bacon chocolate crunch bar - Probably the low-light of the evening for me. I tasted the bacon bits first, and they were really good. But I lost it among the chocolate and nuts. It was still a wonderful chocolate nut bar, but I expected a slap in the face of bacon flavor, especially if it's the first word in the name of the dish. Between the two of us, the above dishes didn't leave us stuffed, but definitely satisfied. While I'm glad we didn't order more, I probably could have eaten three bowls of fruit afterward, if that makes any sense. Service was courteous and low-key. Drinks were refilled frequently enough. A little bit of a wait in between courses, but part of that was probably due to the Donner Party-like voraciousness with which we attacked each plate as it arrived. Besides, delicious food always negates service peccadilloes, as far as I'm concerned. I will be back.

I was really unsatisfied. Yes, everything is tasty, but was not worth the price. Maybe if considered a $$$$ restaurant it would rate a little better in my perspective. In our party of 4, each of us pitched in about $30, and 3/4 of us walked away hungry. Again, I went with 4 people total, which I would not recommend. It's delicious gourmet food with gourmet food portions and they recommend eating family style. This does not work. Go with 2 people max in order to actually taste each plate. Again, I have to give the place credit. They make some unique meals out of a tiny kitchen. But the food comes out slowly and the popular pork belly sandwiches? It didn't really amaze anyone in my party and we were all sick afterwards. It's amazing because it's decadent and fatty, not because it has any interesting flavors. Go here only if you like spending money and taste testing, not if you want a satisfying meal.

Came here to celebrate a birthday, and our entire party was pleased with everything we ordered, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu and service was also friendly and attentive. It is a little small and the tables are placed very close together, but not a deal breaker for me, it is definately worth the visit. My favorite item was the braised oxtail french fries.

For people like myself, who believe the best parts of cattle, pork and fowl are the ones not found on traditional steakhouse menus, this is your Xanadu.  Went with a party of 5, and we tried just about everything on the menu - it was all amazing.  Some highlights: - Chicken Liver Toast: a pate of chicken liver on toast with a strip of sweet, balsamic-y sauteed onion on top.  At $3 a pop, get a bunch of these, they are like crack (not that I've had crack, but from what I've been told). - Marrow Bone with Chimichurri and Carmelized Onion: this was one of the largest bones, with the most amount of marrow I'd ever seen.  Very good - chimichurri and onions providing a good accompaniment to the fatty/rich marrow. - Melted Petit Basque, Chorizo, Grilled Bread: a much better version of the Mexican restaurant standard queso fundido. - BBQ Pork Belly Sandwiches w/ Slaw: two sliders with a large piece of bbq's pork belly who's richness and bbq sweetness was cut with the cool slaw. - Veal Brains, Vadouvan, Apple Sauce and Carrot: my first time trying Veal Brains and they have a similar richness and tender texture as sweetbreads. - Potato Agnolotti, Rabbit Sausage, Broccoli and Olive Oil: some of the best pasta I've had (on par with Osteria Mozza) - ravioli-like pillows stuffed with sausage. - Poutine, Oxtail Gravy, Cheddar: one of the favorites at the table - french fries covered with a rich, meaty oxtail gravy. - Foie Gras, Biscuit, Maple Sausage Gravy: overall favorite of the group - a large seared piece on foie gras on top of a biscuit smothered in the gravy.  The most decadent dish of the evening (and that's saying a lot). - Foie Gras Loco Moco, Quail Egg, Spam, Hamburger: a play on the Hawaiian dish - with the meats and egg stacked, this dish is way better tasting than it probably sounds.

Exceptional; Actually deserves 5 stars. I take exception to the rampant "overrating" so prominent amongst Yelpers- but this place truly deserves the big stars. We enjoyed: Gnocchi in Liver sauce- light, pillowy puffs in a rich, not heavy cream with a mushroom of some kind? Kale with pecorino or parmensan, great acid, kind of contorni, but served crudo- basic and excellent. Octopus tandoori; c'mon i need more on the plate- really well executed, complex flavors in the fruit component and the yogurt on the plate Pigs Head; this was a fried disc of pork's head terrine with a remoulade of sorts; pretty good- not amazing after all this we had to order one more tapas size plate- Fois Gras Biscuit; just what it says, buttery biscuit with a fois gras slice served in a rediculous white sausage gravy with maple syrup.... this really could have been a desert- it was overly rich and amazing and we could have stopped there- but we went on to the Bacon Chocolate bar: I dont really care for desert- I focus more on the savory; but (at the risk of hyperbole) This is soft crunchy bar served with a salty vanilla? ice cream and a dusting of de-hydrated nutella, was the best dessert I have had, at least in adult memory. Service was solid; well informed on wine list.... all in all excellent. WE were late and seated promptly... but seriuosly i would come back even if the service/atmosphere werent great.

Food is definitely original.  Ordered: Chicken liver toast (excellent) Radish/lamb fat appetizer (not worth ordering) Veal brains (definitely worth ordering, at least a try) hamachi tostada (basically fresh sushi with a kick due to some spicy raw chiles and a green cabbage slaw) Sticky toffee pudding (yummy) Really worth an experience.  I didn't order some of the best sellers (foie gras terrine, bbq pork belly sandwiches), but I liked this place enough that I would go back and try it. service is fast/efficient. Cons: long wait if you don't have a reservation.

Who doesn't love a food orgy right? With different foods, taste and textures all happening at the same time it's orgasmic.  A Fellow yelper (Anna W.) told me to check out a restaurant named Animal. With a quick call to get reservations when I first arrived in LA, I soon found out that this place must be pretty busy as the first available reservation was at 10:00pm for the next night.   The restaurant does not have a sign so it is easily missed. It is located near some bars and art galleries. This particular area was heavily populated with hipsters.  How do they wear those tight ass jeans? Upon entering the restaurant, you'll notice that it is has a minimalist décor, a narrow space, dimly lit area with music playing in the background.  There was a small bar in the very back of the restaurant. Greeted by a very cute hostess (she looks like Annie from the show "Community"), she indicated that the table would be a few minutes and asked if we would like something to drink while we waited. We had a few drinks and waited for about 10 minutes. Let the food orgy begin: Chicken Hearts - I love me some chicken hearts and these were cooked to perfection. I mean I love the chewy texture and taste. The lima bean, baba ghanoush and yogurt worked well with the chicken hearts. Chicken Liver Toast - The liver and garlic made this taste like Haven. I didn't really like the caramelized onions. Marrow Bone - This was my favorite dish. The bone was cut right in half and the bone marrow was exposed with some chimichurri. The soft texture and the creamy taste was amazing. I could have licked the bone. Pig Tail - The meat just melted off the tail bone. The pig tail was drenched in buffalo style sauce. This was one of my least favorite dish because it had too much of the sauce. BBQ Pork Belly - The pork was cooked to perfection inside slider burgers. There was also a side of Slaw. Pig Ears -I've eaten my fair share of pig ears growing up and I've always enjoyed the chewy and hard textures. These pig ears went great with my beer. Quail fry - It was quail fry, grits, chard, slab bacon with maple syrup. I didn't enjoy this dish as the maple syrup made the dish too sweet for me. Sweetbreads - Another great dish, which included creamed spinach, capers, oyster mushroom. This was a very creamy dish and the crispy texture was wonderful. Foie Grass - It was accompanied by a biscuit and maple sausage gravy. This was another sweet dish. As you might have notice I don't really enjoy really sweet dishes. It was an ok dish. Poutine- It was fries with oxtail gravy and cheddar. This was the last dish and it was so hard to finish. Don't get me wrong it was good but I was full. The service was great and the atmosphere was too. After this food orgy, I was so stuff I couldn't even move! So if you get a chance come check out this place because the menu changes too. Don't hate me because I'm a food whore!!!!

I went to animal twice in a month, in June. I thought I reviewed it then, but I didn't so here goes. 99% of what we ate was super tasty, including the salads, and the whites on the wine list are well edited. We had just about everything on the appetizer list, and it was all good, except... Do not eat the duck hearts. They probably just ordered a stash out of some perversion, but they are terrible in texture and appearance, and I doubt anything could be done to make them tasty. My brother ate a bunch of them, regretting every chew. But he can't waste food. The bacon chocolate: pretty damn good, even for someone who doesn't like the choc. Nice, spare, clean space. I like.

Animal tastes like it sounds, nearly overwhelming in flavor and not short of protein.  The casual atmosphere was a welcomed change to stuffy white table cloth decor.  While the décor was casual, the food certainly was anything but.   The pork belly sliders, fried quail, and flat iron steak with fondue truffle were as good as they sound, however, the real stand outs are the foie gras on a biscuit with a maple bacon reduction and the rip eye with escargot.  I also enjoyed the Loco Moco (Foie, Spam, Hamburger), however it wasn't quite as good as expected, largely due to the hamburger being just okay (after having a host of appetizers you come to expect much more than just okay).  The wine list is certainly one of the best in the city, which makes up for their lack of a full bar.  Dan's Doughnuts are truly the desert to be desired, I found the bacon chocolate crunch bar a bit too trying.

Dear Animal, Holy cow (pig, boar, etc.)!  Who knew that pigs ears could be so tasty? I can't really think of anything substantive to add to all the glowing reviews that others have posted about you, but here are some thoughts...   The Good: -The Flat Iron Steak.  The sauce is so good you'll lick the plate.   -The Baby Broccoli.  Who knew that the egg would add so much to it? -The Pork Belly Sandwiches: !@#$%^ Unreal.   -The Tres Leches Cake.  One of the best desserts anywhere in LA.   -The Hostess.  Thank you so much for always taking care of us.  Even when we don't have  a reservation. ;) -The Busser.  Older gentleman that is always so friendly and attentive.  He's a star.  Don't lose him. The Bad: -Sorry, I got nothin'. *Update:  Many thanks to Ashley and Jessica for taking care of  our Oscar Sunday dessert needs!  The Tres Leche was the hit of the party.

I rarely write reviews unless really good or bad and Animal was amazing!  I went with 3 girlfriends to optimize our ability to taste as many things as possible. I have to say that it exceeded my expectations. We ordered about 12 items which were almost all amazing. The standout items for me were the bone marrow, kale, foie gras with biscuit, poutine, flat iron, sweetbreads, and cavatelli with lamb sausage. Soooo good. The desserts were also good, but I was so full by the time we got to them, that I don't think I could appreciate them as much. Also, the house cab for $20 was a steal. The bill was very reasonable and actually less then I thought it would be. Go, but make reservations!

THE FOOD My partner and I went to Animal to kick off a night of celebration for her birthday.  We decided to split five plates and a bottle of white wine.  Here's what we had in the order it was served: FOIE GRAS TERRINE WITH PICKLED CRAB APPLE.  Delicious, though the terrine was a little too cold and the crab apple a little too sweet.  But a fine contrast in flavors and a nice start to the meal. BUFFALO STYLE PIG TAILS.  Great preparation, though it could have got to us a little more quickly since it was just barely warm when it arrived.  Nice mix of fried goodness, spiciness, and creaminess.  Maybe not for everyone with the super crunchy texture.  But we liked it. GRILLED OCTOPUS WITH CHORIZO.  The highlight of the meal.  Smoky, tender octopus.  Just the right amount of chorizo.  The accompanying chow-chow was a little too sweet, much like crab apple from the first course.  My sense is that the cooks favor the savory-sweet contrast.  But I just left the chow-chow on the plate and contentedly focused on the delightful octopus. VEAL BRAINS WITH APPLE AND VADOUVAN.  The brains were perfectly cooked.  "I never expected brains to seem so creamy," my partner remarked.  I thought that the spicing could have been a little more aggressive/hot, but, at the risk of harping on it, the sweet-savory contrast won out again with the apple-brain combo.  Thank goodness we ordered a tart white wine that cleansed the palate. OXTAIL POUTINE.  A large platter of good grub.  The oxtail was really delicious and plentiful.  The fries were well-executed, though not the best high-end fries around.  My only gripe was that it was a little too salty. OVERALL, a strong showing of technique with the proteins.  The preparations could have played with more herbs, aggressive spicing, and acidic notes.  But that may just be my palate.  I know some of y'all "honor the protein" fanatics think that dressing up your meat and offal is a crime. THE SERVICE A little confusing at the get-go since it seemed like two waiters were battling to serve our table.  But eventually one of them won out.  He didn't offer much help with the menu, but he did direct us to a terrific wine.  Not much interaction during the meal, but it was a busy night. Things took a major dive, however, when we got to the bill.  We had been charged double for everything we ordered.  The hostess happened by to ask about our meal and I pointed out the bill and she said that there had been a mix-up when our order went in and she'd fix it.  I gave her my card.  Then our waiter returned with my card and the bill and sprinted off before I noticed that we were still being charged double.  The hostess returned and said, "Oh, he put that through, I didn't think he'd get to it."  So she took my card again and charged me the correct amount, but then told me that it would take a day or two for them to void the doubled bill payment.  Just make sure to keep an eye on my account to make sure that they don't forget.  So I ended up paying for three meals instead of one and it seems to be my responsibility to follow up on their error.  The original waiter came by and said, "Thanks for catching that bill.  Sorry about that." Now, the really bad.   The double-charge triggered my bank's fraud alert software and my card was frozen.  So when when we went out on the town for a show and drinks later, I couldn't charge anything and my partner ended up paying for everything on her own birthday.  I don't suppose that this is completely Animal's fault, but I do hold a slight grudge.  I mean not one but two of the front of house people dropped the ball.  (The waiter also said he would bring us the wine label so we could remember the name but forgot to, but that's no big deal.)  And neither of them seemed very apologetic.   SUMMARY If it weren't for the errors with the service, I think I would put Animal in the regular rotation of restaurants.  The chefs do create some imaginative and fun dishes.  But it's hard to get over the bitter aftertaste of a messed up birthday night.

Pure awesomeness!! Went here on a wednesday night for my birthday thinking it'll be easy to get a table since its wednesday night...NOT!! Even Billy Zane could not get a table, so I think he and his date settled for the bar. Me, the hubby  and  friends settled for a 1015 reservation. It was my first time here, initially I didn't wanna wait  but since I am intrigued w/ the rave reviews and my husband and friends didn't seem to mind we decided to go ahead and reserve the a table at 1015. In the mean time we decide to go to father's office (w/c will be in my next review) Soooo glad we waited. The food was excellent!! Pig's ear w/ eggs (its animal's version of popular filipino dish called SISIG) Foie gras w/ biscuit and maple sauge gravy (the highlight of our meal) Bone marrow w/ chimichuri and caramelized onion w/ buttered bread Melted petit basque Sweet bread w/ creamed spinach, capers and oyster mushrooms and for dessert we had  tres leches and bacon chocolate cruch bar... I can't wait to go back and try the other dishes, price was unbelievably reasonable, service was excellent. Dont even try coming w/ out a reservation unless like me you're willing to have dinner after 10pm.

Let me start by saying that I was expecting a lot when coming here and my expectations were obviously met, hence the 5 star rating. I hate giving 5 stars, because I tend to think people who give everything 5 stars aren't really getting the point of 5 stars, which is to say that a place is outstanding and beyond belief or in the words of the Michelin guide, "worth the journey" (for their prized and elusive 3 star rating). And after understanding all that, I would like to say that this place is 5 stars. People who give this place below 4 stars either came on a really really off day or can't appreciate fine dining (i.e. "a burger is a burger, a steak is a steak"). No it is not. Rather than give the run down of all the various delectable delights like the pork belly sandwich, the bacon brownie thingy, the tres leches cake,  the chicken liver toast, the kale salad...they were all amazing and I would order it all again. But, let me just say this: Get the foie gras loco moco. Oh my goodness, this is the closest thing to manna we have on this side of eternity. Quail egg, spam, juicy meat patty topped with a healthy piece of seared foie gras, surrounded by rice drenched with heavenly juices. Yes, its steep at 35 dollars. But if I were stranded on a island and could either bring 35 jumbo jacks or 1 foie gras loco moco, I would rather get the foie gras loco moco and live one day in bliss than 35 days in misery.

So after all the hype and all the attempts at getting a decent reservation time, I finally tried Animal last night with a good friend.  First of all let me just say that I LOVE the concept and I'm a big fan of animal parts (tongue, ears, brains, ears, tails, you name it).  That said the food here was just OK.  Nothing special.  Maybe it was all the hype and press exposure that had given me high expectations, but nothing we tried, and we tried about 7 dishes really impressed me at all.  The best thing on the menu was the Fois Gras with the biscuit and maple gravy, but even that was just good, not AMAZING.  The Crispy fried pig ears were not crispy enough and a bit chewy, the veal brains were bland and needed more seasoning or something, the pork ribs were super sweet and I've had better at a rib joint, the Hamachi salad & tres leches cake were both good,  Anyway, I love the concept, but I wish I was blown away by this place after all the hype.  BAR TARTINE in San Francisco which has a similar concept blows this place out of the water!

Rock cod, was okay...tasted like it was frozen not fresh. Foie Gras on biscuit with gravy: it was good but I have had many other preparations that I enjoyed more, The pig ear with lime, chili, and fried egg was the highlight of the evening, the flavors and textures were interesting, salty, spicy, it was PERFECT.  Finished off with the french fries topped with oxtail meat (i believe) it was SUPER RICH. All and all a good experience, don't think I need to do it again. Thanks though!

It was a fine meal, but somewhat disappointing for the price.  We had the petit basque, which is basically a melted cheese dish served with bread, where you spread the cheese over the bread.  Not too impressed. Then we had the ribs, which, true to what other reviews say, were moist and falling off the bone, but the sauce was a bit too barbequee. We also split the flat iron steak, which was the highlight of the meal. That was good. Really good.Not amazing, but worth the $. The low point of the meal was the fois gras.  Truly disappointing. They served the fois gras over a biscuit with gravy.  I tried to keep an open mind.  But the gravy totally overpowered the fois gras -- it made no sense. All in all, I've had much better meals for less money.  Service was excellent, the ambiance was great --- the main course was great.  But the apps were less than worth it, and since we ordered 3 apps, it wasn't worth it.

(From a meal two months ago) A carnivore's delight... I'm biased because I do think that pigs are the tastiest animals, and as many yelpers have stated, there's pork everywhere on the menu.  Imagine my surpise when I found the tastiest entree to be my date's sea bass (if I remember correctly) topped with crab.  The kim chi pork belly appetizer was a true fusion delight.  Sweetbread appetizer was only average, a little overbreaded.  I can't comment on the bacon chocolate bar, as they were out. The ambiance is austere, but if you are there only to eat, who cares.  Not a particularly romantic outing, however. Service was outstanding the night we went.  Seems like there have been some negative posts on service, but our waitress was exceptionally friendly.  My sister commented that we didn't really like rose wines, and she then proceeded to pour us three half glasses to sample -- on the house.  Still didn't order any, but a great touch.  We were extremely hungry and looking at surrounding diners plates; the other waiters noticed, and proceeded to stop breifly at our table to present other people's food for our inspection. I can't quite give a five star rating, only because of the innate foodie in me, but certainly a restaurant I will be back to.

I really liked this place.   I had the pork chops with grilled apple.  Simply divine.  For dessert, the chocolate pudding hit the spot.  The food was remarkable and the ambiance simple and down-home.  The wait staff was very helpful. My wife and I arrived early on a Friday and the place was empty except for one occupied table.  Regardless, the hostess stuck us at the bar explaining that the place would soon be full of folks who reserved tables.   After our dinner, the place was about 3/4 full, with more than a few empty tables looking lonely.

Great, no-frills restaurant that makes the most delicious dishes from mostly local and seasonal produce.  We were drawn to the place after sampling their Pork Belly w/ Kimchi at the LA Weekly Gold Standard event a few weeks before.  Of course we had to order that dish again, but we also ordered several other starters including the Crispy Hominy, Melted Petit Basque w/ Chorizo, and Poutine w/ Oxtail Gravy. Everything was great.  It was only the second time I've had Poutine, fries with cheese curds and brown gravy.  The first time was in Montreal, Quebec where the dish is from and now I'm definitely a fan.  There were four of us and we smartly ordered one entree to share which was the Balsamic Pork Ribs (full rack!) and it was perfectly cooked such that the meat fell off the bone.  We barely had room left for dessert: Tres Leches and Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar, both fantastic! Animal is definitely one of my favorite new restaurants.  My only nit is that they pretty much brought everything out at once.  The waiter asked us in the beginning if we would like everything as it was ready, but we didn't expect everything to be ready so quickly.  If you go, make sure that they pace everything so you can enjoy the food...and company.

Everything we had was great, if you are reading these reviews because you are considering going, trust me, GO!

After a long day of weaving in and out of LA traffic, what a delight to dine at Animal. We got a late reservation and even around 11-ish, this place was packed! Nice dining environment,... minimal and very clean. Staff was great! We never had to ask for anything. Food was delicious! My significant other and I shared a few things... (1) heirloom tomato with a ginger garlic vinaigrette (2) quail fry, grits, slab bacon, chard, maple jus (3) pork belly with kimchi, peanuts, chili soy, scallion and (4) foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy. The foie gras was the fav dish of the night. We savored every bite. Mm..mm...good. Close second was the pork belly... but every thing was so fresh and flavorful! Would definitely visit again when in LA!

I came here to appease my extremely carnivorous boyfriend under the impression that  I'd probably just have a salad and some wine while he barbarically gnawed away at something that used to be named Wilbur.  But later this proved not to be the case as, while waiting at valet,  phantom flavors haunted my tongue from the best damned ribs I ever-did-eat! Our waiter was a little akward. I had to ask what a few things were on the menu such as girl pomodoro, oaxacan cheese, amberjack, poutine, & oxtail gravy and when asked his opinion on a particular dish he would respond with an enthusiastic "duuuuude.... its awesome" We decided to share a few appetizers and a nice plate of ribs.  I'm not the most adventurous when it comes to meat so i started things off with the arugula salad. It was fantastic! Apples, grapes, freshly shaved parmesn and a delicate white balsamic dressing. Yummy. Then we got the BBQ pork belly sliders- and, holy crap, they were tender and delicious. Our third appetizer was melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread- a plate of  melted cheese with little pepperoni slices and 4 big pieces of bread to sop it up- nothing  a couple trips to Runyon Canyon couldn't work off. Then came The Mothership. Balsamic pork ribs & succotash with herb butter- and a very generous portion to boot! The ribs were juicy and tender, the sauce: bold thick and velvety. It was GOOOOOOD. We could only finish half since the appetizers were almost a meal in themselves. No worries, I'm sure the leftovers will turn into delectable bbq pork sandwiches over the next few days. All in all this was a great experience. My boyfriend said that, if he were a viking returning from a long excursion of raping and pillaging, this would be his first choice in the Kosher restuarant section of lower  Fairfax- the slums of Beverly Hills. A great place to take an out of town visiter too. Los Angeles trendy atmosphere with middle America buttery flesh cuisine.

4 stars for having downtown brown... 1 star for the small glass (this is the joke part) 1 star for service... they lost our pork slider order, we waited 30 min before asking and the excuse was something like "oh well you had the calamari which is a lighter dish and we space out the plates"... id much prefer a "sorry we forgot" then a random excuse when we saw everyone who ordered right before us and right after us get all their small plates one after the other.  and 30 min is not normal spacing for small plates. that being said, 4 stars for the sliders it was pretty awesome but after i finished mine in ... 45 sec i was like... fuck that might be the quickest 5 dollar slider ive ever eaten. 1 star for the ribs.  i know the menu says "modifications will be politely declined" but i'd like to tell them TOO MUCH SAUCE!! and TOO SALTY!! I love ribs and the texture was right, fall off the bone... but it tasted like it had been soaked in brine for too long and then a ton of sauce on top.  not very appetizing. i was actually pretty pist. 3 stars for the flat iron which was cooked well and seasoned right.   so i dunno if that comes out to 2 stars but i felt maybe 1 was too harsh since i liked the sliders.  i will probably not eat there again.

I went here with 3 girl friends and the place was absolutely amazing! Location - easy to find if you have the exact address. We were a little confused if it was THE restaurant since there isn't a name on the windows or on any signs but the number said 435 so we walked in. It was a little strange asking the host if it was The Animal Restaurant. Started with: - baby broccoli salad - it was beyond expectations. I loved the dressing and the chinese broccoli (I had thought it was regular broccoli). The pancetta was also the perfect touch on top. - rabbit loin - crispy on the outside because of the bacon and tender on the inside. main: loco moco hamburger. one word - spam! who knew it'll add something to the already delicious dish? The rice and gravy was also very good. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because I didn't like the chocolate-bacon bar. The bacon bits were very yummy but it was too much chocolate. However, the donuts were great! get that instead.

I highly recommend going in a large group in order to maximize menu damage. I went with a group of 8 so we were able to sample a good portion of the dishes. Must try: Foie gras w/ biscuit & sausage gravy (heavenly), oxtail poutine (I could have licked the plate clean), foie gras loco moco, marrow bone OK: Pig ears (tasted almost like crunchy bacon), baby broccoli, flatiron steak, crispy hominy, BBQ pork belly sandwiches (not sure why pork bellies are the new black but it was a little too fatty and saucy for me). Don't bother: Sweetbread - It was fried and not all that flavorful but then again I'm not a huge fan to begin with. Bacon chocolate was meh too. It was a plain old chocolate bar with a sprinkle of bacon. I was expecting more bacon goodness. Service was great, the food was great...all in all a good experience. Will it be one of my fav restaurants to go to? No. But it was an awesome try....definitely something new in LA. Tips: There is no sign outside so look for the valet right in front. It's next to a hipster clothing store and two stores down from Canter's Deli. Animal is not a place for the health conscious or weak of heart. If you are a finicky eater and non-adventurous, this isn't the place for you.

Pasquale called and said, "you've gotta try the pigs ear at Animal". Came in for a glass of wine while they finished their dinner, saw the menu, and had to order a few small plates. My brother and I shared the fried hominy, pigs ear, lamb meatballs, tried the sweetbread and had the chicken livers. I thought the chicken liver and sweetbreads were excellent. Maybe the best I've had for both dishes. The chicken liver was on toast with a homemade berry jam. The rich creamy organ meat and the sweet jam reminded me of an adult peanut butter and jelly sandwich taste. The sweetbreads were coated and fried to perfection. The lamb plate was nicely executed. familiar dish. The pigs ear wasn't as disturbing on the plate as it sounds (no pun intended). The ear was sliced into thin strips, fried and mixed with vinegar and hot pepper sauce, and topped with an egg. The acid was a little out of balance, too much vinegar. The wine list was very good, mostly French and Italian, and most were about $40/bottle, and all served by the carafe. Also a big positive, is that a place like this is open late, until 2 am. Hard to found a place of this caliber open late into the evening. Go check it out.

This place is super yummy!  Wanted to order everything on the menu, but just couldn't do it.  Here's what we sampled: *Melted Petite Basque, chorizo, grilled bread *Foie Gras Loco Moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger *Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar (basically, frites with crazy topping) *Sweetbreads, creamed spinach, capers, hen of the woods *Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar Wish we could have tried more, but, we were very full even after these guys.  Nice wine list and staff was very knowledgeable, didn't pressure us as we slowly enjoyed and had a nice dinner.  Simplistic restaurant, packed by foodies, but not too loud.  Casual spot, but one of our favorites ever.  Street parking on a Friday night was not difficult.  Even on a rainy day, place was packed.

You will never find something like this in any other restaurants in LA. FOIE GRAS is the reason why you're there. It was a duck's liver (which is about to go illegal in California, so get it fast) with a biscuit, they just melted in your mouth. Worth the price. The farm-feel of the place is so cozy, but loud.

I have been wanting to go here for a long time now and last night after a fight with my fiancé about our plans that evening, we ended up there. We waited at the bar for about 10 minutes before we were sat which felt like 3 minutes thanks to a very helpful and friendly bartender named Jeff. After ordering a carafe of their Dupere and gaining some knowledge from Jeff about what we shouldn't miss on the menu we sat down at the table. Our first dish two dishes were the hamachi tostada and the raddichio salad with buttermilk dressing, pistachios and oranges. Really great way to kick things off. Both were excellent, subtle and wonderfully constructed. I was really surprised at how much I liked the salad. Oranges and pistachios, who knew? Then...it came. Our next dish was the much talked about pork belly sliders. When they came out I was pleased with the presentation because they didn't look like they had been slapped together with sauce,slaw and a bun. These things were bathed, shaved and dressed to impress. I took the first bite as my fiancé watched on in anticipation of my reaction. Usually if something is delicious we widen our eyes and repeatedly point to the dish while chewing. But this time I could do no such thing. I was in a place I haven't been before. A place that made me think that maybe I am missing out on a whole world of tastes that I never knew existed. In hindsight I feel like I should go on a quest to discover more tasty dishes like this one. But in the moment I couldn't think of that, because I couldn't think. My senses were hijacked and I was a willing and very happy victim. I realized after a few moments that my fiancé had been asking me how it was and laughing because I hadn't lifted my head from staring at the sandwich and now was looking straight up to God. I think I may have audibly thanked  Him for allowing foods like this to be experienced. My fiancé took her first bite and it was more if the same. We hardly talked during this round in fear of missing a moment if pork belly bliss. Our last dish was the fois grais( don't know how to spell it) with country biscuit and gravy.  Three words. Holy. Crap. ThatwassomegoodshitIwantsomemore. We stopped there so that we have more reasons to come back. Because this is now our new favorite place.

Moo Moo Oink Oink Quack Quack Gobble Gobble Please all come to my tummy. Meow Meow and Woof Woof, stay away from Animal! Animal is so cool that is doesn't even need a sign outside.  You're just supposed to be able to tell from the nondescript building that this is it.  Anyway, I found the ambiance to be kind of lacking.  The space is rectangular in shape and too tight with no place for people to wait to be seated. The three of us were seated at a table for 2 but there was another table for 2 next to us that remained empty throughout our meal.  It would've been nice to have more space but I guess we had a very intimidate girls dinner. We ordered the following: Chicken Liver Toast ($3) - This was my favorite.  It's one piece of toast, but it's one large piece. Whatever was on top of the pate  was amazing. Pig Ear, Chili, Lime, Fried Egg ($12) - I had very low expectations for this but it was actually quite delicious. The pig ear was crispy and fried like onion strings. The lime was very strong. Hamachi Tostada, Herbs, Fish Sauce Vinaigrette, Peanut ($14) - I remember this being very delicious but the presentation could have been improved. It was just a huge pile of stuff and the tostada was a bit difficult to cut into pieces to share. Barbecue Pork Belly Sandwich, Slaw ($12) - In terms of flavor, this was excellent but it just didn't feel as "special" as the other items on the menu. Marrow Bone, Chimichurri, Caramelized Onions ($10) - Perhaps I'm not sophisticated enough but I did not like the marrow. Quail Fry, Grits, Chard, Slab Bacon, Maple Jus ($16) - Basically a lightly fried mini-chicken.  How could you go wrong? Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar, S&P Anglaise ($7) - Very rich and delicious.  The bacon tasted great! The food was excellent and the service was very good.  I was surprised at the relatively affordable price considering the fact that we ordered 6 appetizer/entrees, 1 dessert and a bottle of wine. At just $50 a person, it was an excellent deal.

i LOVE this new trend of reviving tasty animal parts that have been shunned by western american society.  finally the culinary cowboys out there are taking risks and going balls out (no pun intended) with their menus and putting out dishes like chicken hearts, liver, and pig ears along.  usually u would only see these items on an "ethnic" menu, animal brings us a high end version drawing inspiration from all over the map.  grilled octopus, chicken liver toast, foie gras biscuits and gravy!!!   ventured to animal to kick off a delicious food filled weekend when a friend visited from nor cal. we excitedly enter the small simple setting for our 9:45pm reservation.  of course we've already studied the menu earlier that day and gave our server our extensive order for four almost immediately after ordering our wine. chicken liver toast: full of liver flavor with a fruit (maybe some vinegar) compote on top that cut thru the richness of the liver pate beautifully.  but be warned, one person at our table didn't particularly care for the taste of liver and was not a fan of this dish hamachi tostada: forgettable, hamachi is probably better enjoyed at a sushi bar grilled octopus with sausage: some of the most tender grilled octopus i've ever had, it takes so much skill not to overcook the octopus...well done. chicken heart salad: i never knew chicken hearts could be so tender!  such a good balance of flavors and acidity with the tomatos and greens and sauce.   crispy pig ears topped with an egg: i grew up eating pig ears marinated chinese style that celebrated the crunch of the cartilege and gelatinous skin, full of porky flavor.  so this dish was probably the biggest disappointment.  they were so fried that i could have been eating chips, we all felt that it lost all the integrity of the pig ears.  i guess it would be a good starter for a first time pig ear eater. bone marrow: good, but the chimchurri was a bit overpowering...i like the bone marrow at a couple other places better pork belly sliders: one person at the table absolutely loved it, i didn't think it was creative enough and my slider had way too much bbq sauce that masked the star of the dish, the pork belly foie gras biscuits and gravy: our favorite at the whole table by far!  reactions included "is this what foie gras is supposed to taste like?!  now i know what the big deal is all about!"  "should we get another one?"  "that sauce is sooo good, i wanna lick the bowl" "that dish is genius" foie gras loco moco: oh yes we did, we ordered both foie gras dishes and we liked the biscuit and gravy one better, not saying that the loco moco version was bad...it just had a hard act to follow. flat iron steak with truffle sauce: this steak was drenched in the creamy truffle sauce, we're talking swimming in it.  it was ok for me, the steak was a bit over done for medium rare, but that might just be cause i got an end piece.  also after everything we sampled thus far...the truffle sauce actually seemed a little boring to me. poutine oxtail cheddar: amped up chili cheese fries!  instead of chili, u get this rich robust braised and shredded oxtail in this amazing cheddar sauce...great way to end the meal... uhhhh...sorry no opinion about desserts...we just didn't have room...BRAVO animal for your bravado!

Phenomenal...absolutely delicious...amazingly palate pleasing...an indulgence...need I say more? The order: Foie Gras x 3 styles; apricot jam, gravy & biscuits, loco moco Pork Belly Sandwich Bone Marrow (2 orders) Liver Toast (2 orders) Pig Ears w/Fried egg Tres Leches Tip for 1st timers:  We split everything in to fourths allowing us to get a variety of dishes. My tip is to also dine with a party of 4, not only the more the merrier but the menu is quite interesting.  Surely deserves a place on my favorites list.

Vegetarians need not apply.  This place is for the meat lovers.  And not just that, but organ meat lovers.  Don't come here if you are a finicky eater.  You have to be semi-adventurous to dine here and be satisfied.  This probably isn't the best place to take a girl on the first date but maybe once you're more comfortable with each other and you know she won't squirm at the thought of eating exotic meats. Boom! Get it done. Don't ask me why. Just do it.

finally found my way to this joint.  we ordered 8 dishes, 4 hits and 4 misses. hits: foie gras with maple sausage gravy, rabbit sausage gnocchi, thai bbq quail, and chicken liver on toast. misses: pig ears, pork belly sliders, bone marrow, and bacon chocolate crunch bar.  not that they were bad, they just didn't meet the expectations.  pig ears, bone marrow, and pork belly were too heavily sauced, and the crunch bar was just meh. the hits definitely showed that there is potential in the other dishes that we didn't order... will definitely come back and try the other items.

OK, we admit we're definitely FOODIES, so to go to a place one night, and return the next, it MUST be even more than BABULOUS, right?  Well, we actually DID eat ourselves silly two nights in a row at ANIMAL, and truthfully, we'd have made it three or quite possibly, four more times JUST to get through each and every item on the innovative menu. It's no wonder we are OBSESSED considering the owners are Food Network's Star Chefs, Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo. Located in the "borscht belt" on North Fairfax Avenue, this little hole-in-the-wall  has NO SIGN,  and...it's actually VERY reminiscent of the gourmet-as-you-go storefront restaurants in both NY and SF calling the name of gourmands of all ages. We haven't had every single item on the menu... YET, but we CAN tell you what's the absolute BEST in our book and YES, in the entire city! CHICKEN LIVER TOAST HAMACHI TOSTADA with Peanuts POUTINE...(Oxtail Gravy and FRIES are BEYOND yummy!!!!!) PIG EARS with Chile, Lime and Fried Egg PORK BELLY SLIDERS QUAIL  FRY with Grits, Maple au jus and Chard FOIE GRAS on a Muffin with Gravy (omg!!!) TRES LECHES, Dulce de Leche CHOCOLATE BACON CRUNCH BAR Don't think the above can EVER be beat, but with these "two dudes," who knows? For those of you "out-of-towners" we present to you Vinny and Jon's book TWO DUDES ONE PAN.

Had an amazing meal last night! Our first time and we went crazy and made a meal of apps...nine to be exact. We were able to get a good sense of the chefs' vision and talent. The dishes went from great to amazing with the fabulous waitress organizing the flow to perfection. The dishes were all simple in the individual components but complex in their construction. The flavor pairings were sometimes startling and a great surprise. Ashley, our waitress was extremely professional yet warm and welcoming completing the whole experience. Bravo to the team!

FOOD: Delicious! Split five appetizers and one entree between two of us. The food is on the exotic side. This was the first time I'd ever tried bone marrow, head cheese, or foie gras. Loved every dish!!  The tres leches cake for dessert was perfect...not too runny (a problem with many restaurant tres leches cakes I've found). SERVICE: Our service was quick. Since we shared everything, I was impressed with how fast they changed out our plates and silverware. The staff was pleasant, very knowledgeable about the menu and had excellent recommendations.

I've heard raves about this place ever since it opened.  But for someone who has boy-in-the-plastic-bubble food allergies and who's a "When Harry Met Sally" Sally food orderer, a restaurant that changes its menu daily and has a policy of "changes and modifications politely declined," is ridiculous.   But then it was my friend's birthday and I knew Animal served a bacon chocolate bar. So, I figured worse case scenario, I drink champagne. The champagne was excellent... to cleanse between my many courses.  Obviously, this restaurant doesn't need any more good reviews.  It has accumulated an impressive amount of five stars and recognition in the short time it has been open. But I can't help myself.  And this is UNBELIEVABLE coming from me...  They shouldn't make any substitutions or modifications. Their flavors are so perfectly balanced and beautifully textured.  This is art.  Each dish is a composition.  And it should be delivered as the artists intended. Hard for me not to say, "Could I get extra of,  could you hold, could you put on the side..." Sad for me, the bacon chocolate bar had nuts.

Great Edible Adventure! Animal's reputation delivered on the food - most of what we tried, and we ordered quite a few dishes, were excellent.  Standouts were the hamachi tostado & the incredibly smooth and decadent bone marrow.  The pigs ear dish was surprisingly fantastic, if a bit spicy for me to eat a ton of it, I loved the quail egg on top. Disappointed in the decor (or lack of decor), it would have been great to have ANY kind of ambiance or mood and with the food themes they could really get playful and make it fun.  I guess they are going for the minimalist theme, but I just don't get it - it's looks like an unfinished jailcell and doesn't make you want to linger. I would recommend it for those who really like meat and who want to get off the beaten path.  Not sure I would go back now that the novelty has been tried.

Food: very good. We had the baby kale, pig ears, oxtail poutine. The oxtail poutine was FABULOUS - one of the best things I've ever eaten. Atmosphere: boring. No art up, not interesting at all. I like minimalist, but it looked unfinished. Service: our waiter was great, but the food was extremely slow. We got the kale almost immediately, but we then had to wait 45 minutes to get the next dish. Plus, one of the dishes we ordered never made it to us.

Holy crap... I can honestly say this was the best meal I have ever had in my life. I went here for my anniversary back in May. I have wanting to come here since I heard the Two dudes catering guys open up this restaurant but never got a chance to go until now. You do have to make reservation in advance. Two weeks should be fine. They also have a bar for people who did not make a reservation but I saw this one couple wait outside for over 2 hours (the entire time we had our dinner) for a spot to be open. I don't even think there are words to describe the food. We had the follow: Pork Belly sliders - Ugh...melts in your mouth Quail Fry - Everything worked great together Oxtail Poutine - The best fries i think I will ever have LocoMoco - Best.Dish.Ever.Period Pound Cake with Strawberries - Amazing Tres Leches - I would eat all the cake they have if they would let me This place is definitely worth it.

Sweet Jesus, this place is good.   My friend and I decided to try it out one Thursday evening around 9:30.  We were able to get a table quickly and were immediately impressed by some of the selections.  I love my meat (that sounds so dirty)...anyway, love the protein, but to me, the dish is made with the accoutrements.  And being from the deep south, my eyes zeroed in on the quail fry WITH GRITS!  The server tried to sway us a different way, but I was insistent and boy, I'm glad I was.  DELISH! One thing to keep in mind though:  The plates are small.  So maybe think about ordering 3 things between two peeps.  But paradoxically the items are rich.  (Flesh is rich...go figure.)  So just start small and see how things go.  We had the balsamic reduction ribs, rabbit loin and the quail fry, finished with the shortcake (which we shouldn't have ordered because we were more full than we realized but once we tasted the dessert, we couldn't stop).   The bill came to a little under $80 total with a drink a piece and 20% for the server.

Unforgettable restaurant. Unforgettable meal. You're likely to find menu items that you've either never seen before or are so rare you won't find them anywhere else. A+ for creativity. Also, since there's no sign out front, this place gets major kudos for its exclusivity. Though it's right next to Canter's Deli on fairfax -- you're really not likely to stumble in.

It's all about the foie gras biscuit with maple sausage gravy. Ok, that and the hamachi. Exquisite, unique small plates, with great service. Pricey, but the quality of the food is worth living on tuna and hard boiled eggs for the rest of the week. Incredibly rich food, and a nice selection of beer and wine to help vainly thin your blood while gorging. (Unless you are cruel, do NOT take your vegetarian friends. Seriously. You will destroy the relationship.) I will say the desserts didn't blow me away, but then, you should be too full to attempt one anyway.

If nothing else, Animal is "an experience" - something to talk about. We made reservations a few weeks in advance, as there were roughly 10 of us that went. The food was definitely pricey, but you should know that going in. I never thought I'd eat brains... Animal changed that. The veal brains were pretty good, and I'm glad that I'm able to say I tried them. The foie gras was also delicious. We ate "family style" and tried almost everything on the menu, food wise. I think the bill ended up being around $500.

This place has grown on me quite a bit. If you know whats good, you will always leave satisfied. Really love the pig ears with chili and lime, and the buffolo style pigtail - who would have thought! The Indian style sweetbread presentation is really good too. The poutine with oxtail gravy is the best you can get outside Quebec. Stay away from the Foie Gras Loco Moco, it is truly an offensively bad dish.... but many of the dishes on the menu a very solid. Nice wine by the glass too.

this place is great. the food lives up to the reviews on yelp. all the dishes are very rich and filling, so you don't really have to order a ton. i went with my gf and we ordered 4 dishes total to share. they were small-medium in size. i would definitely go back to this place. they say the menu changes daily, which is good because it's a short menu and you can try everything on the menu during 3 visits. out of the 4 dishes, 3 of them were super delish and would order again -- (1) Crunchy Pig Ears with Chili Lime and Fried Egg, (2) BBQ Pork Belly Sandwich (3) Foie Gras Biscuit with Maple Sausage Gravy. the dish that i would not order again: Flat Iron Steak, Sunchoke Hash, Truffle Parmesan Fondue the desserts are overrated, not worth the calories in my opinion. we got the bread pudding. i only ate two bites and left the rest. check out {http://bit.ly/gbe3LM} for a full review.

I probably don't even need to write a review for this place, as a lot of people have covered what I'm about to say, but I'm going to anyway. First off, don't listen to any naysayers about this place. They are either too snooty, or don't appreciate a good meal when they see one (I find that a lot when someone reviews an obviously good restaurant). This is one of those restaurants, and one of my favorite restaurants in L.A. (Providence, and Cafe Beaujolais are right in there too). I had heard really good things about Animal before I went, but still hadn't let it build up too high in my mind. My girlfriend and I went on more of a whim actually, found a seat at the bar luckily, and proceeded to have some of the best food we have ever had (maybe it was because we hadn't expected too much, but I think it's just that good). The bartender/waiter was really helpful, and though it was a busy Saturday night, he took the time to answer our questions and guide us in the right directions for what we wanted. The flavors in the dishes we got complimented each other perfectly, and every dish was cooked perfectly. That night was heaven, and I hope to go back soon and try every other dish on their menu. If you haven't gone yet, go, you won't be disappointed (unless you're a snoot, or don't know anything about what good food tastes like).

I've been to Animal just once with a friend, but plan on going many more times in the future.  For those of you foodies out there who are looking to try all there is to try out in L.A. this is a must-stop-spot.  There is valet parking, but you can also venture onto the side streets nearby in the neighborhood and find parking if it isn't too late in the evening.  One of my favorite things about Animal is the nondescript location and interior.  You could literally walk by and not know there was a restaurant.  The interior is simplistic, yet classic and this place is known for drawing in crowds, so make sure to call at least a day ahead for a reservation!  Their ribs are to die for and literally fall of the bone.  So amazingly decadent.  Don't forget to try the tres leches dessert.  It's an orgasm in your mouth.  Definitely a trendy spot to go to.  Have fun!

Definitely a gem in the LA area. A little bit cumbersome when it comes to making reservations. I played a little bit of phone tag. Server was also so so, he didn't really seem friendly or interested in talking about the food. However, if you just care about the food, it's definitely up there. Got the Hamachi tortilla which was light and fresh. The Pig Ears, which was okay. Had a bit of a kick. But my favorites were the Poutine and Foie Gras loco moco. A loco moco is a Hawaiian dish with rice, spam, eggs and a hamburger patty and if you love that, imagine it with foie gras. It is very rich but delicious. Only hesitancy there is that it's $35 for just that dish--that's the highest I've ever paid for a dish with spam, granted it has foie gras. I still think it's a bit steep, but it's definitely a rich and delicious dish. The Bacon chocolate Crunch bar was ok. I didn't taste the bacon so not sure what was so good about it. it tasted like a typical chocolate dessert to me.

I came here for dinner with a group of 6-8 people, and food was delish. Since it's tapas style though, portions were small for such a large group. Chicken liver, bone marrow, pork belly sliders and foie gras were yummy. I do have a complaint about the reservation service. Their website has really confusing information on "how to make a reservation". I called a handful of times as per the instructed time period listed on the website, but no one picked up so I left 2 voice mails on their system. By the day of the reservation, no one had called me back so I called another few times and finally someone picked up. The hostess claimed to have no record of the messages I left and said "it was weird" that no one responded to my messages. Lesson: when you call to make a reservation, MAKE SURE YOU SPEAK TO A LIVE PERSON as it seems like they don't check their messages.

In a town obsessed with light fare, we indulged in a caloric feast that made me scratch my head and wonder 'how are we not in New York?'  Animal, Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo's Fairfax forty-five seater, has managed to create quite a stir in its first thirteen months.  Certainly, critics of its carne-centric cuisine have surfaced,  but most deem their efforts extraordinary.  Among their fans: Food +Wine, which included the tattooed duo on 2009's short list of Best New Chefs.  Their first restaurant venture, Animal is the sole Los Angeles representative, and deservedly so.  Gail Simmons of F+W was sitting with her girlfriends two tables over, so you know their recommendation is a sincere one! We decided to go tapas-style, as their list of small plates is irresistible.  We began with one of the few vegetarian options, a beautiful Heirloom Tomato Salad with Ginger Vinaigrette and a medley of herbs, including mint and Italian parsley.  This was a lovely prelude to our carnivorous feast.  What followed was a Braised, Deep Fried Pig Ear with Siracha Chili, Lime and a Fried Egg.  As heavy as it sounds, it managed to feel quite light, with a hefty amount of acidity to brighten the dish.   It was, perhaps, the most memorable plate of the evening. Then came the easiest sell of all: lightly fried Sweetbreads over Creamed Spinach with Capers and Hen of the Woods.  I love sweetbreads; spinach is my favorite superfood; salty capers are a go-to place for me in the kitchen; and -  as I've mentioned here before - hen of the woods mushrooms top my fungi list!  I loved the dish.  At first bite, I found the capers to be overwhelming, but when paired with a larger scoop of the creamed spinach, the dish was actually quite balanced. When it came time to choose an entrée, we agreed to split one of the most ludicrous dishes ever conceived: Foie Gras Loco Moco with a Niman Ranch Burger, Spam, Fried Quail Egg over Anson Mills Gold Rice.  To know that someone had committed the culinary sin of placing a perfectly seared piece of foie gras atop a fried sliver of SPAM... I had to experience it first hand!  I'm happy to report that it's a well-conceived riff on a Hawaiian classic.  Let's not pretend for a moment that it hasn't wreaked havoc on my arteries, but the dish has merit besides the sheer novelty of it. Finally, we did ourselves in with their infamous dessert, a house-made Chocolate Crunch Bar rolled in finely chopped Crispy Bacon and Salt and Pepper Anglaise.  David thought they could have challenged our palates with more bacon, but I loved that it nudged the tongue ever so slightly at the end of each bite. I found Shook and Dotolo's menu to be adventurous, unpretentious, and a great value.  Our five plates, and a carafe of Tempranillo brought the tab to just under $100... I would go again in an instant! More at Traveling Tongue http://blog.seanpatrickd…

The menu always changes, but the food is consistently amazing.  From the fried quail to the pork belly sliders to whatever's on the day's menu, you really can't go wrong with anything here. The wine list is fairly small, but it's a knockout.  And why carry 50 wines when the handful that they've got are all this good?  Lots of them I'd never heard of before, but the staff is all very knowledgeable, and will even let you sample a few before you commit.  As for the restaurant itself, it's minimal, but in a good way.  Bare walls and tables in one long room is an oddly effective non-gimmick in a city where tackiness generally reigns. If I have to complain about anything, it's the prices.  I get that all the food is organic and farm-raised, but my pocket still feels pretty lonely at the end of any meal here.  That wine list I was talking about is also pretty much devoid of anything under $15 a glass.  But you can't say the quality isn't there, and overall, I can't say I've ever felt ripped off.  I just wish I could afford to go more often, and when that's the only thing I have to harp on, you know the place must be pretty damn good.  On top of all that, Animal's open til late on the weekends, which makes it the worst (and best) kind of temptation when you're stumbling out of The Dime.  If you're looking for a great locals-only spot with mind-blowing food, and can afford to go to town a bit, look no further: this spot might as well be heaven.

Ate at Animal tonight and LOVED it!! The food was killer! Very creative cuisine, everything we ordered was delicious. Defiantly a place for adventurous eaters. The goat cheese gnocchi was the best I have ever tasted. My only disappointments were that it took quite awhile to be seated, next time I will make sure to have a reservation! Also, the bar tender seemed more interested in flirting with the bimbos next to us at the bar than here did in taking our order. But that said, the staff were all very friendly and once ordered, the food arrived quickly. Do NOT skip dessert at Animal! The strawberry shortcake is heavenly!

I have been to animal about five times and every time I go I end up saying " now that was the best meal I have ever had."  I am a rather picky eater and very much a food snob so it s a rarity to feel comfortable tasting such adventurous sounding fare.   This last time we ordered quite a bit .  First off we had the crispy hominy with lime.  We kept remarking how it was reminiscent of calamari.  So so good, what a great snack I could have eaten all of it by myself.  I had seen this on the menu a few times and shied away because i don't really know that much about hominy, but my boyfriends mom insisted and it was the best! Next we had the beet salad which also was delicious! with pistachios and citrus.  There were quite a few people at our table who did not like beets but everyone enjoyed and thought it really didn't have what they thought of as the earthy off putting beet flavor.  Next the skate wing with favas. Great and a nice lightness and the fish was moist and crispy.   Then the pork belly sliders with mustardy slaw on brioche and then the balsamic ribs, open faced softshell crab sandwich, poutine with oxtail gravy .   The poutine, ribs and sliders are just amazing.  The poutine is like the most decadent chili cheese fries of your life just bordering on the edge of two salty you seriously lap it up.  The ribs are a great counterpoint to the sweet or vinegar based bbq sauce debate.  They really are the best of both worlds and fall of the bone juicy.  Plus even better the recipe is in the two dudes one pan cookbook which I just happened to get signed while I was eating here on Christmas eve with my family. The sliders are what they are known for and everyone thought they were the highlight of the meal. The soft shell crab sandwich is the only slightly negative review.  It was incredibly rich! after all of the fried food and intense sauces, even though we tried to balance with beets and skate, It was decadent and fried and dripping with aoli.  Everyone loved it but I almost couldn't stomach it.  i would suggest ordering wisely. We ended with the tres leches cake it was moist and sweet and nice ending to all the savory that night.  I always have the chocolate crunch bar but this was good too ;).   My final words of wisdom.  Animal is great but you have to be prepared for gluttony sloth and all of the seven deadly sins that are presented here.  it is not the place to have a small salad.  You have to be along for the ride and love wallowing in the rich and decedent once in a while.   They really prepare fish very well and it is something great to mix in to your meal to lighten it up a bit.  if you see the amberjack tuna and nectarines on the menu don't miss it! Just go crazy

Loved it!!!  I would definitely return. For those of you who gave "Animal"  a bad review for serving too much meat.... DUH! The price is very reasonable considering this is L.A..   We ordered Hamachi Toastada, Pork ribs, foie gras, rabbit legs, marrow bones and for dessert the peach/strawberry pie and panna cotta.  I know, it is obscene considering there were only 3 of us. My least favorite was the Hamachi and that was sensational.  You have to try the pork ribs and the marrow bones.  As the friend who took there said, "I recommend everything!".   The desserts were both fantastic, but the pie stood out and that is saying a lot since I don't even like pies.   A must try place...unless you are Vegan.

Pretty solid place. Don't waste time with mains and get appetizers to share. We had: 1. Pork Belly sliders- delicious, don't miss them 2. Octopus- good smoky, meaty flavor, very good 3. Rabbit Loin- tasty and light 4. Bone marrow- delicious and chimichirri sauce was a nice compliment 5. Poutine- not bad but a little too rich (it was the last dish of the night) 6. Foie gras and maple gravy on biscuit- maple gravy was awesome but overpowered the foie gras 7. Melted petit fours cheese dish which was not great 8. Bacon chocolate bar- meh 9. Pie- nice and light end to the meal

A month or more ago I decided I wanted to revisit Animal for my bday dinner. I made a rez for 6 and eagerly awaited my return meal. Yesterday was my bday and I hadn't heard from Animal to confirm my rez. I thought it was strange since most restaurants seem to confirm a few days before. I called to confirm and it seemed they had mistakenly marked it down for the next day. I knew I had booked it specifically for my bday, so I'm pretty confident it was their error. I told them so as nicely as possible. They said they'd see what they could do. They called me back a little while later and said they couldn't fit me in. Bummed I let my party know that dinner was canceled as I didn't feel like dealing with a backup option. Then Animal called back again and said they had a cancellation and they could now fit me in. I let the crew know, but half of them had already made alternate plans, but two of my buddies were still game so we decided to hit it. I didn't let the rez mishap affect my dining experience whatsoever. I was initially annoyed, but chalked it up to an honest mistake. Anyway, I love the food too much at Animal to punish myself by putting any sort of embargo in place. Our meal was wonderful. The three of us split all of the following dishes: - Marrow bone w/ chimichurri - Solid dish, but nothing out of the ordinary. Only came with two slices of toast, but there was enough marrow for three, and I thought they should have included one more. - Pig tails "buffalo style", celery, ranch - I had had this before, and it was worth a repeat. I love the texture of the meat vs. the bone. I dig that you're able to eat most of the bones as well, since they're so fried. My dining companions weren't as keen on eating the bones though. - Veal brains w/ carrots - The brains had been fried a la chicken fried steak. The crispiness made for a nice counterpoint to the gooey brains. Strange, yet delightful. The beefy flavor came thru also to remind me of chicken fried steak. - Thai BBQ quail w/ cabbage-mandarin slaw - Perfect Thai flavorings, presented in a semi-refined way. Loved it. - Grilled octopus w/ chorizo - This was good, but not mindblowing. Octopus was tender. Chorizo was ok. - Balsamic pork ribs - These were tender and good, but not uber flavorful. They were served at the same time as the steak, and they simply lost the flavor match by being served simultaneously. - Flat iron steak w/ truffle Parmesan fondue - The steak was perfectly cooked medium-rare. The fondue was lacquered generously over top, and added a nice creamy-earthiness to the dish. - Bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise - Twas good, but could have used more bacon IMO. The highlights were the pig tail, brains & flat iron. Normally I wouldn't even order a steak at a place like Animal (not that I don't love steak), but it was one of my friend's choice and it ended being quite fantastic. A great meal overall. Was very happy that they were able to find us a table after the initial disappointment. I will be back again.

This is a great new concept, with some wonderful, highly-inventive dishes.  A must try.  While it is all about meat - don't be scared off.  This is a foody paradise.  Delicate flavors, excellent preparation.  Must-tries include the pork belly sliders, bone marrow, rabbit loin spring roll, pig head, pig ear and chocolate bacon crunch bar.  Also a great selection of strong dark beers, including Ten Fidy Imperial Stout and Rouge Double Mocha Porter.  There is no sign out front and the dining room is spartan (part of the marketing), so if you're not careful, you might miss it.

In love!!! We ordered 10 dishes and all were amazing, but the highlights were Pork Belly Sliders, Foei Gras Loco Moco and Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar. They have all the exotic food such as pig tails, veal brains, rabbit sausage, rabbit legs, pig ears, etc. Menu changes daily, place is really small so make sure to get a reservation!! Took photos of all 10 dishes (http://gourmetnglamor.bl…) , and oh all the 4 desserts were great as well!

I absolutely adore animal! their food is unique and tasty!! Things to definitely try: fried pig ears marrow bone sticky toffee pudding i also had their thai quail, liver toast, poutine fries...those were ok... i eat almost everything but didn't particularly enjoy the liver toast but it was super cheap so i had to try it i have been craving fried pig ears and bone marrow ever since i left...i would definitely suggest to make a RESERVATION though because we didn't and waited for almost an hour. The host was friendly though and kept updating us on how long it would take. Overall, it was def worth the wait!

Exquisite food, casual atmosphere, and excellent service. The pork belly sliders with coleslaw was extremely flavorful and tender. The flat iron steak with artichoke and truffle parmesan fondue was moist, tender, and full with flavor. And for dessert, the bacon chocolate with salt and pepper ice cream was sweet, salty, with a hint of spice--a good/interesting blend of flavors. The waiter was extremely attentive, friendly, and provided great service. It's a good place for dates, dinner with friends, and casual dinner. Remember to make reservations beforehand because it is crowded due to its popularity!

I Love this place! I started coming to Animal just few months after it opened and when it was still a place where you can walk in and get a table! It is very diner -ish at first sight, however the food is First Class! the menu changes with the season and the available Organic fruit & Veggies from local Farms. If you go in the summer , try the Tomato Salad, and also if they have the fish sashimi with mandarin - it is light and yummy. I have had the Pork Belly with kimchi - OMG! Also, the Foie Gras - is delicious but also heavy - so I would order and split it with someone ! I have tried every desert and I love the Tres Leches and also i'm a big Panna Cotta fan! Again, none of those are Fat Free so you want a desert? This is the real deal. The people who serve there are very knowlegdeable about the wine pairing with the food you order. I would trust their opinion. Be on time and always book a reservation! I also like to sit at the bar, and have done so as a walk in. I know sometimes you have to wait, but I'll wait 20 minutes for this food... it is worth it! Great wine, great food = Happy Sassy Me :)

Tremendous! We came here because of all the rave reviews which are well deserved.  There were 3 of us self proclaimed professional eaters looking for good food in all nooks and crannies every where we go. We made a reservation 2-3 weeks in advance (which i highly recommend) before we flew to LA. Parking was easy on a Sunday evening. It was in a non descript storefront where we had to do the double take to make sure that we're in the right restaurant. It was quite happening even on a Sunday night  - from big groups to couples. Lone diners could sit at the bar in the back. The decor was clean and minimal; you got a feeling that its all about food here. We did the 'one of each' order approach to share like we often do and there were quite MANY items on the menu. We gave uhhs and aahs to most of the dishes we ordered. The BBQ 'pork belly' sliders (ironically without the fatty belly) provided a great start. The bone marrow was good but it was overwhelmed by too much herbs we thought. It would be nice to taste more of the beefy marrow - i thought Purple Pig in Chicago does one better. My favorite was the quail in a red wine? reduction sauce and the foie gras if you're a big fan like i am. Some we wished we didnt order like the almost burnt broccoli and dried fish salad. The wine selections had mostly French and some German wines. They served in carafes if you didnt want to do bottles. Or you could bring your own; there's a corkage fee of $20 which was quite reasonable here. The desserts were ok -- sticky toffee pudding and assorted berries with yogurt - nothing to write home about. Overall, it was a great fun, cool vibe gastropub experience. I believe they change their menu from time to time. I would definitely come back here again.

I've had the time of my life And I've never felt this way before And I swear this is true And I owe it all to you...at ANIMAL! - Black Eyed Peas (the time) You would never know this place was animal from the outside because there's no signs or anything...and yet its still packed --- which means good word of mouth apparently. I heard about this restaurant from the food and wine festival and as a fan of the top chef show, i had to try this place. First and foremost before i break down the menu that i had in order of them serving it to us in a progression of light to heavy - the flavor of all the dishes we tried here was intense. There is no lack of seasoning in any of their ingredients - that's a definite. Started off with the pig ears with chili, lime, and a fried egg. The pig ears was pretty much bacon bits chopped up and served under a perfectly cooked egg. The chili and lime made the entire dish have a good kick to it, i commented on how it would be a nice dish to start your morning off. Second we had the grilled broccolli with a panchetta viniagrette and it was almost like a salad with paramasean shavings on the sides topped with a round egg. Simple - light - good textures - well thought out dish overall. Third came the bbq pork belly sandwhiches which i would say was probably their most traditional/non-crazy dish out of everything but it was so yum served with a light coleslaw that complimented the pork very nicely. It balanced out the flavors well and was like omg - i could eat a bunch of these things in a meal and be perfectly satisfied. Fourth, we had veal fries which was basically fried veal served with some kind of celery root sauce. I was a bit disappointed with this dish only because the fried texture that covered the veal was so overwhelming that it was hard to taste the veal itself. It was almost as if some of it was burnt and didn't properly cook this thing - i would not order this one again. Fifth came the heaviest/main course of the meal which was the flat iron steak with sunchoke hash and truffle sauce to boot. The steak was cooked medium nice and again, they did a very fine job balancing the flavors of each thing and although all three components were intense - they were intense in a good way that really pushed the dish to the next level. To top it all off - fittingly - was the dulche de leche for dessert. Again, i've never had one of these before and the flavor jumped out at you. It's probably necessary i would say to at least try one of their desserts only because of the intense flavors throughout the meal. This place was worth it fore sure and prices aren't off the wall. Thumbs up for creativity and nice use of intense flavors! Food: 4.5 stars --- Service: 5 stars --- Atmosphere: 4 stars --- Price(value): 4.5 stars

I ate so many things I never dared to order off a menu before... and I liked them all. The food was delicious. My only "however" is that most of the food was very rich. I woke up in the middle of the night with a stomach ache. I think all the animals I ate were having a battle in my belly and I was the loser.

The transcendental sublime. One of the best meals that I've had this past year. Hands down, bar none. Thank you Jon, Vinny, and Animal staff. William, you are one of the best. Had reservations at 9:15. We were promptly seated by the friendly hostess. A few moments later, William, comes to give suggestions, and bring us a bottle of the house Cabernet.   We order: 1. Pork Belly sliders (to die for) 2. Carrot salad. So fresh, it mos def cleansed the palate. 3. Bone marrow with chimichurri 4. Petit Basque with chorizo (I died) 5. Flat iron steak/ truffle parmesan fondue 6. Panna cotta (The best I've had so far) 7. Bacon chocolate bar (I dream of this) This was all shared between two people. Very inexpensive meal for what you get. Very  simple straightforward dining room, no bells and whistles...but with food this provocatively delish, who cares?

As the name suggests, you're coming here to indulge in being a full blown carnivore. No salads to be seen. Such a shame that my stomach wasn't used to consuming such a vast bounty of food, let alone all meat dishes, in one sitting. My cousin and I first ate a chorizo and cheese dip and a foie gras terrine with cherries, both served with buttered toast and both decadently delicious. We also ordered the pork belly sandwich which actually turned out to be two sliders. I'm not a bbq sauce fan but this sauce actually worked and complemented the tender pork belly. Half way through a slider though, I hit my gastronomical wall. The last dish that came was the poutine with oxtail..which was awesome but at that point I was only able to fit 4 fries. That being said, my half pork belly slider and leftover poutine were still pretty good the day after.

I love meat. All kinds of meat. Meat is fabulous. And even though I understand that eating copious amounts probably isn't good for my health, I have come to terms with the fact that it will always be a significant part of my diet as I tend to suffer withdrawal symptoms when I go too long without it. I gave up eating meat for Lent one year and had nightmares every night that I was being chased by a very bloody rib-eye steak screaming, "Eat me!" over and over again. By day 38 of the 40 days I succumbed to my craving and ripped into an entire rotisserie chicken. Obviously vegetarianism is not for me although I do admire those who can make it their lifestyle. Animal's name alone was intriguing to me. It indicated something carnal and basic... and absolutely delicious. The phrases "meat-centric cooking" and "Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar" did me in completely and I've had it bookmarked since its opening. I've been dying to go and when we ended up here on a Saturday night I was bubbling with excitement. It definitely helped that we were with a group of friends who love to eat just as much as we do because we were ready to get down. We started off with melted Petit Basque cheese atop Fra' Mani Chorizo served with Grilled Garlic Toast. Melted cheese+ sausage +bread. Is there really any better combination? We attacked the dish with gusto requesting extra bread ($2 extra) to make sure we got every bit of melty goodness. The Pork Ribs with Balsamic had been cooked for 10 hours and came to the table falling off the bone tender. Served aside it was a salad of Roasted Delicata Squash, Rocket, and Pecans. The dish was good for what it was but because I'm not too big on sweet meat, it wasn't my favorite. My favorite was the huge slab of Pork Belly with Kimchi, Peanuts, Chili, and Soy. Good Lord was that GOOD. Meaty, salty, crunchy, and spicy. I could have had that for my main course AND dessert. The Veal Sweetbread Schnitzel was crisp on the outside and juicy tender inside. It comes with mashed potatoes and pickled red cabbage but my suggestion is to eat the nuggets alone without any condiments, that way you can enjoy the dainty flavor of the sweetbread. I know their Foi Gras with Maple Sausage Gravy and Biscuit is a signature dish and I have to admit the size of the foi gras is very generous in relation to the price ($22). However, the gravy was very rich and took away from the airy cloud-like texture of the foi gras and it become a bit muddled. The Raw Amberjack with Cucumber, Mint Yogurt, Pomegranate, Orange and Apple was fresh, clean, and lovely. Probably my second favorite appetizer. Since all of us in our group were having a hard time deciding on main courses we decided to each order a different dish and share. This proved to be a good plan since we liked some dishes much more than others and it gave us a chance to sample most everything on the menu. The Turbot with King crab, Tabasco butter, Gold Rice Succotash, and Cippolini had to be my favorite. The fish was tender, the crab plentiful, and the succotash and onions did well with the buttery sauce. The Flat Iron Steak with Sunchokes, Lobster & Chanterelle Mushrooms and Hotel Butter was charred nicely but tasted tough and I didn't care for the sunchokes.  The Grilled Pork Chop, Braised Cabbage, Apple, Carrot, and Mustard Vinaigrette was standard and a bit dry in my opinion. The Whole Grilled Branzino with Arugula, Romano Beans and Pancetta Vinaigrette was lighter fare as it was the one dish on the menu not cooked in butter but tasted a bit salty. But the Quail Fry... My oh my... Served with Grits, Maple Jus, Long Cooked Chard, and Slab Bacon it is the kind of dish that makes you want to cry a little just because it's so good. So. Good. The desserts were a bit disappointing. The Bacon Chocolate Crunch Bar with Salt and Pepper Anglaise was fun but nothing special. Mixing bacon and chocolate is fairly common nowadays so even though I was looking forward to it, I wasn't too wowed. The Blueberry & Peach Upside Down Cake with Whipped Cream was fantastic though- warm with crisp edges, it was the perfect rustic dessert. The Bellwether Ricotta with Honey and Fruit Nut Bread was one dish we all wished we hadn't ordered. The ricotta was cold and grainy and didn't taste good with the bread. Don't order this if you go. The 4 stars for the review is based on the food, service, and general experience. Some dishes worked really well and some not so much but overall this was one of the more fun nights out in recent memory. The service was attentive, parking was easy to find, and good times were had by all. Good times indeed.

Disclaimer: I'm vegetarian-ish. Not extremely strict about it and I love me a burger. However, just animal is a bit much for me. Tried the bone marrow and loco moco but my favorite thing was the tomato thing. And we tried to order another salad but they were all out. Too heavy for me. But I do like the concept, and if someone wanted to go I would probably go again to humor them. But not something I would suggest on my own if we were trying to figure out where to eat. And it gets insanely crowded. Make reservations. We waited for close to an hour once. And go earlier in the evening bc they have a bad habit of running out of the exact thing that u want to order.

I've never felt like such a carnivore in all of my life (*A note to all of my vegan, veggie friends...You might want to stop reading this review right about now*) On the recommendation of a very reliable source (please see the 'First Bite' section in this week's LA Weekly) I made a reservation at Animal for me and the lovely Ms. Stephy S. I mean when Yelp royalty is in town you must make dinner plan accordingly, right? Well, it had been a while since I last make a trek up that stretch of Fairfax between Beverly and Melrose, and damn, there is a lot going on over there in dem dare parts. Largo has moved, and Animal has moved in. Turntable, Canters, Out of the Closet and the rest still stand proudly. After scoring a rad parking space right out front (yay for good parking karma!) we stepped in to discover a dimly lit restaurant with minimal clutter that had a serious New York City eatery vibe. Animal has great exposed wooden tables, nicely polished floors and a small bar that serves beer and wine by the glass, half carafe and the bottle. There was a pretty good selection of wines, and one of our very attentive waiters helped us find a bold red that paired nicely with the carnivorous feast we were about to partake in. I have to say that at first taste I was unimpressed with the wine selection, however when the food came, all was well with the world. We ordered the pork ribs to start, because with all of this BBQ talk happening on the site, BBQ is constantly on my dome piece. The marinade was really taste, with a good amount of spice, and the ribs were served with pickled vegetables, one of my favorite things in the world! Overall I was happy with the ribs, except for the fact that a few were served cold. That's OK, it's a new restaurant so there is no love lost there. For our main course we ordered the bone-in rib-eye for two. I have to admit I am not much of a red meat eater, I'll order seafood every time if I am given the choice, however I'm at Animal....MUST EAT MEAT. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and served with a side of fluffy mashed potatoes, and the fois gras sauce they poured over the meat was divine. Yea, I said "divine". At first glance, the steak looked like more than even the two of us could devour, but we put a pretty big dent in it, for two svelte ladies, such as ourselves. Hahaha...I couldn't even type that one without laughing. Overall, my experience at Animal was a good one. A great reminder that LA continues to pump out quality eateries on par with that of New York and San Francisco. Way to make this city proud, Food Dudes!

When I moved to Kansas from California in 5th grade, my whole world changed (cue Aladdin song). It was in Kansas where the proverbial "shit hit the f*n". My grades dropped because the curriculum was strangely different (missions? you mean trails, right?)... My nose bled all the time due to the climate change ~shiver~... I went from being Asian to white in 60 seconds... I figured out how to TP with finesse... I experienced/hated snow... I saw/hated cows... But most importantly, that first year of my new vanilla life in Kansas began a life-long battle against my slowly developing ravenous appetite for greasy MEAT. And not just meat, but any food that is meant to clog your arteries. To this day, I conveniently fail to mention to you lean, judgy Californians exactly how many times I've eaten KC Masterpiece barbecue ribs in my life or had to use a paper towel to pat my food dry or had the opportunity to just about pick the cow I was going to eat. Well, when I moved back to California for college and beyond, the hard habit never died. And good thing because that hard habit has found a new home at...wait for it...Animal. Oh Animal, with your heart attack-inducing pork belly delights, and cruelly obtained chicken liver and force-fed foie gras, and your lovely lovely lovely SPAM. I hate you, but I love you. I figure, if we're gonna eat the animals, might as well do it in the most disgustingly human (no "e" here) way possible. I'm not sure how much change the menu undergoes from day to day, but for 8/22/09, my two amigas and I really did go all out, leading to only one horrible vomitous ending later in the night (seriously, no kidding). The meal for the night: 2 chicken liver toasts; 1 white prosciutto (yeah, white meaning only fat) on a crostini; 1 arugula, apple, grapes, pine nuts, white balsamic, parmesan salad (yep, something healthy); 1 pork belly, kimchi, peanuts, chili soy, scallion dish; 1 poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar dish; 1 foie gras loco moco with quail egg, spam and hamburger dish; 1 tres leches with dulce de leche; 1 bacon chocolate crunch bar with s&p anglaise; and all washed down with a couple of proseccos and a glass of water. Yes, there were only 3 of us, and yes, we were going to get the sweetbreads, creamed spinach, capers, hen of the woods dish if we weren't informed that "the chef isn't happy with it and will not be putting it out for the night." My highlights were the distinctly aged cheddar on the poutine, the cruelly obtained and smooth foie gras on the loco moco, the tenderness of the pork belly, and the total awesomeness of the rich dulce de leche in the tres leches. My lowlight was definitely the bacon chocolate crunch bar--eek!--that is, unless it's supposed to taste like burnt charcoal--then I stand corrected. Aaah, less reviewing, more eating. Don't worry Animal, I will be back....with my Kansas appetite...and my heart monitor...and my money...and my YUM!! Shout out: Felicia C. because it was her review that let me know this place existed and made me wanna come here.

I've been waiting to come here for a long time. And sadly, I was underwhelmed. There were some amazing dishes: chicken liver toast (and I do not like pate), foie gras with biscuit and maple gravy. But I ate more lackluster dishes than amazing ones. Service was great, ambience was excellent.

What's in a name? With a name like "Animal", you know you're in for a carnivorous feast. That intrigued even the least meat fancying gal like yours truely. Can this restaurant really change my views on meat? I was beaming with excitement to find out. None of the entrees interested us that much since I'm more of a small plates type of gal so we ordered the pork sliders, quail fry, foie grais biscuit, and oxtail poutine along with some cheap house wine to accompany all the rich & savory dishes. OOOMMMMGGG! I did the happy dance after biting into the sweet pork belly sliders, the foie gras maple biscuits made my tongue cry out in glee, and I swear the quail fry was fried with crack because it was addictingly amazing! Then came the debbie downer.... the oxtail poutine was almost swimming in oxtail stew and was way too salty. That was also the last and largest dish of the night which caused us a huge struggle to finish. We almost decided not to get dessert because we were too full but I'm glad we did because the delightful strawberry pound cake redeemed the meal for me and I left with a grin on my face. I'd definitely return but word of caution to all - stay away from the poutine!

We were very disappointed in both the food and the service.  Our reservations were at 6:45.  The restaurant was full but not crazy.  The waiter was unattentive.  We sat for more than 10 minutes before he acknowledge we were there.  No hello no welcome, no here are our specials.  Just what would you like?  Was it because we had a kid?  I saw children at other tables, and they seemed to get good service.  The busboy was more attentive to us than the waiter.  So I watched the rest of the evening at the service.  Two attractive ladies sat next to us.  They got the full welcome mat  including the specials. Foodwise - The first course salad was great.  Second course foie gras with marinated pears.  The pears overwelmed the foie gras.  The third course, petit basque looked like pepperoni with cheese on top, and my toast was burnt black.  I couldn't send it back because I never saw the waiter.  Finally the pork belly sliders.  They were good but lacked anything special or original.  Momofuku made the pork belly famous, do something different!! I was really hoping you would be the next Fatty Crab or Blue Ribbon of NYC, or Range of SF.  Instead I get ok food and bad service. Advice to owner- promote the busboy, and fire the waiter!!

I could barely contain my excitement.  Finally, Animal, you will be mine!  Ultra minimalist, clean, freshly painted walls free of paintings or other bric-a-brac with a small bar residing in the back, Animal was decorated with the following motto in mind:  This place is about the food.  In a city fraught with places that are often about everything but, I'll say "amen" to that. We started off with two apps--the foie gras biscuits with maple sausage gravy and the quail fry over grits, two slabs of bacon, chard, and maple jus.  The quail arrived first--four portions deep fried, looking vaguely like Popeye's (hey, I love Popeye's!).  My friend took the first bite and she confidently stated, "It's good."  She took another bite and declared, "I mean, realllllly good."  A clear blue appreciator of the finer things in life, girlfriend was right. on.  Just scrumptious, lightly crispy skin and tender meat, penetrated with juices, the flavoring was delicate with a hair-trigger of smoky hickory from the bacon.  And don't think for a minute, I didn't eat the accompanying slabs of bacon.  Yum yum.  The foie gras was another winner.  A triumphant pyramid of foie gras atop biscuit in a moat of thick sausage gravy, one bite had me tongue-tied and uttering gobbledygook.  Nyam nyam nyam, a perfect biscuit--not cold and just sittin' there like a rock as biscuits often do--provided a little bit of a crisp texture to go with the soft foie gras.  The seasoning of this dish was terrifically on point with a lingering note of pepper stemming from the sausage gravy. For our two mains, we decided on the flat-iron steak and turbot with king crab.  The flat-iron was a bit more medium than medium-rare, but this dish was more about those singing sides.  Mushrooms!  Delicious chantarelles and a rich truffle parmesan fondue.  Very nice.  The asparagus also had just the right amount of crunch.  The turbot sat on a bed of sweet corn, rice, and a spiced butter reduction.  Every kernel of corn had a little bit of kick.  Nice trick.  The turbot, on the other hand, was a little bit on the salty side.  The king crab pulled apart with ease.  Solid dish, but I wouldn't order it again. At this point, we were getting full, so we just had room for one dessert, and opted for the signature bacon chocolate crunch bar.  It was akin to a nice fudge brownie with a barely there (as in, you need to search and search... and search) nip of saltiness from what I assume are the bacon bits.  They give the chocolate a KitKat bit of crunch, which is hardly a novelty.  Whatever, I made sure every crumb was digested and properly appreciated.  Probably wouldn't order this again, either. Service was very good with human smiles.  Our waiter gave me suggestions to think about prior to ordering and water was replenished on cue.  There is valet ($5, I think), but parallel parking shouldn't be too hard, as this part of town is low-key.  Again, this is a small restaurant tucked at an obscure location on Fairfax with zero signage.  Clearly, to confuse trend-seeking idiots and keep the place on the DL; I quote the hostess on the latter point.  With a menu that presumably changes daily, this place is about food, quality ingredients, arteries-sighing calories, and it 'ain't named Animal just to invoke bestial passions.  I found ONE appetizer comprised of beets, kalamata olives, and feta.  Translation:  If you're a vegetarian (or vegan!!), you're slightly dim-witted (definitely dim if you're vegan) for coming to a place called Animal, get the hell outty 'cause parts of you might end up stir-fried, marinated, and de-boned.  Seriously, pig ear came highly recommended from our waiter.  Would initiate the uninitiated, but definitely come hungry.  The food is filling.

So i may have been overhyped about this restaurant (one of my friends insists that this is the best place hes ever eaten), but I was a little disappointed. It wasn't that anything we ordered wasn't good, but there are a lot of restaurants that I think offer better tasting (albeit not as interesting) food at a better price. Our table ordered the kale, sweetbreads, buffalo pigtails, balsamic glazed ribs, poutine, chicken liver toast, tres leches, and bacon crunch bar. the kale, chicken liver toast, poutine, and ribs were tasty and satisfying. My favorite was the oxtail gravy on top of the poutine. The sweetbreads and buffalo pigtails didn't taste bad at all, but other than the fact that I'm eating food I can't ordinarily find, I don't see any reason to order these entrees again. the bacon crunch bar was good, i really liked the way the saltiness of the bacon played off of the chocolate. the tres leches was half good. the outsides were well soaked in deliciousness (condensed milk) but the cake got kinda dry (unacceptable) in the middle area. The service wasn't great, and the food took a little too long to get to our table, but this wasn't included in my star rating. Another yelper mentioned that she loves going to places where the waiters are excited about the food. I totally agree, but this just wasn't my experience at Animal. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad place to eat at all. If you really like trying interesting types of meat ordinarily not found on the menu, this may be the place for you. I generally eat those things anyways, so I guess I was hoping for something more. Something I unfortunately didn't find at Animal.

dropped into animal this weekend for the 2nd time and found it to be a bit lackluster compared to my first outing earlier in the year. service was good but the food was meh to ok all around. - chicken liver toast: nice and creamy but the liver was a bit bitter. - uni w/ cucumber: this was a total rip off and was bleh.  two pieces of uni with sliced cucumber and salt on top for $19. wow. - poutine: this was super salty.  gotta eat it fast or the fries will get super mushy. - marrow bone: this was ok. for some reason, every marrow bone that i have can't live up to the one i had at the gorbals. - pig ear: this dish was hyped up but i found it to be meh. the pig ears could have used a little more time in the fryer as it was super crispy.  the chili lime sauce was very acidic but since the pig ears are not super rich, the high acidity detracted from the dish. - quail fry: this was very greasy.....would you like a side of quail with the oil sir?. - sweetbreads: this was good. the sweetbreads were nicely fried and the interior was very soft and tender.  the creamed spinach and mushrooms helped pull the dish together - veal brain: this was also good. soft like a marshmallow and pan seared.  the accompanying sauce was very good. - foie gras biscuit: this was my favorite dish the first time i went to animal but i found it to be just ok on this trip.   i think the liberal use of the sauce muffled the taste and texture of the foie and biscuit - foie w/ marshmallows: this was interesting.  the foie was nicely seared and i'm still trying to figure out if i liked the foie/marshmallow pairing. all in all, dinner was fun due to the company but the food was just ok with a couple being good..  perhaps i was expecting more from my 2nd outing?  i dunno.

For my 300th review, I would like to start off with lyrics from a song: "beautiful girls all over the world i could be chasing but my time would be wasted they got nothing on you baby nothing on you baby they might say hi and i might say hey but you shouldn't worry about what they say cos they got nothing on you baby nothing on you baby" The way I feel about Animal may not be as extreme as those lyrics but I truly enjoyed my recent dining experience here. The place can easily be missed. No loud or noticeable signs. You just have to know that you're at the right spot. I was doubting myself before I walked in. I didn't want to make a fool out of myself by being at the wrong spot and claiming I had reservations. Speaking of which, if you can, make reservations. The place is small and doesn't easily accomodate huge groups. And if you do call to reserve a table, call early in the day. DO NOT CALL after 5-6, they get pretty busy and it's really loud. My friend and I looked over the menu (which changes daily) and we came to the conclusion that the main dishes didn't look convincing enough as their appetizers. We ended up ordering 4 apps total for the night and I'm glad we did because we didn't want to roll out of the joint feeling like the Michelin Man. My personal ranking order: 1. BBQ pork belly sanwiches with slaw. Fatty, juicy, petite yet very satisfying. An order includes two of these. Bread was real soft. You didn't want to chomp on it as if it was a Carl's $6 burger, but rather savor every bite. Maybe toothpicks would help keep the sandwich in place. 2. Baby broccoli, pancetta, parmesan, soft egg, bread crumbs. Yes, this veggie dish is how you would say, "money." The baby broccoli just disintegrates in your mouth with ease. The awesome pancetta w/ parmesan plays an integral role by complimenting the greens, giving this dish character. Warning to those who do not like runny eggs, that is what you get here. 3. Duck confit, apple, pecans, dates, arugula. I'm a sucker for this dish so I might be bias. Although the duck was a little bit salty, all the other ingredients help balanced it out. The chemistry of all the items would have made Einstein smirk. 4. Melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread. My friend was sold but I didn't think it was that noteworthy. Very rich, super cheesy and oily. Grilled bread was probably the best part. Of course, my friend wanted to conclude the meal with the bacon chocolate crunch bar for dessert. It was an interesting mix, you can really taste the bacon within the dark chocolate. You get two crunchy little sticks. Perhaps popular with the ladies but I was more curious about Joe's doughnuts with cinnamon sugar & caramel. Our server, "J" (for short) was a cool dude. Very friendly and informative. At times, it seemed like our food took some time to come out but when it finally arrived, it was all smiles. They never let our water glasses go low either. I'll be back Animal, thanks for the memorable first impressions. You ain't a cheap date, that's fo sho. Our follow up date will come soon "shorty."

WOW, HAPPY AUGUST! dinner last night was at ... ANIMAL ... 3.75. IF ANYTHING, GET THE FOIE GRAS -- photo uploaded.. continue reading~!! not a place where you could totally stuff your fat face, animal style, and i was hoping i could, because i WAS in LA ... located the north side of beverly & fairfax, a door or two down from the infamous jewish deli, CANTERS ... animal ... doesn't have a menu online since they change their menus daily ...  but nonetheless. the place itself, is super clean, not extremely spacious, just to hold about 60-70 heads or so, so a bit cozy, with a teeny bar in the back ... can get a bit loud, but nice enough to NOT bump your elbows with your fellow neigbhors. i wasn't really fond of their edison light bulbs, and the extra lights on top, near the ceilings ...  long hallway towards the restroom ... took a peek in the kitchen, had only 2-3 guys working in there, 2 servers, 1 hostess ... so you do the math ... we got there around 8ish, and the lights were TOO bright on the eyes, but it slowly made itself romantic, or you don't say around, 10ish, which i think was a minus ... having a candle in the middle of the wooden tables would possibly have been a nice touch ... or perhaps having some sorta comfy cushion on the wooden booths... just something to think about, animal...lol FOOD! -rather salty and too rich for me, but the prices are REASONABLE -- which is where I HEART LA ... in fact, i even came with a renowned chef, who's pretty well known -- names can not be released due to confideniality purposes so i KNOW that my taste buds weren't exactly schizo ... :))) and we were eye to eye on the food ... the menu has a fine selection to choose from ... with such fine ingredients, and they even support their local and organic farming, when possible.. there were more starters than entrees, so we chose 3 starters and shared an entree... -pork belly with kimchi and chili soy $9 (super drenched with the sauce, making it so sour. kimchi wasn't exactly the local, authentic taste.. remember, i AM KOREAN...) -melted petite basque with framani chorizo, and garlic bread $9... again, too strong, and salty.. if the cheese was a bit more milder, perhaps the chorizo would have been delish, or the other way around, perhaps a lil more veggies inside? ... but it was sooo good ... -FOIE GRAS, with hosue sausage gravy $22. $22... O M G... $ 2 2 for that HUGE PIECE OF FOIE GRAS...  mebe i should give it one more star for that... okay, i will .. when i intially started it off with a 3-star. this sucker was to DIE FOR.... if anything, i'd have gotten 2 if i could, but there's only so much you could to eat ... :))))) WOW !!! WOW, WOW!!! WOW, WOW, WOOOOOWWW!!! major kudos to FOIE GRAS.. :-))) now, the entree, we shared their signature quail fry with grits and greens with few slabs of UNCOOKED bacon... hm. -.25  for $23, it was OKAY ...a bit burnt and TOO salty again ... overall, this place is fairly new, so it has a lot of potential, IMHO, not that my points really matter, but remember, THIS IS MY YELP BOX where i can write as freely as possible, remember, it DOES say that in the 1st Amendment. lol. didn't care much for dessert, so off we went. forgot what wine we got, but nice to know that they offer it in 3 ways- glass, carafe, and bottle. service - no complaints. attentive.. 18% gratiity added to parties of 6 or more and $20 corkage fee. there is valet of course, and because of canters, meter parking can get a bit sketchy, but we scored a spot right in front... WOOHOO. yea, i'll come back...

Probably 3.75 stars, but I'm rounding up for service and the inventiveness of many of the dishes.  Sadly, I was not blown away. I was so excited to come to Animal.  It's been on my list forever!  So here's the deal: Pig Ear: Yum!!!  Thin, crispy strips of ear (I never thought I'd write that!) with a well-flavored chili/lime sauce, covered with a fried egg.  The combination of flavors and textures was great! BBQ Pork Belly Sliders:  Jim G. did not want to order these, as he is over the whole slider thing.  However, James, our server, insisted.  So glad he did!  The crispy/fatty combination of the pork belly, topped with the tasty bbq sauce and the subtle slaw was a knockout!  Yummy! All along, we're enjoying these dishes with a bottle of Saumur (mostly cab franc with a blend of cab, recommended by our server) and some Racer 5 IPA for Jim G.  Sadly, for me, things go a bit downhill here. Poutine: Fries topped with cheese and oxtail stew.  I was excited to taste this, but only had a few bites.  The fries weren't all that crispy as people claim, and the oxtail stew tasted too greasy for me.   Not worth the calories. Foie Gras Loco Moco: One of the reasons I came here!  I was disappointed.  The Quail Egg was overdone, so no yummy yolk to mix everything together.  The Foie Gras wasn't bad, but was somehow overpowered by the mediocre hamburger patty and the spam.  The textures weren't interesting and the flavors were bland.  That is, of course, until you get to the bottom, where there was a nice combination of teriyaki sauce and sriracha.  That I liked, but the flavors didn't really work well together.  And, for 35 bucks, no way! Chocolate Bacon Crunch Bar: The other reason I came here!  Not bad, for sure, but not impressive.  WIth a more flavorful/warm/maybe even dark chocolate, the bar would work much better.  The dish tasted fatty too; not fatty as in there's fat in the dish (duh, it's dessert!) but fatty as in lard-y or congealed fat. Not ideal when mixed with chocolate.  I expected more. Bottom line: I greatly enjoyed some of the meal and had a nice evening (good service, etc.) but I wouldn't go back anytime soon, so that's my gauge.

Took a trip into the BIG CITY (LA) the other night to take the brother out for his birthday. Decided this is a good time to try Animal. Had a 7:30pm reservation and was seated immediately. Really nice hostess, very friendly. Next  the waiter, he was pleasant, informative, and really attentive. This place is starting to grow on me. Our party consisted of seven people, so we ordered almost every appetizer on the menu. They were all really good, some stand outs were, lamb chops, roasted squid, foie gras on a biscuit, beet salad, arugula salad, pork belly in kimchee, and more. Everyone was wonderful, filled with flavors that worked together. For the main course they only have 5 entrees so we ordered all of them, delicious. The fried quail, great, the flat iron steak in truffle oil great, the sole wonderful and lite, a whole slab of pork ribs, OK. Loco moco great. We all were happy campers, I even saw sparks flying off the cutlery, my family had their groove on, didn't want to get in the way of those forks and knifes. The final course in our gastronomic adventure the desserts.Started with the tres leche cake, chocolate bacon crunch bar, and apricot tart warm. I barely had gotten my fork off the table and they disappeared. Must of been delicious. Maybe next time I'll get a taste. My only complaint would be the noise level, it was crowded and very noisy. The ceilings are high and the floors are concrete. It was difficult to really talk at a normal level. They did try and add some sound proofing high on the walls,  but it was inadequate. So in summary the service and  food were  excellent. I truly enjoyed everything and so did the rest of the party. So I let the noise level slid,. perfection is overated anyway.

IMO 5 stars for sure. All the ingredients worked perfectly together.  Not one ingredient overpowers another, but melds together to give your palate a wonderful experience.  The portion size spot on for sharing, 4-7 dishes is perfect depending on if you get dessert, although you can splurge and get one of each. Order as follows marrow of bone with chimichurri sauce and caramelized onions with toast -fatty richness of the marrow, the cut from the acid in the chimichurri, the sweetness from the caramelized onions to the crusty toast make it all worth it. bbq pork belly slider with cole slaw -fluffy slider sized brioche bun with some a very slight tug, perfect sized pork belly with good seasoning and obviously fatty goodness, texture from the crunchy cole slaw.  the combo is great just enough pork belly to make it not feel heavy.  nice sweet and a little bit smokey bbq sauce.  two serving of this, poutine with ox tail gravy and white cheddar, and a beer and i'm set poutine with ox tail gravy and white cheddar shavings -awesome fry, well maybe on the verge of too well done, but i like it like that; keeps it crispy with the applied gravy.  awesome ox tail gravy, ox tail being one of my favorite things to eat, akin to brisket that looks like shredded beef.  deep flavor in the brown oxtail gravy with shredded ox tail, just enough saltiness from the cheddar.  i really dig the sharpness you get from the white cheddar. foie gras loco moco, quail egg, spam, hamburger -the base seemed like broken rice although i couldn't tell for sure.  the foie gras was perfectly seared and just melts in your mouth,  the spam was pan fried giving it that nice crust that elevates the dish, the homemade hamburger patty was a nice touch.  topped with the quail egg, i only wish there were two quail eggs, as i extremely enjoy how the yolk oozes all over everything.  dashes of saraicha around the plate to spice things up with a base of what i would say is a sweet soy concoction and sprinkled with some chopped green onion/scallions.    it works extremely well. bacon chocolate crunch bar with s&p anglaise -good, but not the best thing bacon i've ever eaten ala Duff from food network.  the best thing bacon i've ear eaten, would be a stack of crispy bacon by itself, perhaps maple syrup to dip it in?  anyway.  the crispy bacon gave the chocolate bar some good contrast with the smooth chocolate terrine, the s&p anglaise imo did nothing to enhance. tres leche cake -it was pretty good, dense, and drenched with the three milks it's made with, good rich frosting covering the top.  my verdict?  too damn sweet.  i much prefer protos tres leche cake with fresh fruit. wine and beer we had was meh. to sum it up, i ordered 4 dishes, i licked 2 of them on purpose.  was it that good?  yes, that good.

I really enjoyed the food at Animal.  I didn't have any expectations going in, but I found most everything to be delectable.  We ordered: -Chicken Liver Toast ($3) - I really do not like the taste of chicken liver, but the bits of balsamic onions on it were soooo good.  It made the chicken liver palatable.  My friend really liked this inexpensive appetizer, and I'm sure if I liked the taste of chicken liver, I would have loved this. -BBQ Pork Belly Sandwiches ($12) - I wasn't expecting much, but I definitely enjoyed these.  The BBQ was sweet and slightly tangy. -Poutine w/ Oxtail Gravy ($15) - OMG this was way too heavy.  I think we maybe finished half (or less) of this.  I wasn't a fan of this dish and found it to be a bit bland.  Also, the fries were not shoestring. -Foie Gras, Maple Sausage Gravy, and Biscuit ($23) - I am now a big fan of fried Foie Gras.  This came with a nice serving of it along with an interesting mix of gravy and maple syrup.  It reminded me of breakfast - a very rich and fatty one.  The Foie Gras was really soft, though the Foie Gras from Ludobites 5.0 really melted like butter in my mouth.  Still, this was a great dish. -Pig Ears, Chili, Lime, Fried Egg ($12) - This is the American version of Sisig, a Filipino pork dish.  I think this was my favorite dish, though it was a tiny bit spicy.  Don't miss out on this one! -Sticky Toffee Pudding ($7) -  This was a dense Sticky Toffee Pudding - it wasn't my favorite.  Cut in two small rectangles, it was really too dense.  It was also flavored with orange, a pairing I didn't particularly like (though in general, I do like orange).  Usually dessert is my favorite part of the meal, but I have to say that this was not. This was more than enough food for two people.  In fact, I think the Poutine really put my friend over the edge.  Service was good and we were seated promptly for our reservation at 7 on a Sunday.  I try not to eat too much meat, but the people at Animal cook it really well!  Can't wait to come back!  The bill came out to a bit under $100 w/ tip and tax for two.  Not bad for a very good meal!

i had been lusting after animal for a while, and when i finally had the occasion to dine there, it did not disappoint in all its rich, carnivorous glory. my friend encouraged me to try the pig ear, and i'm glad i did. i had expected something cartilagey and hard to chew, but it was actually surprisingly crispy and easy to eat. we also started with the fluke with grape and yuzu granita, and it was nice and light, in contrast to the dishes to come. my favorite dish was a tie between the BBQ pork belly sliders and the foie gras loco moco. both were amazingly, astoundingly good and are must tries when you go to animal. i thought the poutine was going to be my favorite, considering my love for the canadian delicacy, but it was just okay. initially it came out oversalted, but the manager quickly and graciously rectified the problem. apparently they had been a little heavy handed in salting the fries. we ended the meal with joe's doughnuts, which came with a delectable caramel sauce. they were fluffy and pillowy, but i hesitate to proclaim them life-changing or the best i've ever had. street parking was easy to find on a monday evening, but they do have valet, which also makes it easier to spot the restaurant even though it is sans sign.

Hello, my name is Gino G and I, uh... I eat tiny birds. I see them on menus and I order them, await their arrival, then strip their tender muscles from their fragile little bones. I feel a tinge of remorse, so I order a beer beforehand which blurs the emotion from darkness to giddiness. Few places cater to my kind and Animal does so unapologetically with their "Quail Fry". Keeping my small birds company on the plate, Animal includes thick slices of bacon (from piglets, no doubt) resting on creamy grits, au jus, and spinach. I'm a bad person, and if you know how to treat yourself, so are you.

wow.......... this food is ambrosia... came here with my supah fly yelper Oanh N. and we went to fucking town.  i really feel blessed to have come, i've heard about it for awhile but never actually took the time to venture out of my Venice bubble. we had: the Foie Gras on a hamburger pattie, topped with quail egg on a bed of spicy rice.  Foie Gras has a really strong flavor, so it has to be done right or it can be too much.  paired with a juicy burger patty was the right way to undercut the strong flavor and i found myself stealing part of my lovely lady friend's portion! HAW! sweet breads....ahh sweet breads!@# my favorite... just so you know they're GLANDS, skillet fried w capers and grapefruit. pork belly sliders....no one on yelp seems to like fatty pork belly but me..and Oanh (our shared love of pork fat is unsurpassed on yelp). Topped with cole slaw on a homemade crispy croissant! shit.....mang.....? ox-tail poutine.  good! wouldn't order it again, but it's one of the most filling items on the menu. i've had canadian poutine before and i didn't think this was as good... ("that's what SHE said" WHAAAATTT???) for dessert: chocolate bar topped with BACON.  such a carnivorous restaurant, this one. my vegan friends would be appalled as would my doctor at my cholesterol spike after this rich meal. they don't serve ice in their glasses which is a pain in my ass and my only gripe. heaven.

HMMMMMMMMMMM...this one really made me think! 3 appetizers for a girl and a boy. We were both full. However being as this was our first time, we ordered 3 appetizers, 2 entrees, and a dessert. 1. Pig ear - Taiwanese delicacy? Definitely different due to the spiciness. It was crunchy versus the usual smooth texture at the local chinese place. You should try it. 2. BBQ pork sliders - My FAVORITE out of everything we ordered. FREAKING melts in your mouth. You're only chewing because of the bread. ;) 3. Poutine w/oxtail gravy - Weird combo with the fries, cheddar, and oxtail. I don't really prefer this one even though it was highly recommended. 4. Monkfish - First taste reminded me of long john silver, and then right after was a tang of salt. I did like the grainy mustard as the dressing. Other than that, I only took a bite. 5. Ribs - It was overwhelming powerful because I almost choked every time I put a slab of meat in my mouth. I think it was an overload of cumin, but I believe that's on purpose. Nothing too spectacular for me. The sweet yams seemed like they were mixed with marshmallows and had a pool of butter on top. Nothing special either. 6. Tres leches - Got this at Fogo de Chao and absolutely craved it the next day. However, I think Fogo's tres leches was better because it was a perfectly sweet to the point where you won't get a toothache. Animal's was a bit too sweet for my liking. I have no idea how much the bill was, but appetizers were around $12, entrees were around $23, and dessert was $7 each. There's valet but plenty of parking on the street. THERE IS NO SIGN to this restaurant! When you see, "Out of the Closet" you are very close! This place was recommended by several friends, but nothing really stood out to me except the pork sliders.

Everything is uniquely DELISHHH!  Love how each item on the menu uses creative ingredients, and still tastes good.  It's definitely not one of those places that uses wacky ingredients and the end result is disappointing.  Animal surely does NOT disappoint.   Here's what we ordered for four people: - Chicken liver toast (one order comes with just one piece of toast, so we ordered two) -- pretty gamey just to warn you all..one out of the four of us absolutely LOVED it..so she ate everyone's unwanted half and she was in heaven.  So this dish is hit or miss, depending on whether you're a liver-lover or not. - Lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac -- yummy, light salad totally complimented the other meaty dishes. - BBQ pork belly sandwiches with slaw (each order comes with two mini sandwiches/sliders, so we ordered two) -- once you bite into this, you're in heaven.  The texture of the coleslaw and brioche are perfect for the tender, juicy pork belly.  My 2nd time eating it, and I felt like it was an even better experience than the first time, if that's possible.   - Ricotta & goat cheese gnocchi, bolognese -- it was tastey, but it didn't really stand out to anyone.  Maybe because everything in the name was recognizable. :) - Melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread -- pretty much every table ordered this, partly because the aroma of the melted petit basque (sheep's milk cheese) and the chorizo was absolutely heavenly.  I typically don't even take a liking to chorizo, but biting into the chorizo and melty cheese on top of the grilled bread was one of my favorite memories from Animal. - Poutine with oxtail gravy & cheddar -- delicious, but super heavy.  Best if you order one for a party of 4-6 to share. - Ribeye with escargot butter on top -- pure craziness.  By the time we got the ribeye towards the end of our meal, I was about to burst.  From the few bites I had, it was a delicious combo of ribeye and escargot.  But beware.  It says it's 'for two' but the size of the ribeye can pretty much feed a small village. Did I mention we got two desserts too? - Bacon chocolate crunch bar -- they definitely do not skimp out on the bacon for this dessert.  After savoring one bite, I realized that the chopped up bacon topping mixes really well with the dark chocolate ganache and rice crispy-like topping.  It's SUPER rich, so I suggest sharing this for your table.  Duff from Ace of Cakes introduced this dessert on that program "The Best Thing I Ever Ate with...Bacon" and he proclaimed it to be the best thing ever and it looked like he could easily eat two platefuls.  It may be the best thing ever for some, but since I'm more of a savory girl, one bite of this is plenty for me. - Panna Cotta -- it was so-so, but pretty refreshing after our huge meal. Animal is definitely one of my faves.  My suggestion is to go with a group of 4-6 friends, order a bunch of appetizers and maybe an entree or two, drink a bottle of wine, and you'll definitely enjoy Animal to the fullest!!

This place is appropriately named animal bc you gorge yourself like an animal at this place.  My friends call this grazing.  I guess you don't have to gorge yourself here but my date and I couldn't restrain ourselves.  It was so heavy, and so worth it. we had chorizo cheese dip, so good.  So rich, delicious, made perfectly.  Then we had bone marrow and chimichurri which was good, also very rich and I loved the chimichurri but it definitely overpowered the marrow.  Next was rabbit legs with mashed potato in a buttery sauce, this was my favorite dish, rabbit was sooo good and I loved the sauce.  Finally we had the loco moco which is hamburger topped with spam and foie GRAS .  The foie GRAS was so good; eat it all together and u feel like u might have the best heart attack of your life. The food here is great, service is good, and we saw a couple celebs and a lot of trashy hotties.  It's pretty cool and the menu changes daily.  Reasonably priced and delicious, just maybe stick to two things on the menu bc it is all so heavy.

The name of the game at this place is rich, decadent dishes with some really nice flavors. Got 4 dishes here. Started with some melted cheese, chorizo, and onions. It was good (as you would expect from melted cheese and sausage). Second was a marrow and chimichurri dish. It was very rich and the chimichurri was nice and spicy. Next was rabbit legs with green beans and mushrooms. The sauce was really nice. Last was a loco moco dish that included a quail egg, rice, a burger, spam (yes, spam), foie gras, and some kind of Asian sauce. It was as intense as it sounds. Really good, but really heavy. The service here is great. It's also a good place to go if you are looking to see celebrities (there were 2 of them there when I went). This is intense and heavy food here though, so you need to be ready for that if you come here.

a neat new place in the mid-city area. are you a person who disregards animal welfare and really loves a big, fatty piece of foie gras? i am!!! are you tired of eating foie gras with figs or other fruits? is it getting boring? do you need your foie gras to man-up? i did! that's why i ordered the foie gras at Animal.. do you like biscuits with sausage gravy? i do! WHAT IF SOMEONE PUT THEM TOGETHER? FOIE GRAS ON A BISCUIT WITH SAUSAGE GRAVY? FUCKING AWESOME! whooooooooo! ok.. aspragus and bacon and poached egg salad. this salad is sooo overrated by you yelpers. it's... limp. and doesn't taste special. but-- the ribs that we ordered as our third starter were pretty good. i am a girly girl and i feel like i am getting sort of excited in a manly dude way talking about this place. like maybe i should smash a beer can on my head or something but it would have to be a really good beer. actually... no. i would never smash a beer can on my head. let's move on. for our main course my boyfriend and i shared the big bone in cowboy ribeye. we ordered it medium rare. obviously. i'm no amateur consumer of red meat. our steak came out.. blue-rare. practically still alive. and the most unfortunate thing about it is that i had started to cut this giant piece of meat in half and the restaurant is pretty dark so i didnt even notice how rare it was until it was almost sawed in half. i was really bummed. especially because the waitress told us when we ordered that it was the last one. she was a little bit smartassed when i told her that it was undercooked and said "so you want it more cooked?" all annoyed. i'm like.. yah sugar--- i wanted it medium rare. not alive. dayum. it came back out cooked really unevenly which is to be expected since i sawed into it but it was still pretty good. i look forward to trying it again and hoping that they get it right. next time i will inspect it more gracefully so that i can be sure it's to temperature without destroying any hope of it being fixed. kitchen here is tiny. restaurant is bare in a nice way. chefs look like convicts with a lot of tattoos. i dig it. it makes sense somehow. for dessert we ordered one of each thing. the bacon brownie tasted like dirt. it's all novelty. it's not great. i have had chocolate and bacon together before and it hasn't ever been really great but this one is kind of especially boring. however! the cobber/crumble thing here of blueberries and white peaches was reeeeeally good. the other dessert was toast with marscapone. it needed somethng else. like honey or jam. then it would have been great but otherwise it was just okay and not very memorable but that cobbler was realllllyyy amazing.

If this place wasnt so loud it would have been 20 stars. I couldnt even hear my wife talk to me from across the table. To some men out there, though, that may sound desirable. It would be perfect for a first date with an actress. Get the shaved asparagus and the 109 steak for 2. It is a divine meal. world class perfection. One of the best meals I have had in LA and one of the best steaks I have ever had.

this was a surprise vday dinner. .I remember telling matthew that although I've never been here but from the reviews and menus Ive seen, this restaurant fits my personality perfectly(and if he were a restaurant, I told him he'd be my bouchon) complete opposites but that's why we're quite the kick ass duo. brash, deliberate and delicious,  I am animal restaurant. what we ordered: six hour bolognese, parmesan soft polenta- extremely flavorful, a bit too flavorful and salty. double the soft polenta ratio and now we're talking. fried chicken livers, jalapeno slaw- yes, everyone knows i love my offal meats. this one's deep fried, even better. the jalapeno slaw was the perfectly sweet, cool, and spicy compliment to the pipin' fried chicken livers. we loved this dish. possibly matthew's favorite of the night. pork ribs with a salad of apples, grapefruit, grapes, etc.- WOW. the glaze is rich in flavor, sweet and a tad salty. the bones were literally so soft they were juicy. again, the salad on the side with its sweet and citrus flavors, complimented the brash flavor of the ribs perfectly. quite possibly my favorite of the night. duck breast, parsnip, apples, bacon, marshmallows, peanut brittle- think refined thanksgiving on one "simple" platter. the duck breast was cooked perfectly and could have easily been mistaken for pork belly. loved the toasted marshmallows. the peanut brittle gave it the extra crunch and sweetness, that made this dish amazing.  the portion size was a bit disappointing though considering it was an entree caramel donuts- pipin' hot and sinfully delicious. they warned us they were almost out of these so we snagged them quickly and they surely did not disappoint. we both agreed these were much better  than the ones we had a few weeks back at blt steak. for a menu maven like me, the menu was just jam packed with too much goodness. the combinations of ingredients are ridiculously brash. i love it. there are just too many things we wanted to order. there will definitely be a next time and good news, on weekends animal is open til 2am! a great spot to just stop late night and have a casual meal at the bar  (like tom collichio was spotted doing a couple weeks back) dishes that sounded amazing but will save for future visits (note: this is how u talk dirty to choisauce): pork belly, kimchi, peanuts, chili soy, scallion duck confit, apple, dates, pecans, sherry vinaigrette poutine, ox-tail gravy, vermont cheddar veal sweetbreads, sweet & sour, crosnes foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy quail fry, grits, maple jus, long cooked chard, slab bacon DEFINITELY will be returning! (oh and since, I also read about the new foie gras loco moco heart attack on platter. OH L'AMOURRRRR)

This place is ok.  Very pricey and small portions.  The day I went a bunch of activists were outside picketing because Animal serves foie gras.  I've never had foie gras before so I decided to see what the riot was all about.  OMG the foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy was incredible.  Thank you activists for the recommendation on the foie gras... I would have never ordered it if it weren't for you guys!  I would have given this place a 3 star because it's expensive and you don't get much, but since the foie gras was that good and worth the price, I'm giving them 4 stars.  We spent quite a bit of money here and we left hungry so we ended up eating ramen after.

I was reluctant to come here.  I'm not a big fan of weird food.  Rabbits and quails and escargots...no thanks, I'm all into old fashioned BEEF.  That's it.  So I always like to look at the menu for a place before I go so I can look forward to a good meal.  I looked at this menu and I wondered if I was going to go hungry that night.  I went with a few friends that had already been there and they loved it.  They are more adventurous than I.  I let them order. I trusted their judgment.  Somewhat. :) We ordered ALOT of food....for four of us...people got greedy and wanted to try everything :) *chicken liver toast.  Not a big fan of liver.  I tried a bite..it was very...liver-y.  Couldn't eat the rest.  Gave it to my friend whom ended up eating mine, hers and my other friend's.  She was VERY content. *ricotta & goat cheese gnocchi, bologenese...gnocchi was very soft, sauce was ok, whole dish in general was ok...not the most flavorful.. *melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread...mmmmm this was a dream...a side of perfectly grilled bread that brought the perfect amount of crunch to it...and thinly sliced chorizo melted with cheese that you slaughter onto your bread... *lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac...this salad was surprisingly good...especially the beets, which I'm not a fan of at all..it was well marinated and soft...tasty.. *poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar ..this was essentially fries topped off with oxtail.  The oxtail was good, very tender and well seasoned...it didn't really have to sit on a pile of fries.   *BBQ pork belly sandwiches.  So, it's really hard for me to say something is REALLY good.  I don't say it often. Let me tell you, these freakin pork belly sandwiches were ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I"VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.  hands down.  tops.  anything.  these were HUGE chunks of pork belly...sitting in between two toasted and heavily buttered brioche bread.  I think the butter makes the pork belly and bread all melt in your mouth.  OMG I WANT SOME RIGHT NOW.  I've been thinking about this since I left the restaurant...oh til the day we meet again... *rib eye for two, escargot butter, mash..by the time we got to this, we were so full and had to take most of it home.  Looking at snails on top of my steak was pretty disturbing so I knocked them off and told them to git.  The steak was delicious on its own.  I would have devoured it if I wasn't ready to hurl. But of course, we had to have dessert we had the panna cotta..delicious....and the bacon chocolate crunch which I was really curious about, but didn't really do anything for me, even though I DIE for bacon and LIVE for chocolate...the two things didn't really go together for me.  No harmony or angels singing for me there.  Keep it separate.   I give five stars for the cute small location, trendy and simple...and for the PORK BELLY SANDWICHES.  MMMMMMM

The melted petite basque and chorizo appetizer served with garlic bread is a must.  The ribs appetizer is super delicious too.  I can't wait to try everything on the appetizer menu.  The flat iron steak and the quail fry entrés are rocking.

to say i was disappointed would be an understatement, and here is why...... we arrive and are seated not so promptly for a empty restaurant. when our server comes to the table she suggests her favorites, which is pretty much the whole menu. so, not very helpful, although she was cute. she also suggested going "tapas" style, which we were going to do anyway. more on this later. i do have to say i like what they did with space, its about as good as you could get. enough with the preliminaries, lets get down to brass tax, THE FOOD. we get a bottle of bubbly as its a b-day dinner for little me. its good but not much of a champagne type person. we order three apps and they are as follows: baby broccoli, poached egg, panchetta vin, and grana cheese - the broccoli had a gas taste to it, so it was probably flamed up in the pan too much, and the egg was over cooked, but you can never go wrong with panchetta. also under seasoned, which was a recurring theme. pork belly, kim chi, peanuts, chili soy, scallion - so-so, lacked real depth of flavor bone marrow, parsley salad - here is a real big dip in the road. when we began the waitress suggested tapas style. so here we are three of us and when the marrow arrives there is two pieces of bread. when we asked for a third piece, we were told that we would have to pay two dollars for one. a little stink eye by one of my dining partners and a free piece of bread arrived. these are the small things that make or break a restaurant, they know that three people are sharing, as they suggested, so give three pieces of bread!!! the marrow portion is small, one bone, but it did come with half a ramekin of really good maldon sea salt. the problem though was that so much of the rest of the meal was so under seasoned that i would have gladly given up most of that ramekin to have the salt put into my other dishes. branzino, fennel, olives, tomato, borlotti beans, green garlic - this was ok, again under seasoned. the borlotti beans are very meaty and over powered the branzino. flat iron, hotel butter, artichoke & potato hash - i think they forgot the artichoke.... steak was high quality and real tender, however it was settled for too long and started to congeal. pssst, put some of that maldon salt on the top of the bad boy! balsamic pork ribs, roasted parsnips & carrots, pine nuts, raisins - my dining companions ordered these. i would never order a $37 rack of pork ribs unless it came with a hand job....again under seasoned dessert - AKA the savior of the meal bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise - i LOVE chocolate and bacon, LOVE it. enuff said. donuts with caramel sauce - also very good i failed to mention we had a bottle of A to Z pinot from oregon which was very good. i want animal to be good, i really do. i talked to the one chef when i was there, and he seemed really cool. the place was not all stuffy and pretentious, and everyone seemed happy to work there. i liked the feel of the place and liked the food ideas. its just the food fell a little flat. i will give it some time and go back and try it again, because i want it to succeed. i know my review is very harsh, but it is from a knowledgeable view point, and i want to give honest feed back. if the chef owners happen to read this, you are so close man, so fucking close! find that extra gear and you could be one of the top restaurants in this town. im pulling for ya!

animal is one of those places you need to make a doctor's appointment first to get on lipitor or some other anti-lipid medication.  this place will kill you... and send you to heaven.  the chefs here know how to bring out the meatiest flavor in the most sinful gluttonist ways. just take a look at one of their signature dishes: foie gras + buttery biscuits + thick rich maple syrup, all in one dish?  and then let's move on to what is undoubtedly one of the top five dishes in all of LA: their BBQ pork belly sliders, melt in your mouth messy goodness that leaves me gasping for breath in the best way.  the chicken liver mouse is also good an only $3 a pop.  actually, the larger more expensive entree type dishes aren't nearly as good as their smaller cheaper options, which is handy, as you will probably be stuffed after just the appetizer round, as everything is very rich and after one bite, you'll probably order more than your gallbladder can handle.  forewarning that you'll probably want to detox with a full vegetarian high fiber diet for the next week or so, but trust me all you meat lovers out there, it's worth it.

Animal. A powerful word isn't it? Loaded with thoughts and ideas. Like one of the coolest Muppet character's ever who would pound away on his drums with incessant force and bravado. Or, It can be carnivorous...sexual, heck even man's best friend, but ultimately it gives the customer a clue about what lies in the menu. Great name! Overall, the experience was nice and full of little surprises. I wasn't crazy about the space itself, being boxy and sterile. All the noise was pretty much trapped inside. At the rear of the room you will find a copper top bar; lovely and unexpected. OK, basically an invitation to order alcohol while waiting for a table to open up. Sold! I sampled some really delicious reds. Once seated, the staff made a good effort to connect and appetizers came and went... For the main course I chose the flat iron steak, which was accompanied by this OUT OF SIGHT sauce. It was creamy, rich, tart and tasted especially good with the bite size morsels of potato. The red wine with dinner was served chilled and I wondered why. No biggie, I'm just not used to that. For dessert, we tried the recommended chocolate bar and bacon bits concoction, surprisingly good. Well, I'm a chocolate lover, and the bacon bits were about the same consistency of rice crispies so I kept trying to fool my brain into believing that that's what they were. So far so good until the bacon-y aftertaste hit. Wash all that down with a tall glass of milk and your good! Just for the record I thought the combination was adventurous, and something I would never try to replicate. This meal definitely made my taste buds stop and stand at attention. I'm wavering between 3 and 4 stars but I feel more "A-OK" about it than "Yay! I'm a fan." So there it is. I'm sure I'll be back.

if you didn't get a clue from the name, Animal caters to meat-eating foodies. even though the meats were surprisingly lean, you could easily fill up on meat-heavy appetizers alone. i went with a group, and most of us shared, so i was able to sample a range of appetizers and entrees on their single sheet menu. appetizers i found the appetizers to be more interesting than the entrees, though no less heavy on the protein. house smoked pork belly, lentil & butterbean salad- one of the better choices of the evening, the pork belly was a shockingly lean piece of meat with a section of fat. marinated in a thick bbq sauce, it was sweet on first bite and ended with an almost too salty finish. thankfully, the tangy vinaigrette from the beans cut through some of the intensity of the sauce. pork ribs, balsamic, delicata squash & rocket salad, pecans- smothered in a dark balsamic sauce, the meat was tender and easily came off the bones. the spicy rocket salad with sweet slices of squash balanced all the pork. the sauce was somewhat generic. poutine, ox-tail gravy, vermont cheddar- theirs is a gourmet version of a canadian specialty that consists of french fries covered in gravy and cheese curds. the gravy on this had pieces of ox-tail in it. without much to compare it to, all i can say is that french fries do taste good with gravy on them. the cheese was a little scarce on this one. entrees flat iron, sunchoke, lobster & chanterelle mushrooms, hotel butter- this is a quality, thick piece of meat. another diner in the group thought their medium rare was a little too rare, but i found it to be just right. the steak was tender, simply prepared and mostly focused on the natural meat flavor. personally, i would have preferred more mushrooms, less meat. halibut, king crab, tabasco butter, gold rice succotash, cipollini- one of two fish dishes on the menu, this one consisted of a piece of halibut that has been pan seared and covered with a good amount of king crab, plated with a mixture of beans and sweet corn and a butter sauce. i love crab, and it was good with the butter, so nothing to complain here. although the preparations are straightforward, and the flavors are a little uninspired, overall, i thought the food was tasty. the ingredients, fresh, high quality, mostly organic and locally produced/grown, were good. our waiter was attentive and friendly, answering the various questions from our large group. it's definitely not a place for vegetarians, but they do have fish and vegetarian salads, so if you wanted to eat a little lighter, it is possible.

If eating here is wrong, I don't want to be right. I loved my meal at animal. I thought their menu offered great variety and their dishes had exceptional flavor. We started with the kale salad. So simple yet so wonderful. The dressing was really good and the cheese and breadcrumbs were the perfect compliment to the kale. Next we had the pig ears. This was my second time having pig ears and they are probably my new favorite food. Animal's pig ears did not disappoint. Great flavor, I could have eaten the whole dish by myself. Next, the foie gras biscuit. I've never come across a fattened duck liver I didn't enjoy and this was no exception. Biscuits and gravy, yum. Foie gras in top, even better. Next, the pork belly sliders. More yumminess. The pork belly had a nice crisp and the cole slaw was a good compliment. Lastly, the oxtail poutine. Fries, cheddar, oxtail, can you really go wrong. The meal was heavy and rich but worth every calorie. I sure slept well that night.

This is right by my apartment and I walked there with friends. The pork chop is amazing and so is the bacon chocolate bar. Most shockingly, my friend Roxanne ordered a glass of wine, tasted it, and then didn't care for it and sent it back. This is rich people behavior. I was floored and inspired by her audacity and have added this move to my growing list of crap to pull when I'm hitman-hiring wealthy.

Delicious. Definitely something everyone should experience. The "tapas" style of eating makes the meal way more fun and allows you to try more things than simply ordering a single entree.   I usually would write more than this, but it seems like everyone else who reviewed this place already has the right idea...

BEWARE, MAJOR ARTERY CLOGGING FOOD.  Great pork sliders but I thought in general that everything was really salty.  Good ambiance/good vibe/good crowd and I'll probably go back and give their other dishes a try.

Warning: Upon entering this establishment you will be confronted with animals. Lots of braised, grilled, barbequed, and baked animals. Well after you order them off of the menu that is. It is certain that if you are vegetarian then this joint is probably not your style. Like about 1,000 other places in LA, I had heard great things about Animal. So I waited for an occasion to arise for experiencing this meat loving establishment and date night seemed like the perfect opportunity. The boy and I didn't bother making reservations, against suggestions from friends whom had dined here before. We figured they could surely fit us in. Well, to our dismay this did not happen. The floor was booked for the night, so we sat at the bar with hopes of a cancellation. After waiting for about 20 minutes we decided to just eat at the bar. No biggie. That's what we get for not making a rese! The restaurant itself was quite comfortable. Small and simple with warm lighting. The décor is pretty much the definition of simple actually. The bar is small, but the chairs were plenty comfy and the bartender was super friendly. We each ordered a glass of wine suggested by the manager (note that they only serve wine and beer here, so all you liquor drinking boozers be prepared). We were both pleased with her selections, especially after the food started to arrive. The pairings were on point. As far as grub goes we started with the pig ear (cooked in chile and lime topped with a fried egg) which was probably my favorite part of the meal. Well I say that even though the hamachi tostada (with herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut) was equally as amazing. The flavors in these two dishes were impeccable. The pig ear was slightly spicy and as you would imagine, nice and salty. The tostada had a wide range of flavors all complimenting each other very well. The combo of raw fish, tostada, slaw, cilantro, peanuts, oh my! Yep, I'll be having dreams about that one. For the second portion of our meal we ordered the barbeque pork belly sandwiches (topped with slaw) and the crispy rabbit legs (with peas, dandelion, meyer lemon aioli). Unfortunately, we were not nearly as impressed with these items. The sandwiches were good, but not $12.00 for 2 of them good. The BBQ sauce had good flavor, the bun light and fluffy and the slaw a nice compliment. The complaint here is that the pork belly was over cooked.  I love me some pork belly when it is prepared properly, but theirs was dry making it less tender than I am used to. Like I said, they were good, but not great. As far as the rabbit goes... this dish was, for us, just inedible. The breading on the rabbit had little flavor along with the meat. It too was over cooked. Also, the aioli that it is topped with had an extremely intense flavor. So intense that is just wasn't enjoyable. Too much seasoning and lemon for my taste. I felt that the sauce was just trying too hard. I like it simple and elegant. The vegetables which came with the rabbit on the other hand were great! The peas were plump and nicely cooked. After finishing most of our meal, while picking and prodding at the rabbit, the bartender cleared our plates and questioned how the meal was. We admitted that we didn't fancy the rabbit and he was more than obliged to advise the manager. The manager was very polite in understanding that the dish was just not quite our taste and removed the entrée from our bill. Awesome! Yay for great customer service! Since we opted out of eating our last dish we decided to try some desert to top the dinner off. We asked the bartender for a menu conveying our intentions. After looking it over we decided on the tres leches, unfortunately they had already run out of it for the evening. Bummer. Wish the bartender would have forewarned us since he knew desert was in our plans. So we decided on the bacon chocolate crunch bar (with s&p anglaise). I read some mixed reviews on this desert, but we had to try it ourselves to form our own opinion right? I mean, bacon and chocolate, two of my favorite things all wrapped in one? What could go wrong? I am happy to say that we were not disappointed. The sweet and salty and creamy and salty and crunchy and sweet all combined. Yum! We were very much pleased. All in all we had a good first time experience at Animal. I only wish it were slightly tweaked to be concluded as an awesome experience. The service, from valet to hostess, to the bartender and manager was fantastic, but certain food items were just not up to par. I am sure we will dine at Animal again in hopes of discovering more to-die-for menu items.

You'd only know where it was located if you read the valet sign...or I suppose if you'd looked it up on Google Maps. The latter we didn't do. However, from the website, http://www.animalrestaur… we knew it was only four store fronts north of Canter's. The front is plain, nothing special. Inside we were instantly greeted by a husky female host who seemed ever so pleasant and MUST love the food. The vibe inside was great, trendy- Hollywood-under-35-crowd, plenty of daters, but also quite a bit of large parties, which is odd in such a small restaurant. It was obvious you were in LA with all the fantastic exposed cleavage dancing out of all the same plain style dresses that were only differently discernible due to the plethora of colors. Siting between two of the many dresses was Seth Rogan. Seeing a movie star in a restaurant usually raise your expectations. Besides Seth Rogan and the girls in the restaurant the decor was pretty lame. The walls were plain, they needed art. I told the hostess we were a party of two, she asked if we had a reservation, but she asked it in that way that when the question is posed you realized that you should have made one, but you didn't and they know you didn't. Luckily, there were two spots open at the 7 seat bar, which sadly only faces the employee service station, 2 x 3 window to the kitchen and wine shelves. Because of the ramblings of the guests at the tables behind you feel like you are missing out on the party with your back to the restaurant. Lesson learned, make a reservation. The menu is filled with things you may have never heard of like, Pig Ear, Poutine, melted petite basque, sweetbreads and amberjack. There are also many recognizable items like barbecue pork belly, lamb chops, curried shrimp, flat iron, halibut and pork ribs. The waiter, Salomon, suggested a few items, we went with all his suggestions. This guy knew the food, he was on top of it, describing the items in that way that you know he not only eats her but he loves it. First came the Pig Ear (chili, lime and fried egg). This was....well, maybe the perfect food, spicy, yet perfectly tolerable. The Pig ear was sliced long like tortilla strips, it was crispy and perfectly salted. Almost felt like pepper salted bacon. The broken yoke from the fried egg perfectly completed the flavor and finished off your palette. Next came the Lamb Chops which were covered in beets, fresh garbanzo's and sumac yogurt. The combination was refreshing, crunchy and the meat was tender and juicy. The Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar is like a fancy chili cheese fries. Instead of chili there are oxtail chunks which were like the most delicate pieces of brisket. Oxtail is amazing. If you've never had it you must try it. The brown gravy oxtail sauce and chunks of cheddar cheese remind you of less harsh blue cheese crumbles. The Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar and Pig ear were so amazing we had to run it back again. We asked Salomon if we could get another order of both items but this time put the Pig ear and fried egg on top of the Poutine dish. He said the chef's wouldn't, but we didn't care, we just ordered both then slid the Pig ear dish on top of the Poutine. It was like the first time someone though to combine hot models in swimsuits and Sports Illustrated, like divine intervention. We forgot about the ribs (Balsamic Pork Ribs, blistered corn and zucchini in herb butter), cause they showed up and the rack of ribs was at least 18 inches long and slathered in sauce. This was sadly the most disappointing part of the meal. If the best Ribs you've ever had were a 10, (Baby Blues BBQ, Houston's or Bandera) then these were about a 6. They were super fatty and the BBQ sauce was so sweet it made the ribs hard to consume. Overall Animal was fantastic, I would highly recommend it, but forget the ribs, they were very average and over priced. Go with friends or on a date, but leave the vegans and vegetarians at home cause at Animal they'll be like a poor sick guy in the American Health Care System, hungry, confused and deprived of anything necessary.

This place is weird and awesome.  The menu items are ridiculous, and I mean that in a good way.  I went here the other night with some friends, and here's what we had: - pig tails "buffalo style".  These were really good. I recommend them, especially if you're a fan of buffalo/ranch combo. - BBQ Quail.  The quail was cooked perfectly and was good on its own, but the slaw that comes with it is a great extra touch.  Good stuff. - Poutine with ox-tail gravy & cheese.  AMAZING.  Rich, very filling, so good. - Pork Belly Sandwiches. AND WE HAVE A WINNER!  Probably the best pork sandwich I've ever had in my life.  It's unspeakably good.  It's so good, that they won't let you take it "to go".  It has to be eaten at the restaurant, seriously, that's a rule.  You can't take it "to go" because it won't be as good.  I like that rule. I'm a big fan of this place now and can't wait to go back.  They say they switch up their menu a lot, so I'm excited to see what's next.  I felt like Andrew Zimmern eatin' those pig tails.   Service was top notch.  The place is cool.  All good...and weird.

If you like meat, this is your place.  The pork sliders were delicious and the best thing I had the whole night.  The pig ear had a good kick to it. The foie gras, biscuit and gravy was good, but maybe a little too heavy and rich for me.  The melted petit basque and chorizo was decent, but I wouldn't order it again.  I don't particularly like sweetbreads, but I guess anything fried can be enjoyable. The poutine reminded me of high end chili cheese fries.  I liked the Tres Leches cake, but found the pie to be underwhelming. The place is kind of obscure and make reservations in advance.

this place has amazing food. my favorite dish was probably the six hour bolognese with parmesan soft polenta. so tasty!! and they have a bacon crunch chocolate bar which all the people i went with seemed to love. i don't like bacon so i'm not the right judge of this. and yes the place is hard to spot. it has no signage outside. one of "those" kind of places. need to know where you are going type deal. but eh, it's worth it. the food kick's ass.

Give in to your inner carnivore instincts and let loose at Animal.   The dishes are whimsical and delicious, not to mention perfect sizes for sharing.  Some of my favs were the pork belly sliders, poutine (think fancy smothered fries), foie gras biscuit w/ gravy, and grilled squid.  The truffle parmesan fondue that comes with the flat iron steak is out of this world.  Although it can probably be said that I've yet to meet a grilled squid that I didn't like.  The atmosphere is casual with minimal decor but all in all a great place to enjoy a fun meal with some friends.  Seth Rogan was spotted at the next table.  Make sure to try the bacon chocolate crunch bar while you're there.

If you consider yourself to be a true foodie, look no further than Animal.  This restaurant takes meat to a heavenly level.  Some of the dishes are definitely capable of converting any dedicated vegetarian into an avid carnivore.  The amberjack was the perfect starter--- this light, delicious raw fish blended perfectly with the thinly sliced apples, melons, citrus and herbs.  I couldn't put my fork down once while eating it.  I have to order the barbeque pork belly sandwiches every time I'm there.  Quite simply, it's CRACK in a bun.  If I don't order it, I make my friends get it so that I can swipe a few lusty bites!  If it's on the menu, go for the rabbit legs.  At first glance, this dish seems so simple with its sides of bacon, peas and dijon.  But let me tell you, whoever the chef was, he was Jesus turning water into wine!  I think my boyfriend said it best when he called it "couture junk food."  The lamb chops were excellent, charred nicely on both sides and full of flavor.  This dish was another example of how you don't need a thousand ingredients to send it to the realm of the divine.  And speaking of divine, DON"T LEAVE until you order the tres leches for dessert.  Cake soaked in more crack...  That's all I gotta say. Make sure that you call ahead if you want a table.  However, if you're only with a couple of friends, I'd skip it and head to the bar.  The owners and bartenders are friendly and love to talk about food, wine, and just about anything else.  Good times!

I'm usually really good at keeping secrets, and, for my own good, I really shouldn't be sharing this secret with you. But I left Animal in awe and would feel terrible if I didn't share Animal with the world. The enthusiastic, almost cult-like, reviews are true. Animal is an amazing restaurant: unique, unpretentious, and its food is absolutely delicious. I was unimpressed by their plain decor. But as soon as my first plate for the night (chicken liver toast) was served, I could have cared less if I was eating in a toxic waste dump. Animal's food will make you forget everything--including standards for good food. Below is a breakdown of what I had for the evening: Chicken Liver Toast - savory, rich, and delicate on the first bite. Those who don't appreciate the taste of liver will not enjoy the after taste of this dish. I would skip if you aren't a big liver fan. Pork Belly BBQ Sliders - a MUST have. Crispy on the outside, juicy and fatty on the inside pork belly served with slaw between two slider buns. Only for those who enjoy juicy, full-flavored sliders. Fried Pork Ears with Lime and Fried Egg - For those who fear pork ears, this is a great entry dish. Everything fried and drizzled with lime is good. The crunchiness of the pork ears combined with the softness of the fried egg is a beautiful (and unexpected) combination. This dish truly demonstrates the forethought put into this dish and skill of Animal's chef. Poutine in Ox-Tail Gravy and Cheddar Cheese (think chili cheese fries) - thickly cut french fries served in a heap of sweet (incredibly rich and bold) ox-tail gravy and cheddar cheese. Unfortunately, we ordered this AFTER our appetizers and entrees and shamefully struggled to finish the last bite. Foie Gras Loco Moco - a three deck tower of hamburger for foundation, spam for cushioning, and foie gras for the finishing touch. Hands-down, my most favorite dish of the night. While each on it's own is fine, it is the combination of the three together, intermingling in your mouth, playing against each others flavors (salty, sweet, spicy, tangy) and texture (soft, fatty, crispy, chewy) that truly makes this complex dish an inspiring and mouthwatering experience. I think a party of two is ideal for this restaurant as the dishes are small enough that you can try a good variety of appetizers and entrees, but big enough to split between two people. Unfortunately, the one bad thing about Animal is that the human body does not have the capacity to consume the entire menu in one night. But I guess our bodies are to blame for that, not Animal.

the pork belly sandwiches with slaw were delicious, the bone marrow yummy. the hamacha tostada was meh, the rabbit sausage with ricotta gnocchi was the worst - the sausage had this weird plastic aftertaste and the gnocchi had this odd lingering aftertaste that was off-putting. tres leches cake for dessert is a must but warning - very sweet. had that and the toffee pudding (toffee and bread pudding are my ultimate favorite restaurant desserts) but i actually liked the tres leches better here. server was very slow to serve us, was nicer and more attentive to the trio of middle-aged men to my right who were spending more money on wine than us. overall, i thought it was okay. that's pretty good considering how many people had raved about this place to me and hyped it up. still, been there and done that. i've had better overall experiences before.

I don't even know how to start my review, except with maybe  "Wow".  My friends and I checked out Animal recently and it was one of the best places that I've tried in a long, long time.  I pride myself on being an "alpha carnivore" so your basic meat and potatoes doesn't always cut it, but upon entering Animal it was like carnivore debauchery and music to my taste buds. We started off with the Pork Belly Sliders and I was already waiving down our server to order more before I even finished chewing my first bite. They were moist, succulent and just really effing good.  From there we moved to one of my most favorite dishes on Earth...Poutine. I first fell in love with it in Canada where it's huge ("eh") and I stood up and clapped  when they brought out a gorgeous plate of double cooked french fries covered in melted cheddar cheese and smothered with the most wonderful oxtail stew and gravy that I've ever had.  It was heaven on a plate and something you need to try before you die.  After that, we couldn't decide on which cut of steak to get so we did what any glutton would do and ordered both.  First out was the Flat Iron which was covered in a thick Parmesan fondue...stinky, rich and just decadent.  Next came the rib-eye for two which was ginormous and topped with garlic butter and a monster portion of escargots.  I started charging up the defibrillator just in case.  Both steaks were great, but I'm not sure the extra toppings were really needed.  I wasn't complaining though and it fit in with the decadence their overall menu.  We finished off the night with some piping hot homemade donuts with caramel sauce and their bacon, chocolate, crispy, whatchamacallit thingy bar...just brilliant stuff. As for the service it was good, but it did get a little slow once the place started filling up.  The only thing I wasn't really feeling was the utilitarian design of the place...kind of plain, dull and dim.  The prices are just a tad higher than I'd like for this kind of stuff as well, but they serve the best poutine in the World so I can live with it.  Overall I loved Animal and my review would be 4.5 stars if I could.

Loved this place! I went with two of my friends and we had the hamachi tostada (tasted like you were on vacation!), the kale salad, pork belly sliders, poutine and steak. I thought the steak would be right up my alley but actually was the weakest of the lot. We tried three desserts... the tres leches cake, bacon bar and sticky toffee pudding. All were solid but the sticky toffee pudding stood out. We were very happy with Animal and pleased that they didn't give away our reservations even though one of the trio was more than 15 minutes late, the cut-off time.

This place if for those who like to venture outside their comfort zone but not at an extreme level.  The menu is avante-garde with dishes ranging from pulled pork sliders to chili lime pork tongue and ears.  (These were the dishes I tried and were amazing and packed with flavor!) Forewarnings : reservations a must since it is a small place and busy.  Also, not for those who have a huge appetite, smaller portions compared to other restaurants.

Trust the Pigs Ear ... strange though it may seem the sweet and sour pigs ear is one of the greatest dishes I've ever eaten, and animal does it right. Plus a plethora of other amazing dishes. This is one of the only restaurants in LA that I really loved every dish we had (and I've been there several times) ... the sweet breads, the sliders, the salads, the chocolate bacon, the burrata it's all amazing. Slightly pretentious atmosphere, but decent wine, and rad food done with exquisite ingredients and a flair for demanding originality. Oh and MEAT - if you're one of those annoying LA faux vegetarians you wont like it here! They love the pig and the other beasts and they know how to  beat it and eat it!

Animal, located in Hollywood, is the kind of place that local chefs go to after they get off of their shifts. Open until 2 a.m. and serving great quality meats and offal prepared to perfection at an affordable price, makes this place an amazing option for both tired chefs and late night food finders like myself. The menu is printed every so often, which I can assure you, makes for an option of great seasonal items. By the way, my boyfriend and I sat next to Alex Guarnaschelli, Chopped judge and executive chef of Butter Restaurant. Bonus! (That's how you know the restaurant is good, when esteemed chefs dine there...not to mention, if you watched "Best Thing I Ever Ate" on Food Network, Animal is home to Duff's favorite, bacon crunch bar...HELLO bacon and chocolate!! c'mon!) This was the very first time I tried sweet breads. I've heard nothing but amazing things about sweet breads in general, and I've always been a little skeptical about trying them. Let's see, animal thymus...not exactly on my "I'm dying to try it" list. But, it was on my boyfriend's and I thought, "What better place to try sweet breads than Animal, plus its affordable!" So there began my new found love for thymus! It was crispy and caramelized on the outside and smooth and creamy on the inside. It had a really delicate offal flavor, not off-putting as I often find in liver. It tasted of savory crusty meat, then a slight irony flavor right at the end. It was amazing...heavenly offal. I don't know how often you hear about offal being heavenly, but this was pretty damn good! For my entree, I had the steak with fondue. And may I say, this was great! The fondue was extremely smooth and flavorful--tasted almost like a dense, cheesy, bachamel sauce. That poured over a perfectly done med-rare meaty steak...can a girl ask for anything more?! Granted, Animal is a diet breaker, but well worth it. As if I haven't emphasized enough...this was Food&Wine Magazine's 2009 rising chef's pick and it's incredibly friendly on the pocket! Enjoy! P.S. Parking is not much of a problem.  And if it is, Animal offers valet for $5, which...is really not that bad!

This place has great food but I am not sure if I am convinced that Los Angeles food scene is as great as Chicago's. I will say that the dishes on the menu were very unique and very good. The meat that they use is not something that is always typical which is always refreshing.  The desserts were good but not great. Our server was awesome and that made it a great experience. Oh and I also wish they had a drink menu. The only thing they have is wine and a few beers.  I would go back with more people next time so that we can order more dishes.

This review is not for the food, since we ended up not eating here; it's for the customer service. OK so I totally get the new hip small restaurant attitude, but a rude hostess is not necessary.  We had made a reservation for 6:30 on a Sunday for 4, and three of us arrived at 6:20 and asked to be seated.  Out of the 15 or so tables in the restaurant, there were people at 2 of them.  The hostess said they don't seat incomplete parties.  I am aware this is a standard policy for small restaurants so that tables are not occupied for longer than the reservation slot, but come on - there were practically crickets chirping in the background, and 6:30 on a Sunday is not exactly prime restaurant time.  Plus, there were three of us there for a 4 person reso, and we would have been seated at a 4top regardless, and our 4th person was finding parking.  Due to these circumstances, we asked if we could please be seated, and the hostess SCOFFED (!) and said "um, it's against our POLICY.  You can wait outside or at the bar." Get over yourself b*tch.  If you had apologized nicely and said there was nothing you could do, you're sorry, etc then it would have been totally cool.  As soon as our 4th person arrived less than 5 minutes later we left to go somewhere else.  We won't be back.

I have been disappointed by this restaurant twice...my fault for returning, but I wanted to give it another chance knowing some people had enjoyed their experience. I learned that the chef's own a successful catering company in LA, and the first thing that came to mind is that I would have been impressed by the food had I been presented with it at a catered event....the bar is pretty low. For a restaurant, and a higher priced restaurant, the food concepts fall short.  The menu sounds fun and playful, but the playful flavors do not actually work well. Additionally, the restaurant has a strict reservation system. We had a party of 5 and were told that our reservation would be given up if we weren't there within 15 and that we would be charged $45 for each person who did not come. So, we were 5 minutes early and ended up waiting for 30 minutes. When finally seated, we were brought to a table that had been available the entire time. Fine, it happens, but there when we pointed out the irony of the fact that they were so strict and had fallen short on their customer promise, they blew off our comments. Never going back.

Excellent!  Don't go if you are not ready to dive into offal in all it's glory!   My personal recommendation would be the everything foie gras (enjoy it while it lasts! 2012 looms near!), pig ears, bone marrow, and the poutine!

i'm so glad i chose to take my bf here for our anniversary dinner. so clean, so hidden, it's like a secret spot no one knows about. the service from the  moment we walked in to the moment we walked out was really above and beyond our expectations, i almost felt like a novice angeleno, thinking that all the ppl in LA were this happy. as if! anyway, we got the shaved asparagus and petit basque to start. the shaved asparagus was a hit with us, especially since we just came in from the sweltering heat. it was refreshing and light with just enough protein (eggs, meat chunks). the petit basque was a bit harder to like because it wasn't the cleanest to eat, and it was a bit on the heavier side for such a hot day. i feel that this dish would be more appreciated in the winter or after drinking a lot when you want that greasy hot mess all over your mouth (and hands). my bf aptly said it tasted like leftover cheese from a pizza. that probably has a lot to do with the chorizo chunks in the cheese, which made it almost taste like a gourmet pepperoni pizza top. i probably enjoyed the basque a bit more than my bf. on to the main course. i ordered the flat iron and bf ordered the mahi mahi. both came out really really delicious, beautiful, and juicy. my flat iron was cooked exactly the way i wanted (medium) and the buttery sauce on the plate went so well with the steak and the corn that decorated the side of my steak. i cleaned my plate! bf also scarfed down his food and said it was very good. he doesn't usually order fish so he was surprised at how much he liked it. for dessert, we were too curious to pass up the bacon fudge. i knew the fudge would be a bit more overpowering than the bacon and wasn't surprised that it did. at first we didn't taste the bacon until after we had swallowed. THEN, the smoky bacon flavor filled our mouths and set off a bunch of questions in our heads. do i like it? is it weird? we loved it. we ate the entire plate of rich ass fudge. yum. def. going. back.

what a cool concept. take a bunch of carnivores and cram them into a small woody dining area. we totally passed it on the first try...what gives with modern places lacking signage?? anyway, that steak was scrumptious! everything on my plate tasted like it had been soaking for hours, flavors melding together in buttery harmony. too bad my date's fish plate had al dente beans (antonia's pigeon peas come swiftly to mind) ... quite the scene-and-be-seen establishment. minus one star for a $5 diet coke - no glass, no straw....not cool!

I know Animal was the hot spot last summer but I didnt get to try it till 2 months ago...I def shouldve came earlier.  This place is great for a casual dinner but expect great quality food and good service.  I think their menu changes on a weekly basis, pretty clever of them, it makes me want to come back to try new dishes every so often.  I like the restaurant's setup too, nice and simple, they made good use of a small space.  Unlike Hatfield's, I was definitely more focused on their food here and wasn't bothered by the lack of decor and ambiance.

I have a confession:  Hubby and I came here primarily for their chocolate bacon crunch bar.  And we're glad we did.  It was AWESOME. The food turned out great as well. And best yet, we got Vinny Dotolo to sign my cookbook!!  Now I just gotta go back and get Jon Shook to sign it as well.  Yay!!   The evening started out quite pleasantly.  Please be warned that you need to be prepared to self-park a block or so away.  They only had one valet guy working on a Saturday night so that means he's either parking a car or picking up a car at peak dinner time.  We self-parked. Everyone was super friendly and efficient.  We don't think we waited any longer than usual for our food except our shared entree.  Our server was very professional and had a lot of good feedback for us. We went to town and ordered the following: Deep fried hominy with lime:  Ok either they were yellow colored limes or they gave us lemons.  Regardless, this little finger snack was addictive. Pig Ear: I loved this dish but hubby was only OK with it.  When you break up the egg yolk and stir it up, it tastes like buffalo pigs ear, crispy and unctuous. Grilled Sardines:  Hubby and I dared each other to order this dish.  We haven't been huge fans but decided to be adventurous.  The first few bites were a little fishy but we overcame that and came to really enjoy the dish. BBQ Pork Belly Sliders: HEAVEN in your mouth.  We thanked our server profusely for recommending this after we thought we were done ordering.  Divine. Quail Fry:  I believe that anything deep fried is good.  This was great.  I could have 10 of these suckers.  Only gripe was the "polenta" underneath tasted a little "flour-y" and uncooked. Foie Gras Loco Moco:  For all you traditional loco moco fans, this is nothing like what you're used to.  Aside from two ginormous pieces of foie gras, they laid on a scant piece of spam (kind of chintzy in comparison the amount of beef and foie gras we got), a huge ground beef patty and some sort of soy sauce base.  I think I understood the dish and really really enjoyed it.  It was definitely very decadent and a great way to end our savory dishes. Back to dessert.  Next time we are ordering two, one for the restaurant and one for the road (who are we kidding, it's not making it all the way home).  This perfect combination of bacon and chocolate brings tears to our eyes. Thanks, Jon and Vinny, for providing such a wonderful and meat-tastic experience!

Early this year a friend and I had gone to this place randomly before even knowing anything about it or even checking our friends reviews. This was where I was introduced to sweet breads, which are quite tasty.  They bone marrow was also good. The duck confit was not bad but pretty typical of the ones we've had. Sadly there were only 2 of us so we couldn't go crazy and order more. Definitely would come back.

Have been wanting to try animal since it opened.  ..I finally got there tonight.  Our reservation was missing but the hostess offered to seat us as long as we were gone by 8pm.  Our waiter was nice and helpful which was good because one look at the menu and we were overwhelmed.  Luckily a few dishes that looked good to us were suggestions made by the waiter.  Unfortunately we picked too many dishes that were rich and had a hard time finishing.  My two favorites were the hamachi tostada and the ribs. . .so yummy.  My only negative comment - I wasn't feeling well and asked for some bread. . .they actually have the nerve to charge for toasted sourdough.  We commented and the waiter took the charge off. . But the point is that they charged us.

Went to Animal a few days ago to celebrate the imminent departure of Lady B (yelper supreme, unlike lazy me).  We three ladies came with high expectations - thanks, Yelp - and weren't at all disappointed. All the appetizers looked so fantastic that we couldn't forgo them in favor of entrees, so we went for a big shared meal of 5 starters. Shaved asparagus (great); raw cubed hammerjack (who knew that was a fish? Lady B did, and it was lovely); the famous ribs (absolutely awesome, earning rave reviews from even our Memphis native); the biscuit with foie gras gravy (really good and not overly heavy, amazingly); and the fried stuffed zucchini blossoms (actually the worst of the bunch; way too heavily fried and not airy as they should be).  For dessert, we had the bacon chocolate thingy (definitely not a brownie - more like fudge ganache), which was OK but not stunning, and the fruit cobbler, which WAS stunning. Stunning, I tell you. I am a cobbler snob, and this got full marks. Oh, and the bottle of rose we chose was nice as well, and not horribly expensive at all. Thanks, Animal, for helping our alcohol dependence persist (and yes, after our bottle here, we did go across the street for more booze at The Dime).  The atmosphere was fun, the table of raucous dudes who were way too old to be yelling as much as they were was only slightly annoying, and the waiter was friendly (if not entirely punctual with our order-taking). Thumbs up. I'd go again, fer shur.

They were out of foie gras! and that is why I went in the first place. But instead I tried the rabbit ravioli, quail, chicken livers, and "sweetbreads," which are neither sweet, nor bread. And they were all pretty good. Bonus points for being an eating establishment that has turned its back on vegetarians.

Where can I begin...Love Love Love the minimalistic decor and the bar area. The food is all made to order with the best ingredients, and the dishes are both American and international in taste. I recommend the oxtail with cheese fries, sweet bread, spicy pig ears with chili and  a fried egg, the steak, and the rabbit shanks. Be advised to ask your waiter what the dishes are before ordering, some of the are a bit exotic and contain animal organs. The cocktails here are well made and I recommend the Holy Grail beer.

Heard about this restaurant watching Top Chef DC....could't wait to try it out.  You must make reservation way out in advance to get a good time.  I loved the diverse menu choices of foods and the Tapas style dining.  We love to share each others food! We started with the Hamachi Tostado that had the most delicious tasting citrus slaw I have ever had.... to die for!  The Thai Quail dish and the Bone Marrow were also a hits BUT, the Pork Belly sandwich was the BEST we've ever had!  Desserts were so decadent!!  We had the Chocolate Bacon Bar and the Sticky Toffee bars.....amazing!   5 STAR FOOD! I do wish they severed more than beer and wine.  :) The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating was because of the service.  My husband made reservations for our anniversary knowing I really wanted to try it out for some time. When we arrived the "very nice" hostess wished us happy anniversary, this impressed my husband because he had told them this when making the reservation. Great start! The waiter we had wasn't so great.  He was kind of "not interested" acting if that means anything. He did ask us if this was our first time here, we said yes and he gave us a quick explanation of how the menu/Tapas style dining works.  Anyway he was just average.   The real disappointment came at the end when the waiter quickly dropped off the check (on his way to another table) and said something like "$50 was paid for by...." ???  Not really hearing him, my husband then asked him to come back and explain, he said $50 was paid for by "Becky" and he walked away.....again.  We then figured out the "Becky" was our daughter paying for part of our anniversary dinner.   When calling our daughter "and son" to thank them for their kindness she proceeded to tell me the restaurant called her (11pm, she lives on the East Coast) and woke her up from sleep to tell her they were sorry the "Manager" did not get a chance to issue the "gift certificate" she had asked for.....BUT, not to worry that they would make it "special".   Three things happen the waiter didn't even mention it was a "gift" from our daughter, we figured that out after asking him to explain the $50 credit.  Second our daughter called 2 days in advance to have the gift certificate waiting for us when we got to the restaurant and the "manager" didn't have time to issue it?  Lastly, she was called at 11pm her (East Coast) time to tell her the certificated was not done "while" we were still in the restaurant. The "very nice" hostess did wish us a happy anniversary again when we were leaving.  Nice girl! There was nothing special about the service, sorry to say.  LOVED the food and the Tapas concept though.

Animal!!! What an appropriate name for this restaurant because 1) I think I ate like 10 different kinds of animals there; and 2) animal is an apt name to describe my party as we gorged on the food there.  I came with a large party so I got to taste a bit of everything on the menu.  I highly recommend the bone marrow and foie gras.

I came here last week with some friends and had dinner at the bar.  Between the four of us, we got maybe 10 dishes and drinks, and it was only $35 per person.  Food is original and flavorful.  My favorite was the pork belly sliders and pork ear.  The only thing that was not so positive was that the food took a long time to come out.  Other than that, service was great.

Baby broccoli w/pancetta and breadcrumbs was a delicious savory meal in itself, definitely a craveable item I could eat atleast once a week.

Amazing food!

They were out of ox tail poutine, which is an incredible dish. Our waiter lacked a little on personality, but didn't miss a beat when we ordered.  I can't wait to go back!!

I wanted to give this place 2 1/2 stars, but there's no option for that.  I gave it 3 stars because I did enjoy the food... pero... read on... My friend and I were very interested in checking this place out... the menu puzzled us a little and we ended up ordering 3 appetizers to share for our dinner: the melted basque (yum), the pork ribs (yum -- the meat fell off the bone), and the poke (just a'ight).  Of course we had to try the already legendary bacon brownie for dessert.  After a bite my friend said, "It tastes like I'm eating an ashtray."  I agreed and we both took another bite and pushed the plate away. It was definitely worth a try, the food was good (except the bacon brownie -- but seriously, it's bacon on a brownie, we should have known better), I will not go back, and I predict this place will close its doors inside of 6 months.

Wow. Wow. Again, wow. I walked by this place, as it's 1 block from my apartment, and it just looked exactly like a place I would enjoy. The decor, the vibe, the layout...looked like my scene. Then I went online and looked it up and found that it was very pork heavy. Being that not eating pork is the one Jewish thing I've held onto I was a little weary. But being the punk I am, I had to try the place that dared to serve bacon on a dessert in a kosher, orthodox Jewish neighborhood. I went with my friend Alex and ate what might just have been the best meal of my life. I started with the Apple Fennel salad which blew me away. Is a salad supposed to be THIS good? Incredible. Meanwhile Alex said "this is so good" literally 10 times about his Raw Amberjack app. We then both ordered the Branzino, a fish neither of us have heard of, but we figured we'd give it a shot. They brought out two HUGE fish and prepared/deboned them in front of us at our table. Think interesting and not gross, it really wasn't, and gave us a chance to talk to our very friendly waitress Ashley who provided great service all night. The fish was amazing. We both demolished it. We just had to keep going so we got the Strawberry poundcake and devoured that as well. 2 apps, 2 entrees, 1 dessert, and a glass of wine came out to $100. A small price to pay for the best meal ever (up there with The Foundry). I can't even imagine how good the pork must be! Challah back! ash xo Update: I continue to go here on a regular basis and keep bringing people to experience all that is Animal. It definitely helps that the menu is constantly changing the the staff is increasingly friendly. Love this place.

after a long waited anticipation..i finally get a chance to try this place..with all the raves from ppl n friends around..how can i NOT be eager to try it?? so, i got a reservation on a sat nite..first impression was how small this place is..second, it was very industrial n simple decorations..but so far so good.. we got seated in the corner table by the bar..the mabiance was just ok..but who cares? this place is filled with ppl..i was checking out other ppl's food around us..n of course before i got there i alrady kinda kno what i wanted to order..hehehehe..it's the magic of yelp reviews! we ended up ordering melted petit basque for starters..it was really good..it was warm,gooey, melty, cheesy n crunchy all at once..hmmm.. and then we ordered the barbeque pork belly sandwiches..it was pretty good cuz they actually put a good size of pork belly in the sandwich, i think it was a bit too sweet for me, but my bf LOVED it so much.. the next plate we ordered was the quail fry w/grits n bacon..i was kinda shocked at how small that thing was cuz what i saw from the pics on yelp seems a lot bigger HAHAHAHA..i kno i kno it's quail..but i wasn't xpecting something so small like that LOL..anyways..it was really good prob better than the pork belly for me..it was boneless, cruncy, sweet n salty..really  really good n i 'd def. recommended it.. for our big finish..we ordered the poutine w/ oxtail gravy.. O.M.G. it was pretty phenomenal for me..i was pretty full by the time our waiter served it to us, but boy oh boy it was really good..n yes, it was really heavy n filling too..which is perfect to be our last course..it's definitely highly recommended !! ok, so even though i said the poutine was our last course, turned out the bf wanted to try the bacon crunch bar..so we did..i wasn't too excited bout it cuz i'm juz not a big fan of  it..let's juz say i'm not happy hvin my bacon on my dessert or vice versa..i think it'd be a bit too weird HAHAHAHA..so i ate the other part of the bar which was mostly chocolate n my bf ate other parts that has bacon bits..it was quite a teamwork..at the end he said that he really like the bacon crunch bar.. service was good..the server was knowledgeable n helpful..although i think he could be a lil less overly "professional" n maybe a bit warmer/friendlier..i like server that likes to engage in a conversation or interactive..but hey, the food is great n i'd prob come back here again..maybe juz not in the near future..cuz there r so many places that i wanted to try..

i went to animal because we couldn't get a reservation at bazaar. the vibe of the restaurant was pretty cool, but despite there were a plenty of tables at 6pm, they still sat us at the bar, however i quickly realized this place gets packed very fast.  it was pretty entertaining to sit there because our cutie waiter was consistently checking on us to make sure how we were doing and if we were enjoying the food. so here is what we ate: polenta with some sort of ground meat tomato sauce: recommended by the waiter. i'm not a huge fan of polenta texture but went with it, the taste was good but still didn't like the glue-like consistency but then again, what do you expect from polenta??  to me, it tasted like good thick meat marinara sauce. bruschetta: really good! sweet caramelized onion and cheese were a nice combo. pork chop: recommended by that cute waiter.  however didn't understand why they would put dijon mustard as base of the sauce and ruin a good pork chop?! the sauce should never out staged the main ingredient, i felt that the dijon mustard sauce was too over powering and didn't accentuate the pork. very disappointing.. steak: now that was good! i wanted to start sucking the bone.  ; ) dessert - bacon bits brownie: honestly the waiter did recommend home-made doughnuts but we decided to go with the contrast between salty bacon and sweet brownie.  after we ate, uh- we should have gone with his recommendation.. i liked the fact that the wine prices were very reasonable and also have an option of ordering an half of a bottle. they even let us tried a couple of wine before making a decision so that was nice.   also when my friend asked for some bread  because we wanted to dip the bread to the sauce, our waiter brought out a full plate of baguette! overall, the experience was pleasant and the staff was friendly, however,  the noisy level was pretty loud.  so if you are sensitive to noise, perhaps take earmuffs with you. lastly, would i go back? hmm, not any time soon because the food didn't really wow me, however, i would go back if my friends want to check it out and as long as that cutie waiter is our server. dang, i forgot his name.  all i remember is that he's an actor, but then again, who isn't in this town..

The food is great, I didn't taste a dish that wasn't delicious.  The pork belly, basque cheese, flatiron steak, pork chop, berry crisp, and bacon chocolate bar were all excellent (I especially recommend the gigantic pork chops).  The loudness, sparse decor, and rustic nature of the food reminded me a lot of Village Idiot but with far superior food.  I love how small the menu was too, they choose just a few things and then execute the hell out of them.  Extra bonus because I saw Vinny and Jon, the owner-operators, in the kitchen even though it was a less-busy Monday night. The only two knocks against the place I have, and the reasons it's not getting 5 stars, are that the prices seemed a bit steep for what it was and there was a pretty major service/food hiccup.  I'm willing to excuse prices that seem 15% too high (again using a place like Village Idiot as a barometer) because the food was so good, I unfortunately just won't be able to go there as often as I'd like.   The service hiccup came in when my friend sent his steak back because it was ten times tougher than the other steaks at the table, all cooked Medium rare.  I tasted them all and his was noticeably, disturbingly chewy, like maybe it was a bad piece of meat.  Instead of just sending him a new steak, the waitress went back and forth to the kitchen twice and came back with arguments as to why the steak was fine and they all come from the same animal, blah blah blah.  Apparently, the kitchen thought my friend and everyone else who tasted the steak and agreed were idiots (which, to be fair, I am an idiot, but an idiot with a decent palate).   They did remove it from the bill and asked him if he wanted to order something else (though expressly not a steak, another dig at my friend) but by that point, we were all pretty soured by the tone of the incident and everyone else at the table was done because the whole incident was drawn out over 20 minutes of back-and-forth.  I don't put much blame on the waitress, I think she was just the messenger, but it would have been nice for a manager or chef to come talk to my friend and get the whole story.  As it was, we all left on a down note, which is a shame when the rest of our meal was so nice.  10% more effort on the service end and this would have bumped up from a positive experience to an all-time favorite.  It's a shame.

Salty, greasy and delicious...as good as it gets! Their dishes are so unique I promise you've never tried a similar dish anywhere else....the tastes are just out of this world. However, you should avoid this place if you're not a meat eater....and if you are you'll be in heaven. Come with an open mind and makes sure you're willing to try everything...as odd as it may sound.

I LOVE every thing about this place!  And it's not very often that i say that about a "new" restaurant in Weho.  I'm talking EVERYTHING!  John you ROCK!  Your place rocks, if i could give you 6 stars i would! The food  has character and speaks for itself. But John (one of the owners) mills about the tables in a disarmingly friendly way and actually has the balls to ask his patrons how they like the food?!!!  What a concept!?   The ambiance is great...homey, comfortable, urban, warm, inviting, simple.  Something you'd find in NY, and the food reminds me of 5 star places in San Fran.  I love how the menu changes with the seasons or what's at the Farmer's Market.   The boys here love acid, (lots of vinagrettes and pickled sauces) as my friend and i found out the first night we were there.  We gave our constructive opinions not at first realizing we were talking to one of the owners.   He was great, and offered other suggestions and was very friendly and curious to see how the rest of our small plates were to our liking.  Very cool!  So sweet of you John.  You make it worth our while every time. What we really wanted was the Pork Ribs, but after we ordered we found out they ran out!? UGGGGH.....GASP!?  RAN OUT OF THE PORK RIBS????  I think a look of sheer despair washed over me.  We searched John's face for smile or smirk, in case he was joking...but alas it was true. I felt like i had been punched in my gut.  ..... They ran out.   But the pork frenzy continued with Pork Shoulder, Pork Belly, also they put panchetta on the grilled romano beans with poached egg....(lots of acid, but ohhh so good!)  I think i finally met my match....someone who loves bacon more than MOI????   Dudes at Animal are animals alright!!!  They even put bacon bits on a chocolate bar for dessert?  Sounds downright crazy.....yeah crazy like a fox!  But i tend towards the cobblers and strawberries with homemade pound cake...YUMMMEEEE!   So my friend and i decided this is our place.  John remembered us the second time we came in (HELLOOO...second time in the same week!) Remember, we had to come back for the ribs!!  We were on a mission.  John promised us if we came back we'd definitely have us some ribs.  They did not disappoint.  We also had the amberjack, heirloom tomato salad, and petit basque.  I've had the flat iron steak there too and it is delish....you think "oh, it's going to be over done or tough and chewy" but it's tender and flavorful!  The whole time i was kicking myself for sharing it?!  Am i nuts?  I don't like to SHARE??? We could walk into this place at 12am in our pj's and no one would care. It's a great neighborhood spot, no attitude and terrific service.  Actually serves a full menu till 2a.m.???  LOVE THAT!!!   Go with friends, split a bunch of appetizers, order a couple entrees....the food fills you up fast. You dont' have to spend a lot to get a lot but honestly i haven't ordered anything on the menu that i wouldn't order again and again!  Save room for dessert! PS...the owner told me the best night to go is THURS. when the menu could be new and interesting after a day at the Farmer's Market! PPS....and seeing Ryan Reynolds there the first night i tried Animal ..well....c'mon, now...i could throw in an extra star just for the hunky eye candy?!

Returned to Animal. Had been there a couple times a year ago or whatnot and finally came back with my friend, who hadn't been before. We ordered a carafe of wine, which was nice and light and paired well with our dishes. What I love about the food here is that most things are rich but also fairly light. There's one exception, the poutine, which was so good, it didn't even matter. We waited to get this guy last, so as to have room. The bone marrow was solid, and I like I liked it more my first couple visits, but still good. The foie gras topped biscuit with maple gravy was as good as you'd expect it. The kale was light and wonderful. Have this come mid-meal because it's the ultimate palate-cleanser. The fried egg atop crispy pigs ear was one of the best dishes. It was so well-balanced. Loved this. The poutine had cheddar, oxtail and gravy. It was the heaviest, as I said, dish, but wonderfully addictive. It was one of those great tastes that you cannot get enough of, even as your stomach inches towards the brink of implosion. Our sixth and final dish were the two mini barbecue pork belly sliders. I get how some people weren't impressed with these but I thought they were awesome. I think they lack the adventurous quality some of the other dishes boast and given that, the price, some guests may not find it good. But it's damn good. That's why they're still busy on a week night after almost 3 years of existence. All six dishes were executed perfectly, well-balanced (some more than others, of course) and just so good that you'd have another. Service is solid and professional but also mellow. Great ambience. I was so impressed on my third visit that I'll be going back in a week or two. Seriously. This is the most consistent restaurants in L.A.

Tried Animal for the first time last night and we really enjoyed it.  Started with the buratta salad which was refreshing and the perfect first course.  The quail was perfectly cooked, rare and tender with a delicious sweet glaze.  Ribs were fantastic with a fabulous and complex sauce.  A little similar to the quail glaze so wish the waiter would have pointed that out. However it's a small quibble and we ate it with gusto.  Loved the marrow bone. I grew up eating roasted marrow bones so it was a blast from childhood with a sophisticated twist.  The chocolate/bacon dessert was yummy. Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Service was friendly, warm and efficient.  The place is noisy (lots of hard surfaces so the acoustics are bright).  It's lively but challenging for conversation at times.  We will definitely be back. And you should try this place.  The chef has a vision and it's beautifully executed.

so i backed my car into someone else on the way to spin and then managed to crack my iphone screen so much so that i had to get a new phone, all before 11am today. needless to say, today was not the best day. however, animal made it all better. i've wanted to try this place for awhile now, and you know how you're usually let down when there are high expectations? well, animal is like that hot guy you've wanted to hook up with forever in high school, and then you finally do and not only is it awesome, you find out he's got a great personality, too (nb: girls in high school, this guy does not exist)! in other words, this place surpassed all my expectations and more. in fact, it is officially one of my favorite restaurants. this is my happy place, y'all. i usually don't do a breakdown of the actual food i order at restaurants, but i will for animal, because high school crush + my happy place =  deserving of full detail. we ordered: bone marrow with chimichurri and caramelized onion - now i loveee bone marrow. if anything, i wish the chimichurri sauce was a little lighter so i could fully taste the umami-ness of the bone marrow. however, i can't complain as this was probably also the best chimichurri i've ever had. this dish came with some delicious buttery toast points. it was really just splendid. barbeque pork belly sandwich - this was probably my favorite dish, if only because i am a total sucker for pork belly. this literally melted in my mouth, and the rich fatty pork was perfectly offset by the barbeque sauce and the tanginess of the coleslaw. i could order 5 of these and keep going. pig ear with chili, lime and fried egg - the pig ear was delightfully crunchy, and the chili and lime paired wonderfully with the fried egg on top. in retrospect, this was possibly my least favorite dish out of what we ordered, and i still loved it, just not as much as i loved everything else. hamachi tostada - very thai-inspired, the hamachi was succulent, i loved the guacamole slathered on the tostada chips for a unexpected surprise. also, as one of the lighter dishes on the menu, this feels somewhat healthy, and is a nice break from the onslaught of the pork products (not that i minded). highly recommended. chicken liver toast - along with bacon, pork belly, bone marrow, etc., i adore pate. in college, i used to buy it from the grocery store (central market!) and eat it with crackers for dinner. this is like the elevated, grown-up version of my college dinner. the toast is thick and buttery, the pate is rich and creamy and everything pate should be, and there is some sort of balsamic vinegar on top to balance out the richness of the pate. superb, and for $3, why not live off this instead? had my college self had access to this dish, i would have probably gained the freshman 50. quail fry with grits, chard and bacon - the quail is lightly fried and reminiscent of your typical fried chicken. the sides are what make this dish - the grits are lightly sweetened and a perfect counterpart to the fried quail and the slight bitterness of the chard, and the slab of bacon. oh my god. that bacon. enough said. bacon and chocolate bar - this is basically the fancy version of the bacon and chocolate vosges bar (if you haven't tried that, you should), except like 1,000,000x better. yummy dark chocolate, little bits of bacon, some kind of delicious rice crispy crunch thing, all topped off with creme anglaise.   we also ordered a bottle of wine, and the entire meal still came out to about $50 a person. can i gush any more about this place? doubtful, but animal is definitely my new crush. at this rate, i can't wait to have another bad day and make it all better by coming back here. I LOVE YOU, ANIMAL!!!

Uneven quality.  Some dishes were well prepared, others were not.  The highlights were the barbeque pork belly sandwishes, the sweetbreads and the balsamic pork ribs.  The flat iron steak was completely over-cooked, the halibut was swimming in butter, and the desserts were nothing special (we tried the bacon chocolate crunch bar (their specialty), which was tasty, but not interesting - couldn't even taste the bacon).  The hostess had unnecessary attitude (we arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation, there were empty tables and she said we would have to wait to be seated.)   Our group of four each had an appetizer, main course, and dessert.  The courses did not come to the table at the same time, with the waitress having to apologize for problems in the kitchen.  I have no desire to return.

I was ready to be wowed by the food (due to a good friend's rec and Anthony Bourdain's show) and underwhelmed by the service (as is the wont in these trendy, hipster places). The end result was the reversal of those two items: service was excellent while food was underwhelming. We arrived at the place right on time but were expecting to wait at least a little bit for a table since it was quite crowded. It always seems as if reservations are a guideline rather than a rule at the trendier, expensive places but here, we were seated right away by a very friendly maitre d. The server came very quickly and asked if we had any drink orders. He would come back a few times as we were making up our minds (it took a little while since there are several choices and we were starving...didn't want to over-order since we probably wouldn't be able to eat the leftovers for a while). Once we ordered, the pacing of the dishes was perfect for me but a little fast for My Darling. Overall, though, excellent service from a solicitous but not obsequious server. The quality of service is a digression from the quality of the food which was...well the quality of the actual components of the dishes were quite good but the actual dishes themselves were not quite there. They were fairly tasty (with two exceptions) but nothing I would say was quite the revelatory experience that this place was lauded to be. With a lighter hand on the sauces, the dishes would have been improved. Let's start with the hamachi which was underneath a bed of greens within a tostada. It was so overly sauced that you would not be able to tell that the hamachi was there without actually lifting up the greens and poking around within the tostada. I mean, I did really like the dressing and the greens and the tostada but it could have stood alone without the hamachi. Too overpowering for a subtle fish. Next up was the pig's ears. Again, it was overly sauced in a vinegary-spicy chili sauce that it needed more than just the one egg to really cut all that sour taste. As with the hamachi, the dressing really overpowered any taste of pig. The pig's ears were so thinly sliced that you wouldn't have been able to tell what you were putting in your mouth without consulting the menu for ingredient items. I really liked the sauce but again, a little less would have made this dish really come together. Pork belly sliders were next and again, too much sauce in the coleslaw made it a bit of a gooey mess. Nothing special about this item. Last item was just awful. Now being from Montreal, I know poutine...I love poutine...and this was not poutine. From the price to the presentation, it was just awful. While I do favor the traditional poutine, I have tried and loved other versions. This one was more like frites sauce and not poutine since there was barely any cheese. A few strands of grated cheddar do not a cheese component make. The fries were super crispy which My Darling loved and the oxtail gravy had chunks of very good oxtail but it was too salty and missing the all-important curd cheese. It can be done with another cheese but cheddar is way too salty for an already salty dish...the use of curd cheese is to cut the salt in a way. Regardless, at $18, this should have been perfection and not the disaster it was. There are two special notes I must make about the menu. One is that they state that they "support" organic and/or sustainable farming. They did not state that they use only organic or sustainably-farmed items but simply that they support it. I find this kind of addition to the menu to be useless and self-serving. It almost smacks of Body Shop when they changed from "no animal testing on our products" to "we support non-animal testing". The second note is that their beverages are ridiculously over-priced. They not have serve a single wine by the glass that is not in the double-digits (except their house wines: chardonnay or cabernet sauvignon). Their house chardonnay reminded me of Charles Shaw. Now many of their vintners and breweries were not familiar which made me turn to the non-alcoholic drink menu to confirm their "over-pricedness". Lo and behold their diet coke was $4, mint tea was $5, regular coffee $4...ya pricey. Overall, the experience was mixed to say the least. This place is extremely loud so be prepared to scream at each other across the table to be heard. The street parking is limited (Fairfax always is...) but there is valet parking out front for $5.50. This place accepts cards.

Have to say this is one of the best restaurants in the city! Was thoroughly surprised becaused the menu does not sound that good (at least to me)  and I was reluctant to try it because I don't usually eat that much gamey food.  However, the chefs there are genius and I loved everything!  some of my faves were the hamachi tostada, Thai bbq quail, and the rabbit!

Um in my opinion most of the people who try this place are wanna be hipsters that think they're being brave. Names like Foie gras and rabbit seem extravagant  by you city folk, but it's really not that special. It's the whole idea of trying to eat outside of the box that's got LA wannabees all raving about this fake edginess. Good for the marketing of this place as being a "raw" cuisine place because of the bare decorations from a restaurant in the middle of the urban jungle. I wanted the rabbit but they were out so we got Foie gras -decent, Pork Belly Sliders - good, and some sweet bread - bland. After waiting for 1 hour for our food we were left wondering what did we eat because it felt like air. The portions were minuscule and the price was excessively overpriced. Serious just leave the city a little and you'll be able to find 90% of their menu at 1/2 the price or at least a more filling portion. Haven't you ever seen those commercials for the LA county fair. It's sad to see all the LA wannabee hipster yuppies trying to be exotic or eclectic.

So upset with the hostess. We got there and the restaurant was empty. She sat us at the top left corner of the restaurant near the bar and I ask her if we could sit near the window or at least away from the bar. She replied back "Well were expecting a busy night and this is where I have you placed for the evening OK." I was so amazed by that I so wanted to get up leave but it was a friends birthday and I didn't want to disappoint them. Thank god our waiter was awesome and the food was excellent. I have posted pictures sooooooo yummy. Hostess/greeter you suck! (BTW be careful valet they crack my S550 key. So be sure to check your key before you hand it over and when you get it back.) Enjoy the Food is incredible.

My boyfriend and I really enjoy trying out new restaurants that we hear through the grapevine are "out of this world". So we narrowed down the list to (3) and decided on Animal. We went on a dreary, rainy, wet Saturday evening so their ongoing list of innovative and original comfort food selections were the perfect fit for the coziness we had been craving all day. We ended up sitting at the bar, as according to the bartender "they are booked weeks in advance." Unbeknownst to us, we were able to sit and enjoy a full-"service" meal at the bar, so it worked out in our favor. We usually prefer sitting at the bar anyway to get a more one on one relationship with the bartender. Boy, were we wrong... If you're the type of consumer that enjoys the fine-dining "experience", this surely is not the place for you. I personally enjoy spending my extra cash on nice restaurants with impeccable service. Animal, on the other hand, only got the food part right. We were barely greeted when we sat down by the bartender (Corey). My boyfriend asked for some beer suggestions (as we hadn't tried the majority of selections in the past) and he treated us like we were a huge inconvenience to him. He was very rude and very short. We then asked for some menu suggestions, in which his response was that everything was good and to choose a little bit of everything. Corey did not ask what we liked or what we were in the mood for. He barely even communicated we us the entire time. Our selections came out in the order they assumed would flow naturally. We had the lettuce/beet salad, which was tasty, but drowned in a creamy sumac dressing. Following, we shared the marrow bone, which was decent, but overly seasoned with chimichurri laid on top. I also prefer mine served with a french baguette, and this was served with Texas toast. Our final selection was the cavatelli, which was wonderfully seasoned, sweet, spicy and creamy all in one. Perfect for a rainy day. My boyfriend is a bacon die-hard (honestly, who isn't?) so we tried the bacon chocolate crunch bar which was too rich in taste for my liking. The dark chocolate was so overwhelming that you could barely taste the bacon that surrounded it. Not for me. Upon completion of our meal, we were neither asked if we needed anything else nor how we enjoyed the meal. Our server had no interaction with us whatsoever. In a nutshell, the food was very good. I would have loved to go back to sample the rest of the menu, as everything sounded amazing. Unfortunately, the service was horrific. It was definitely an experience that put a poor taste in my mouth. There are thousands of restaurants in LA and I would rather take my money and time to somewhere that appreciates both.

Are you kidding me?!?!  I died and went to heaven here!!!  Soooooo after many, many moons passing trying to get someone to go with me that isn't picky,  it happened!  My friend Austin and I made a trip down there last night.  We started off with the Burrata with tomatillo, very nice.  The Chicken liver toast, also very nice, the Sweetbreads...... A-MAZING!! I fell in love with the first bite!!!! That is a def must try!!  The bone marrow was tasty, but the pork belly sandwich with bbq glaze and slaw......... holy Sh*T IT WAS EPIC!!  Epic to the point of we order ANOTHER!!  That most delicious tid bit of artery clogging amazingness was incredible!  Ummm, what can I say, I am in love! It was an experience that I will be back for!!  DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!! Next was dessert which as a tres leche cake (graciously given to us by the most fantastic server!), and the Bacon Chocolate bar!  The tres leche was moist and delicious, not overly sweet.  YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!  The bacon chocolate bar, was also pretty amazing. MMMMM!  Honestly I want to go back today, but I would feel like such a crazed stalker!  I'll be back is all I can say! Do not miss out on this one, be brave and try something so amazingly gluttinous and EPIC!  Dooooo it!  You owe it to yourself! XOXOXO P.S. GET THE PORK BELLY!!!!!! GET THE PORK BELLY!!! GET IT! Thanks for your time! :-) Peace out cub scouts!

DEEEEEE LISH!!!! My friend and I had been talking about going there for months and finally made it last night. The name sort of freaked me out because though I love red meat I'm not a huge fan of pig- though I wouldn't throw a slice of crispy bacon out of my bed! But I thought- what better way to shame my family and delve into the fabulous world of pork then have my first open-to-anything experience at Animal on the first night of Hanukkah! OUR SERVER- Jeff- attractive, scruffy, young artist/Mountain Man type. He was SO well informed that you would think he was the chef. We asked countless questions and he had the answers to them all! He was lovely-  didn't give us ANY attitude over our menu interrogation. He also gave us his preferences and suggested a couple of ways to order- we decided to do a few apps and one entree- that did us well! APPS! We had the gnocchi, which was PERFECTLY cooked! I am not a fan of sage but the brown butter and sage sauce with tiny bits of sweet potato they were cooked in was DEELISH! Then we had the crispy pork belly with kimchi. Now- here is my disclaimer- I have NEVER had pork belly before and I am NOT Korean. Having said that- this was FANTASTIC! Anything with Crispy in the title is usually something that I will LOVE- this rule of thumb has not failed me thus far! Though not as crispy as I would have thought it seemed perfect to me. Sort of sweet, probably from the juicy fat under the beautifully browned and crispy top layer, and slightly savory. Can someone tell me- WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE BETTER THAN THAT?!! The kimchi was nontraditional, not like the ones that I've had before- more sweet and slightly tart. i think this was my favorite dish of the night. The last app we devoured was the baby halibut with radish, tarragon, pickled. . . something. . . and tiny chunks of tangerine. Though not spectacular, this dish actually worked really well for us. It was a small plate of sashimi and was refreshing and light after our first two plates. A great way to cleanse our palate before our entree. All the apps are relatively small- 3 was a perfect way to start considering we were sharing the one entree. ENTREE! We ordered the flat iron steak with a sauce made of Pabst Blue Ribbon. It was garnished with cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. Cooked perfectly! That's all I can say! The beer actually made the meat feel lighter- giving us PLENTY of room for dessert! DESSERT!  We had the tres leches cake. Again- new territory for me. First time- glad I took the plunge! This was fantastic! The whole cake was so light and smooth- not overly sweet like I thought it would be. All in all I loved ANIMAL! Supposedly they make big changes to the menu every 10 days or so- which means there will always be a reason to return! it's hard to find places in LA that keep food the star of the show. Without overpowering ambiance, snide servers, and music that's too loud to let you think, Animal keeps it's priorities in order and let's you know that the food is the main attraction.

We were heading over to the Fairfax area to catch a flick and thought we'd give Animal a run before the show.  What to say? The restaurant is a fairly narrow space, the decor of the restaurant clean and minimalist (bordering on stark but the space is saved by soothing lighting).  The bar seats 7  - 6 comfortably. As for the food, menu changes daily, though I'd say majority of items are like the famed character actors of Hollywood past.  We opted to try and keep things light, sharing 4 appetizers in lieu of a more traditionally structured meal (2 apps, 2 entrees) - here's a brief overview of what we ordered: -Crispy hominy, lime - scrumptious.  A seriously perfect warm up for the palate.  Corn nuts dream of being as tasty as the crispy hominy we gobbled down.  Great texture, seasoned just right...do yourself a solid and order this. -Lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac - arguably the best salad I've ever tasted.  We were a little skeptical about beets (they're always hit or miss) but I begged and pleaded for additional consideration.  This covered every corner of every taste bud I possess. -Baby broccoli, pancetta, parmesan, soft egg, bread crumbs - we read about it on the menu.  it seemed ambitious but, alas, it was too ambitious.  Flavor complexity is great but sometimes less is more; similarly, the savory was eclipsed by a number of different, competing flavor notes.  Skip this guy. -Melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread - this stoked our enthusiasm but the end-product was a little disappointing.  Very oily, very rich.  Expected chorizo crumbles but chorizo was thinly sliced like pepperoni.  Dish wasn't bland nor was it terribly flavorful.  It filled space in our stomachs - guess there's something to be said for that. I'd say give this place a shot if you're in the area - truthfully, the salad alone is worth the trip but judge for yourself. Good eating to you!

You know a restaurant is good when you're tempted to eat things that would otherwise make you vomit.  Such is Animal.  Went for my husband's birthday this weekend and tried bone marrow, pig ear, fried quail and then split the rib eye for two.  Everything was DELICIOUS and much more reasonably priced than we had anticipated.  The atmosphere is charming, it feels like a hip downtown Manhattan restaurant.  Can't wait to go back!!

Animal is an LA standout. A small restaurant with absolutely outstanding food. Pork belly sliders anyone? I have been to Animal a few times and always try to bring out-of-towners. Reasonably priced with a pretty good wine list, Animal is the gift that keeps on giving. And, they carry Preston wines which I'm a huge fan of and are hard to find in restaurants; two thumbs up! It is refreshing to find consistently great food in a hip location, with a good crowd, that isn't a "scene."

I took my wife to Animal for her birthday and it was probably the best  dining experience i've ever had and I have been to many places. Reason why: the menus is the best i could imagine. Pig ears with chili lime and a fried egg (break the yolk and mix it all around) was the shyet, pork belly sliders the bomb, chicken liver pate on toast, bone marrow with chimichurri is as good as it gets (slightly gelatinous but insane good),  and finally the poutine with oxtail gravy finished me off for the night. Not a pretentious joint, great music, and great selection of wines. I'm definitely coming back again. Animal is what A.O.C should be.

Came back to Animal with a few buddies for a guys night and we basically ordered the entire menu. It was awesome and disgusting at the same time since my stomach felt like it was going to explode when we left. - pork belly sliders: these were better than I remembered and the slaw was a nice flavor combination. - foie gras, biscuit, gravy: so rich but so amazing - basque, chorizo: super cheesy and a must have - chicken liver toast: really rich but great way to start the meal - grilled octopus: was okay, not my favorite but not bad - sweet breads: again, not a fan but weren't bad - rabbit loin: wrapped in bacon, super tender good - poutine: okay, it is fries with oxtail gravy. - loco moco: good but not worth the price. I prefer the foie biscuit - pig tails - very salty but nice and tender, decent dish - onion and tomato salad: nice and refreshing, good way to start the meal. - flat iron - super rich with the truffle fondue but the steak was cooked perfectly. I liked it but couldn't eat a whole one myself. - panna cotta: my buddies weren't a fan but I liked it. I planned on ordering the pound cake but misspoke and got the panna cotta. It was good but the pound cake is better.

Do you ever go to a restaurant and cheat entirely on your diet and regret it afterwords? Animal in West Hollywood is not a place you will regret. I may have eaten some incredibly fattening things that I would never eat anywhere else, but it was worth it. Animal is the brain child of 2 young, up and coming chefs: Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo It's a slightly hidden, unmarked, no ambiance kind of place. Plain wood walls, simple decor. Is it a secret? No. In fact, although my friend and I were able to walk in without a reservation (on a Tuesday at 7pm), we were asked if we could be out by 8:45 to accommodate existing reservations. I scoffed. An hour and 45 minutes for a quick dinner?! No problem. But now I understand the conundrum. We didn't want to leave. We wanted to keep eating. And at 8:45 we forced ourselves to leave, amidst the now full restaurant, amazing in Los Angeles at that time of the evening. Animal is not the place to go for an unadventurous eater. I fashion myself a run-of-the-mill Anthony Bourdain, but in reality, I was too shy to taste the sweetbreads or pig's tail. But I even convinced my friend to taste the foie gras because she saw me achieve new heights in near orgasmic bliss. Animal changes their menu daily, or at least, that's what the date on the top of the menu would insinuate. It's 1 page with starters, entrees, and desserts all on the 1 page. We created our own tasting menu, which is easy to do, considering each dish is somewhat small, yet very rich. We started with their green salad and foie gras appetizer. Even a green salad had something special about it. And the foie was beyond heaven. The sauce, the biscuit, the perfectly cooked foie and the balance of it all. I could swim in it. After that, we shared the gnocchi in pomodoro sauce. Little blissful clouds. I could eat a vat of them, but then we would have missed out on everything else. We progressed to the flat iron steak with Jerusalem artichokes. My favorite new vegetable. The steak was just a steak, but it had clean flavors and didn't disappoint. Were we ready for dessert? No. We decided to get the BBQ pork belly sandwiches. They look like 2 sliders of non-pulled pork. Dripping with yummy, tangy BBQ sauce. The perfect soft rolls, soaking up the liquid, the pork belly incredibly flavorful. Again, I wanted 10 more. Finally, we decided it best to move to dessert. I'd heard already about their chocolate bacon dish. I'll admit, it tasted exactly how I'd expected. A perfect blend of salty, smoky, sweet, and a dash of peppery. But my friend was in shock. She said it was the best thing she every ate. This was one of the best meals, ever. I want more. Much more. I want to try everything on the menu. And yes, it's worth cheating on your diet, just don't go too often.

This place is a great big ball of comfort. It's pricey but that happens sometimes, you kno? It's all worth it. The rack of ribs isn't even expensive for ribs. It costs me about $30 to make the same amount at home but there's are perfect. The poutine is possibly my favorite thing I've ever eaten. You're gonna spend a good amount to eat here but you do get what you pay for. If you can get there close to opening that's the best time to go. It gets loud and crowded on the quick.

Great food for all tastes. Obviously a meat lovers paradise but I went with a Vegi and we had shared a wonderful meal. I did sneak some pork sandos in (highly recommended) but the amber-jack was my favorite. Wonderful service too. It made us feel like we were back in SF.

Items we ordered: chicken liver toast grilled squid with chorizo and corn melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy balsamic pork ribs, succotash, herb butter chicken liver toast - chicken liver taste is very strong.  you must really love chicken liver, especially the after taste.  woah, not going to order that again. grilled squid chorizo - tasted a little like chinese food.  there was nothing great about this dish, no great flavors, just average. (grilled octopus at Osteria Mozza was 100% better) -melted petit basque, chorizo, grilled bread: was probably one of the best dishes of the night.  the cheese and hint of pepperoni and onions and the grilled bread, really tasted good and the bread complimented the cheese filling!   barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw - this dish was good but it was to saucy. the bbq sauce was oozing out and just had way to much sauce for that little sliders.  i let you be the judge. foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy - this dish we ordered twice because the first order we split 3 ways, but the piece of foie gras that i had was to small because i felt like the biscuit over powered the foie. So the second time i had it, the dish was good.  i really enjoyed the the gravy with the spicy sausage/chorizo, the hint of honey and the gravy and biscuits were good.  my only complain of this dish was the foie gras slices was too small but what i mean is the thickness was thin, too thin because it's get over cooked easily and i feel like they over cook some parts of my foie.   balsamic pork ribs, succotash, herb butter - what can i say about this dish that everyone else has already complimented on... well honestly this dish was all right, nothing special.  it was different because it had the balsamic glaze which made the ribs tasty.  but the ribs were moist and fall of the bones but i feel like they boil it, bake it, and the grill it... But honestly i feel like it was braised pork ribs, anyone can make these at home.  All you need is the balsamic glaze.   the ambience, what ambience... pretty boring place with white walls but if you like 80's music they play it all night but with one Biggie song.   conclusion would i go back: sure as long as i am not paying.  i want to try some other dishes my friends raved about but i felt like this restaurant was overhyped and it left me wanting more.  plus we our reservation was at 8:45pm, and we had to wait an extra 45 minutes to get our table.  What's the point of a reservation? But to make up for that they gave us free drink for our group.  $40 free drinks, not bad but still 45 minute wait... one of my favorite up n coming chefs is Eric Park.  He will out cook the 2 dudes any day of the week.  Carne Asada and Hot Red Sauce is the bomb!

Overrated!  I really wanted to love this place due to all the press and a few friend recommendations, but I didn't.  Maybe it was the plain jane decor or the boring service, but the ambiance is seriously nothing compared to many other high end LA restaurants.  BUT this place is rated based on the food?  Yes, the food is good and well flavored, but nothing I would hurry to come back for.  It reminds me of that restaurant that used to be by the Santa Monica airport where you could try all sorts of weird dishes (scorpion, brains, etc) and yet no real reason to come back.  Each menu item I had at Animal whether it was the marrow, the sliders, etc. were all heavily flavored to the point of it didn't matter what unique animal I was eating....I could be eating my own finger and it probably would taste yummy with so much garlic or BBQ sauce.    I'm not saying the place is bad, it's not, it's just overrated for what it is.

I heard about this place while watching the Food Network's The Best Thing I Ever Ate and wanted to try it out.  I know it seems pretty self explanatory but since it is called 'ANIMAL' this is probably not the best place to bring a vegetarian to.  Unfortunately, we didn't that when we went there.  Although we had dinner reservations, it took them FOREVER to seat us.  The service was mediocre and our vegan friend had to wait extra long for her gnoochi, which consisted of 5-6 small pieces on the plate.  The food was good, but for the prices, not so great.  I did try the dessert that was featured on the show (bacon chocolate crunch bar), which was okay.

You break my heart Animal. I've longed you for months, but you killed my spirit with your lack of lamb, savory-less dessert, and plates for ants (I thought it was another bad Mugatu joke). The appetizer list is extensive and the most interesting of the menu items. The quality was good--definitely rich and paired well--but it was bite-sized and dissatisfying. Yea apps are smaller, but I never expected a SINGLE ravioli to come out. Otherwise, the head cheese and sweet bread was unexpectedly good. It was the first time I had the latter, and I'm glad it was a good experience. As for the head cheese--I just love banh mi and pâté, so I will love this dish regardless. I had the following as my mains: foie gras loco moco, the flat iron steak, and the lamb. I thought the loco moco was the most original and unique. I really liked the maple syrup, teriyaki, and sriracha sauce they used in place of traditional plate gravy. The dish was topped by a fatty piece of foie gras, contrasted by a delicate fried quail egg. In accompaniment was also a (over-done) hamburger patty and spam (uhh yumm!). The flat iron was ordinary, though the size should have made it an appetizer. Now the lamb! I can't even talk about the lamb because I never got it after 45 minutes of waiting! You know really, it's fine if you don't have it, but please don't promise it to me, have me wait longer, and then end up canceling the order for me because somehow it's not available anymore. It's not that serious, just be honest! That kinda soured my experience, but it's fine because the much-anticipated bacon crunch bar is next on my palette. Well uhh.. yeah. Under-whelming. The bacon bits tasted like the fake bacon in cans used for salads. Maybe they played it too safe with this one--not wanting to interfere with the sweets--but if you're going to pull this stunt in the first place, balls out son! I preferred the tres leches--moist, milky, and adequate. I am glad I tried the place. Some plates were unique and well-executed... I just wouldn't come back. There are so many better restaurants at this price point.

i recently joined a foodies group where we pick a different restaurant to eat @ every other thursday and linda (our default leader) choose 1st and picked ANIMAL (grrr....) and man what a choice. dood, animal is a MUST eat and if you go there you MUST order: 1) the pork sliders 2) dulce leche dessert. we ordered a ton of other items... the pig ears, the kimchi pork, the marrow and foie gras spam burger (haha yah, and it works!) and et cetera... and it was ALL good - but the 2 listed above stood out amongst everyone. i mean everything was awesome - the hostess was awesome, the server was cool, the food came out at the rt time... the ONLY problem was the table next to me were all these girls and every now and then i would glance over and some of them were chomping away with their mouths open... i noticed that a lot with my asian friends - they eat with their mouths open... anyway i can't the restaurant for the cultural idiosyncrasies of another ethnicity - haha. btw this place is NOT cheap... but rarely is fine dining ever cheap... unless you go to IN n Out hahah

this started off as an attempted trip to golden state, which was closed. but after a challenging parking experience (my friend's exotic trophy car requires a very specific parking situation), we decided to stay in the neighborhood and give animal a try. we got in with no reservation and everyone was welcoming. my friend and i threw caution to the wind and asked our server to order our first courses. we wound up with the hamachi (herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, crispy shallot and a nice, bright jalapeño kick) and the grilled king crab with tabasco butter. really really solid choices, ms. server! the hamachi was served on a tostada. it tasted fresh and the fish sauce/shallot mixture gave a southeast asian inflection to the experience. while i couldn't help but think that we could have gotten 75% of the way there for $2.50 with a ceviche tostada somewhere, this was truly a memorable dish. like your mom. and the king crab...oy the king crab. the chef had taken the liberty of cracking the shells for us to facilitate knife and fork (as opposed to fingers, hands and feet) dining. nice move. tabasco butter! why hadn't anyone told me about this before? i'm going to carry some of it in an amulet around my neck from now on. finally, we split the flat iron steak (artichoke hash, truffle parmesan fondue) and the bbq pork belly sliders. mmm. across the board. the steak was a perfect medium rare, with a nicely seared crust and the sliders slid gracefully into my belly. nice plump buns and a tangy, savory sauce. (yup, i said it) we washed everything down with a few bottled beers and were too full for any sweets afterwards. so i'll be back to try some of the other goodies pretty much immediately. thanks, animal.

Argh! Pork Belly is AMAZING! but the place was crowded, and there wasn't much seating. Still, we had an amazing time... loved the set up but it was also very loud for how few people could fit. It was a great experience all in all... I would go for a fun time and to try something new but its not good for the dateing scene. Make sure you are willing to eat! This place isn't for your vegan or "I don't like sushi" type person... because here you don't just eat the burger, you eat the whole cow. Expect to see some liver, tongue, etc as a regular on the menu. But TRY IT! IT is sooooo good!

When writing my last review I noticed a lot of people mentioned the dulce de leche tres leches. I made an immediate return trip to Animal and made sure I had room for this dessert. The tres leches was so good, we stopped the waitress and ordered another one that we could take home with us. Even though it was after closing at this point they gladly packed up another piece for us, which we quickly devoured when we returned home. Animal rules.

FINALLY got to try this place. came here last night with a girlfriend for a long overdue dinner date. we didnt have a reservation, and there werent any tables available, but the bar was open with the full menu, so we took a seat there. the interior is cozy, pretty small, but i like it..it has a warm vibe. i had a mamas lil yella pils beer, which was pretty good, and served with the cutest little glass ever.. haha so heres what we ordered: Chicken liver toast Balsamic glazed pork ribs Pork Belly Sliders Marrow bone Chicken liver toast came out first, and it loooked really cute. but i couldnt eat it.. i dont know why, but something about the texture and flavor had a gross factor to me...so i gave my half to my friend..who deliciously ate it all. she loved it... then came the balsamic glazed pork ribs about 5 pieces. this. was. my. favorite. dish. here. or even the best ribs ive had so far! they were tangy, sweet, and the meat fell off the bone with the touch of my fork. SO tender and juicy and flavorful! then came the bone barrow, with a side of thickcute buttery toast. the bone marrow was topped with a green chimichurri like sauce which was SO good and SO decadent...i relaly really like the toast that it came with...YUM then finally our pork belly sliders came, and i was SO full by this point, i only managed to get one bite of the slider and stuff it into my belly...but that one bite was reallly good, fatty, delisioucnessss.. overall, the food that we ordered was pretty heavy, and with my beer comsumption i was SO stuffed, i barely had room to breatheeeee. i took the once-bitten slider home and took it to the bf who devoured it on the spot. haha our total came out to $50 pretip. and i think it was well worth it!

this past weekend came here without reservations and tried to take over the bar in company of 4, we had the following: appetizers: hominy - looks like popcorn chicken the size of small corn, but much more crunchable in the mouth like a tetrapak vs an aluminum can but with a unique taste thanks to the batter and lime; ask for more lime limey ! the first time i had hominy was in pozole. this is nothing like it, but the texture of it is, its the inside that counts, maybe you can peel it like a grape. ricotta cheese something in some tomato sauce - this was something i would not order again. although it tasted good, it was nothing extra-ordinary and thus worthy of gracing the space above which my taste buds worship in my mouth. head of cheese- was there a head of cheese? what is a head of cheese? does it think? i think it came with meet of some sort and i couldnt find the head. anyway, this was something i would give a 6-7 on a 10 scale. probably would pass next time amberjack - this was good. was debating between this and the halibut. this definitely has some indian influences and was very good. the proportion of fish would be enough to fill about 4 tablespoons for you bakers out there. Entrees: foie gras - well this was my first time, and i didnt know what to expect really so to be fair i would really have to try it again for comparison somewhere else. however, i thought it was Aye oh kay. here goosey goosey to woo the geese is what they do in NY now since PETA. quail- almost like KFC, but KFC tastes better and is cheaper. it really does. taste test? night and day.  skip this and drop the almost 40 into the piggy bank for a rainy day; think about this -  you can buy almost 37 x 5 chicken mcnuggets at mcdonalds. the good thing about this dish was the grits, which were excellent. the steak dish... now poo on me. but i forgot the name of the steak entree but omfg.  you think that ruths kris is good? ha yeah right. aside from my fantastic bbq that will essentially blow up your tongue and render it senseless i can gladly say, this was the best steak I have ever had in a restaurant. the meat had overtones of butter (was it soaked?) and the seasoning was perfect and the potatoes it came with were excellent, but could use some bigger proportions. i like 1:4 proportion meat to carb, theirs was more 1:1 so overall, best meal all year since i usually stay away from fancy smancy restraunts.  id come again, if money aint a thang like the song for me, maybe starting next summer! ;)

firstly, LOVED the decor! it was simple and clean. no banner for their name -- which reminded me of CHIKALICIOUS in nyc (dessert bar) so i immediately liked animal. (biased i know) dishes: HAMACHI TOSTADA: herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut. LAMB MEATBALLS: gold rice, green garbanzos, creme fraiche. BBQ PORK BELLY SANWICHES: slaw. PIG EAR: chili, lime, fried egg. desserts: BACON CHOCOLATE CRUNCH BAR. PANNA COTTA, cherries. TRES LECHES, DULCE DE LECHE. most of the things we ordered were delicious. (the pig's ear was a little too sour) my favorite out of the ones i've tried so far is the lamb meatballs. it wasn't chewy at all-- which is not what you would expect from a meatball. most beef or turkey meatballs are a little chewy. the lamb one was so soft. the rice and sauce was so good too. the panna cotta was sooooooo good. it was light and not too sweet. of course everything else was good as well but the panna cotta was my favorite. the bacon chocolate bar was alright-- but my two friends LOVED it. im not  a fan of chocolate so that's probably why i didnt think it was amazing. the salty flavor of the bacon worked well with the sweetness of chocolate. good mix for sure. the portions, i would have to admit, are a little small. but three girls shared four appetizers and three desserts and i was definitely satisfied! definitely! we ended up paying about $30 each but it was fun and the food was good. not the best restuarant i've been to but definitely one of the better ones. it reminded me a lot of nyc ones. ^^ love love love. also! it opens at 6pm but it quickly gets filled really fast. it must be really known. o_0 hehe.

To be fair, I went in with high expectations.  I went with my husband for his birthday, and he seemed to like it.  My experience was just okay, I probably wouldn't go back again.  First, the service was sub-par, and I'm not picky about service.  Our waiter did not even come to take our drink order until AFTER we finished the first two of six dishes, and showed up at our table basically once more to give us our bill.   As for food, we started with the hamachi tostada (very good and a complex dish) and the rabbit/sausage spring rolls (nothing special but tasted fine).  Moved onto the chicken liver toast (really yummy) and the veal sweetbreads (gross...overly breaded, no flavor to the sweetbreads at all...major disappointment).  I normally love sweetbreads but I was almost willing to just toss these.  Next we got the pork belly sliders (pork belly was delicious and perfectly cooked, with a great fresh bun, but they were WAY too saucy which detracted from the dish and was so messy I had to wash my hands afterward).  If those had very little sauce they would have been a much better dish.  Finally, got the foie gras loco moco.  My husband liked this a lot, but I had like two bites and was just grossed out. The gravy was sweet, which was completely at odds with the dish.  It also had short grain rice, which soaked up all the sweet watery gravy like a sponge, ick.  The foie gras was very nicely cooked, it just couldn't make up for the rest of it.   In any event, I'm glad my husband was happy, but I very likely won't be going back.

Quite good.  They do a good job with an eclectic menu that includes 'parts' from both land and sea.  It's a great opportunity to eat parts of the animal most of us (in the coastal U.S.) don't experience often if ever. Their combinations tend to favor bold flavors whether in the use of spices, heat, or acid, but nothing we had was out of balance.  IMO only the pig ear dish didn't show enough of the main ingredient's flavor. The wine list available by the glass or carafe is interesting.  They feature varietals, styles, and regions that many will be unfamiliar with, but this seems done not simply for the sake of being different, but to present food friendly wines that work with items on the Animal menu.  For example, the '06 Savennières (with a long finish) went perfectly with the (oh so tender) octopus and chorizo dish. The place is  loud, but it wasn't ear splitting.  Service was attentive.

I'm usually stingy with my stars but I am throwing them at Animal not for the Quail entree (amazing grits and spinach), not for the polite attentive service or great wine recs but for the show stopping- "you had me at hello!" fava bean appetizer. I always knew you were out there somewhere, and now at last I've found you. You are not complex- made up of a handful of ingredients: fresh sea salt, farmer's market fava beans, fresh Parmesan and freshly baked bread.  But yet, you complete me.

This isn't fine dining. If you remember that going in, Animal is a great restaurant. There was dirt under the waiter's fingernails. That grossed me out. Lucky for us, he wasn't serving the food, just the attitude. This is definitely a saturated fat-heavy place, in an unapologetic, two-stoner-dudes-can-make-food kinda way. There is a lack of follow-through on some dishes. Our sweetbreads were undercooked on the inside and uncrispy on the outside. The salad accompanying the ribs was dismal, and I'm being kind. I felt sick after eating. That said, everything was incredibly tasty in a noveau riche decadent kind of way. It's one thing to be unapologetically carnivorous; it's another to lack balance. Do no valet. Just don't do it. It was a half hour wait because there is only one guy doing everything.

I was really excited for thier signature dessert the bacon chocolate bar, I feel it was a bit over hyped on the food net work. I would suggest the tres leches over the bacon bar. I love foie gras yet I couldnt tell that there was any maple syrup in the dish. I also ordered a rib eye special that was for two priced at 85 dollors and was way more then worth the price it almost feed our table of 6 at 38 oz of meat with escargo on top. I would recommend getting there a little early since it is hard to find. Reservation is your best bet of getting a table small and intimate room.

So we're on our way to Pantages to see Wicked and its around 6pm.  Looking for a place to find we go through all of our options on the way and near the theatre.  We were going to Balcones de Peru when pork fat jumped into my head, as it often has a habit of doing.  Thank goodness I'm not Muslim and not Kosher (no offense meant) because I could not live without swine.  Seriously.  So we walk into Animal and we're the only people in the entire restaurant.  What a way to eat.  I gotta start going out to dinner at 6pm more often.  The waiter we had was awesome, I'm sure because they weren't very busy,  We received excellent recommendations and he allowed us to taste some of the wines before ordered.  Three of the best dishes I've had in a very long time and maybe ever.  I would come back here again and again just to have these dishes.   1. Petit Basque with salami and onions served on cripsy warm bread.  Trust me this is sinful.  The perfect flavor combinations and textures.  I burnt the top of my mouth on the first bite then went right back in for the 2nd bite.  We decided the next time we go back we need to order 1 petit basque per person.  Animals. 2. Ribs with heirloom totatoe and bread salad.  My GF doesn't particularly like BBQ sauce or ribs.  By the end of the meal she was licking her fingers. The ribs had a crust on the outside and were perfectly sauced and tender.  Finger freaking licking good.  Damn, 3. Nectarine and blueberry crisp.  If you think Cynthia's had a good cobbler you need to try this.  I know they are technically different types of desserts but similar enough.  The nectarines and blueberry worked so well with the crisp and creme fraiche.  Perfect dessert to end the meal and not too sweet. The other dishes we had were good, leeks with bacon and turbot with artichoke and fava beans.  The turbot was cooked very elegently, nice filet of fish.  The problem was that compared to these 3 dishes they did not really make a lasting impression.  Since we came early it wasn't noisy like others had to deal with.  I like the fact the wine list was short succinct and very reasonably priced.  The service was great and I need to go back to try the chocolate bacon dessert.  One of the best meals I've had in a long time.  Read my reviews, I go out a lot so that's saying something.

SO GOOD! I made reservations and thank goodness I did, there was a huge line outside. I parked on the street by the high school. We ordered: - petit basque: wow. amazing. thin slices of chorizo, green onions, onions and basque baked so it's melted and oozing everywhere. I don't even like cheese that much, but this was pretty mild - pork belly and kimchi: surprisingly light. I'm not a big fan of pork belly, but this was also amazing. Perfectly crisp fat and really really tender meat. - skirt steak, parmesan fondue and artichoke hash: I wish this was a bigger portion because I split it with my friend and I still wanted more. I've never had skirt steak so good. And the sauce was ammmaazzzinnngggg. - bacon chocolate crunch bar: heavenly. dark? chocolate ganache, crispy rice and BACON. there was something smokey about one of the non-bacon layers- I "had" to eat the whole thing because my friend didn't like it. A bit roo rich for just one person so share! - brown butter tart: YUM, not too sweet or bland. good way to end a heavy meal. All that food and $40ish per person with tax/tip!. freaking amazing. I'm going to go back and try the pig ear, which everyone (according to the server and yelp) loves.

it's a relatively small place and very discreet-- we completely drove past it at first. park at a meter if you find one; there was plenty of parking when we went on a thursday night at 8pm. we had a reservation which i think is a good idea if you're planning on going during a weekend. the service was great. our server was friendly and she even took pictures of us since it was my friends bday. she also refilled our waters a million times and we never had to ask. now for the food...drumroll please... my friend ordered the pig ear and it sounded quite sketchy i must admit but it actually just tasted like spicy bacon as every foreign meat product usually tends to do. it comes with complain cause the more food, the merrier. i ordered the ricotta & goat cheese gnocchi. it was really yummy. i also ordered the pork belly sandwiches which i highly recommend. they're also more filling than some of the other menu items. then came the chocolate bacon bar! i was disturbed by the combination in theory but it was actually half decent. but my other friends ordered the tres leches and that was AMAZING! all in all, i'm sold and i'll head back to this spot when i have more than a few bills to spend on food.

My sister celebrated her 21st birthday here back in September. She made a reservation for 9 pm and all 8 of us arrived within 10 minutes of that time. We were told that the table was almost ready, but they were just waiting for a group of guests (that had been there since 6 pm) to leave. So we stood outside and waited.. when we caught the hostess' eye, all she could do was smile and shrug. After 40 minutes, she finally approached the group. We were seated at 9:50 and to save time, we basically ordered one of everything on the menu (well, almost everything... 15 items). We ordered (to share): Arugula, apple, grapes, pine nuts - kind of boring, but I guess people don't come here to eat salad... Lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta... - this salad was good, but not that special; I did like that there was a good amount of cheese on it (not so much that it's all you can taste) Pig tail croquettes, pickled onion aioli - it's decent Pig ear, chili, lime, fried egg - the flavors were okay, but it was on the spicier and drier side Ricotta and goat cheese gnocchi - nothing that exciting Sweetbreads, creamed spinach, capers, hen... - I love sweetbreads! And everything else about this dish! Pork belly, kimchi, peanuts, chili soy, scallion - I like pork belly, but not served like this... The chili was very overpowering Duck confit, pickled cherry, orange, fennel - eh, it was good, great Amberjack, yellow peach, citrus, mint, chili - very flavorful... the amberjack was perfect and all the flavors were so good- one of my favorites! Smoked trout, avocado, poblano corn vinaigrette - this was amazing as well - I think their fish dishes were better than the meat ones Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar... - yumm... I love meat and gravy and cheese and fries and this was just so warm and filling Leg of lamb, merguez, salsa verde... - I'm running out of ways to say that something was pretty good but not amazing Flat iron, artichoke hash, truffle parmesan... This was really good Quail fry, grits, chard, slab bacon... - Quail was okay. The bacon was yummy, but when is bacon not good? I could probably have been more specific but I ate there a couple months ago and it's been awhile.. Oops. Also their menu changes daily, so not all these items may still be on the menu... Overall, I was pretty happy with the food, because while not every dish was outstanding, there were enough good ones to compensate for that. And maybe I should have read yelp reviews beforehand, so I could order just the menu items that are outstanding. The dishes arrived really slowly, about one dish every 7-8 minutes, because the kitchen is pretty small. I feel like the waitresses did attempt to try to speed things up because they seated us so late... but we didn't leave until almost 12, which for my just-turned-21 sister sucked (less time to drink?). The bill for 8 people (after an automatic 18% gratuity) was almost $300.

I have eaten in a lot of restaurants all over the United States and abroad. In terms of food, inventiveness (sp?) and flavors, this is at the top of my list. Its BYOB, but they have a phenomenal wine list. I went with  my family and literally ordered everything but 3 items on the menu. The food is beyond decadent and rich. I can't even recommend a dish bc there's nothing on the menu that's below a 28 ZAGATs in my opinion.

My bf had wanted to come here for ages.  It's very hard to get reservations here nowadays, a week ahead got us a table for 4 at 10pm on a Saturday.  The service was delightful, super friendly and accommodating.  It's definitely lots of carnivorous fare, heavy fatty foods, and lots of indulgent melt in your mouth flavors.  Nevertheless, I loved it, ate a ton, and felt like a fat ass.  The biscuits and foie gras are to die for, literally.  If you like food, you will like animal.

Came here after a filling and satisfying dinner and dessert at AOC just for the panna cotta with saba. The only clue that identifies the restaurant are the occupied tables, even at 11pm on a weeknight. Although we didn't have a reservation, the hostess was gracious about finding us a table as soon as possible and remained gracious even after we told her that were just there for dessert (and just one dessert at that). It was definitely worth it to try the creamy, perfectly textured creation, although my friend and i couldn't finish it. That probably means we shouldn't be so gluttonous next time, but you live and learn!

Foie Gras!!!!  This place is all about Foie Gras~  The foie gras with the biscuits were so tasty.  Chicken liver toast was Superb!!  Also it's only 3 bucks!  I also love the pork belly slider and the bacon with chocolate dessert.  Marrow Bone was pretty good too.  My least favorite were the pig ears and the hamachi. The pig ears were too spicy. I don't think i would order these two again when i visit next time.

I love this place. I love how they try to make it the heartiest meal you've had in your life. Or how they try to use every part of the cow/pig/lamb/etc. in every one of their dishes. They have no mercy for animals here and you don't care too much because it's so good and you wonder what else they can make for you to put in your mouth. Their fries are delicious and savory and the panna cotta is to die for. I recommend coming here with a group of friends so you can try everything because ordering just one dish or two would not do this place any justice.

Amazing meal! Basically imagine how ur face is getting slapped by the softness of fat and the thrilling of cholesterol.. It hurts but some (or most) people will ask for more. Chimicuri bone marrow (def most unique one), foie gras loco moco, crispy pig head, flat iron with truffle parmesan fondue, chicken liver toast, halibut tostada. You should def order all of this.. The flatiron taste a bit of expected.. But the rest.. Of course u cant miss the bacon chocolate! (it was okay.. Combination of sweet and salty dressed in chocolate). This place is indeed a different kind of animal!

Wow.  Animal really lives up to the hype!  It's pretty small, and even with a reservation you may have to wait at the bar while people finish up their desserts.  However, the wait is very much worth it. We had the quail fry, melted petite basque, and pork belly appetizers.  All delicious, but the pork belly with kimchi and quail fry are definitely the stand-outs.  The kimchi is well seasoned with the right spice and the pork is very tender and flavorful.  The quail is perfectly complimented by the slab bacon and the greens are cooked to perfection.  My dining partners and I ordered the pork ribs, duck breast, and branzino.  The duck breast is definitely the lightest dish, but tender and the butternut squash mash is absolutely delicious.  The ribs are so tender, they fall off the bone when you cut into them.  My partner remarked that the ribs are as good as they can get outside of Texas.  The branzino, oh my, I don't even have words.  Well-cooked, crispy on the outside but absolutely tender and white on the inside.  Ok, can you tell I loved my dinner here?!?  Holy shite, I haven't even told you about the dessert!   We had the doughnuts and the tres leches cake.  Unfortunately the tres leches was a bit underwhelming (I am Mexican, and I have high standards), but the doughnuts are flipping delicious.  Fluffy, fried balls of goodness, rolled in cinnamon sugar and drenched in caramel sauce.  OMFG, D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S.  I think I've met my dessert match...I am still savoring those doughnuts,  Yum, yum. I rarely enjoy hyped-up restaurants, but Animal actually delivers on its delectable promise.  Oh, and I also got to see Rebecca Gayheart (Dylan's wife on 90210 or the Noxema Girl) and Eric Dane (McSteamy, is that what they call him?).  Nothing beats a good dinner and a minor celebrity sighting!

everything that needs to be said about this place has been said.  i'm just checking in to give Animal the four stars it deserves.   i'm docking one star because the space is not as comfortable as it could be.  other than that, Animal was incredible.  they have a way of making something ordinary (i.e. french fries) into something extraordinary, which i completely appreciate.   it's your every day comfort food with a unique, exquisite twist.

Animal has perfected the art of making offal tasty.  We ordered the poutine, barbeque pork belly sandwiches and an arugula salad, just to balance all the meat.  While the pork belly sandwiches and salad were delicious, the most memorable dish was the poutine.  It was french fries, oxtail gravy, cheddar and beef cooked in a casserole, the ultimate comfort food dish on a cold or rainy day in L.A (which was not the case when we were there and typically rare in sunny L.A. ).   The service was excellent- our server knew the food and made great recommendations. This will be another go to place for me when I'm down in LA LA land.

everything we ordered was amazing.  well, dessert was a little lackluster, but all of the savory dishes were fantastic. pig's ear with lime, chilis and fried egg. head cheese. grilled octopus with white beans. bacon wrapped rabbit loin. oxtail poutine with 10 year aged vermont cheddar. foie gras loco moco. everything was perfect.  I went in a group of 5 so we each got a couple bites of everything, and that was just enough.  i loved being able to try things and stlil sort of want a bit more.   for dessert, we had the pound cake with macerated strawberries, and the apricot peach pie.  both were pretty good but nothing to write home about.   we also managed to find a great, reasonably priced bottle of wine that went really well with our dinner.   I'd love to go back to animal.  my only complaint though is that it's really loud in there.  i suppose that's to keep things edgy and interesting, but if i can't hear what people at my table are saying, and there are only five of us, i think that's a problem.   i'm really eager to go back.  it's a meal to rave about.

I don't remember the exact dishes we ordered, but they were all to par with my expectations...my favorites includes a maple fois gras (did I spell that right?) and the bacon chocolate bar at the end was a fun treat, with the bacon notes being extremly subtle :)...we also had an oxtail with gravy over fries, kind of a classy version of chili cheese fries minus the cheese...from the looks of everyone around us the food looks good no matter what you get, an the service is on par with any fine dining experience you'd hope to have...make reservation, and make sure you don't miss it (literally, as of this writing there is no sign out front...it is slightly north of canters on the west side of fairfax...)

I have been here twice.  The first time I came, I was not a fan.  The food was mediocre and I the dessert I came for (bacon chocolate bar) was not what I had imagined.  However, I came back again (somewhat reluctantly) but boy was I glad I did!  I came a few months ago so I don't remember everything I ordered, but the pork belly sliders were AMAZINGGGG.  I ordered the baby back ribs (the portions were HUGE!) it was more than enough for two.  Someone else also ordered steak which was actually even better than the ribs.  For dessert, we got the bacon chocolate bar again (I think I've come to accept that fact that while I love both separately but together, not so much).  BUT the chocolate pudding in a jar was SOOO GOOD!  Granted it's like $6 for some pudding, but it was really really good.  Good thing I came back or else I would have never realized how good Animal could be!

this place is really hard to find, because its a small place on the street, the facade of the bldg blends in with all the other bldgs on the street! but i love this restaurant because it has every possible meat. and its ONLY meat. they are really creative with their menus. you have to make reservations 5 days in advance cause they are super packed. it is very pricey but its totally worth it! the only bad thing is that the seating and atmopshere is pretty plane and ordinary. i wish they can do something with the interior. its packed. even at... 11pm for dinner.  people can listen to your converstaions cause the tables are pretty close. the people that work there seem happy.   5 stars for meat. yay!!!!!

Decided to go here because I needed to get my meat fix and because it was after midnight.  Gotta love those Fridays in Lent!  I'm probably gonna say what every other previous reviewer has said about the pork belly sliders.  These were pretty damn good.  Nice amount of crunch when you bite into them and they just melt in your mouth as you eat them.  I wanted to have more but did not want to pass out on the drive home (it was after midnight).  Also tried the melted petit basque (w/chorizo and grilled bread), the broccoli dish (with pancetta, soft egg, etc.), foie gras w/ biscuit, and the chocolate bacon bar.  All dishes were very good.  Very innovative spin on traditional bar food.  Service was good and I liked the fact that it wasn't too busy and that they open until 2 AM.  Will likely be back in the future!

I found this place to be quite pretentious, the food very mediocre and the pairings odd.  I feel like they're trying to accomplish something that maybe they're falling flat on. That being said, they are critically acclaimed chefs so they can't be doing something completely wrong... but I think it's definitely an attempt at their own form of molecular gastronomy and taking cues from other famous chefs in an attempt to be "different" without actually being different. I went in specifically to try the bacon crunch bar and didn't even finish it. Disappointing experience on the whole.

Animal has become my favorite restaurant in LA. They put a creative culinary spin on Southern dishes. My favorite dishes are the pork belly sliders and the hamachi tostada. The hamachi is the most heavenly thing. I frequently get cravings for both of these items. I'm also a huge fan of the lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac. Such a wonderful salad with so many great complimentary flavors and textures. As for the dessert, the panna cotta is delicious and very light. The food is never mediocre (which seems to be the theme in LA). I'm quite fond of the Pinot Noir and the Malbec that they serve. The service is great, the food is decadent and tasty. The place has become quite the hit (and it is a pretty small restaurant), so make sure to call ahead and make a reservation a day in advance!

Four stars for service, 3 for food. Maybe it was because I wasn't very hungry, but even then, the food still should've reached my expectations. The ratings hyped this place up quite a bit. We had the bone marrow with chimichurri, bbq pork sliders w slaw, balsamic vinegar pork ribs, and crispy rabbit legs w lemon aioli, and the chocolate bacon bar w/ salt + pepper ice cream. The rabbits were delish!! Bone marrow + chimichurri = GENIUS. The bbq pork sliders were a bit too fatty for me although YES, I KNOW, pork belly IS supposed to be fatty. It just didn't do it for me, however. The bbq sauce was goood though. The balsamic vinegar pork ribs were nothing special. The meat fell off the bone as soon as I stuck my fork in it, which, for you rib connoisseurs (LOL) is not a sign of a good rib. Sauce was bleh. Service was good though and the food arrived QUICKLY. As soon as we were done with one dish, our old dishes were whisked away and replaced with brand new ones, along with our meal. The waiter didn't check on us at all, but the man replacing our dishes did. The hostesses were nice as well. Hopefully next time I come back to try new dishes, I'll be more impressed. Overall my favorite dishes were the rabbit legs, bone marrow, and salt+pepper ice cream. Mmmmmm!

Went here for dinner last night.  It was fantastic.  We tried 4 dishes and we were pretty stuffed.  We got the ribs, the pork belly slider, foie gras biscut, and a salad.  The pork belly slider was fantastic.  The bread, the meat, the cabbage and the sauce were in perfect harmony.  Some say the sauce was too overpowering but to my palate that was not the case.  Next time I go again I'll be sure to order the sliders again.

Went Saturday with a couple of my buddies.  Man where to start.  We ordered about 8-9 different items and a few duplicates.  I am not a fan of 7 to 8 dishes of super rich in flavor food but they had 4 or 5 that hit the spot.  Order of my favorites to least - pork belly sliders - This thing was so perfect its hard to describe.  Maybe it was the fact that it was like eating melted butter/bacon/ fat with barbecue sauce and enough acid from the cole slaw to not make it too rich.  I could have had 4 or 5. - loco moco - Wow layers and layers of flavor.  Each individual piece was really good.  Spam was awesome, hamburger patty was really good and the foie gras.  Wow.  They really know how to cook Foie gras here, one of the best cooked foie gras i've ever had.  I think its because they cook a hundred order of them a night.. - foie gras, biscuit, gravy - the richest item of the night.  Foie gras with a sweet maple gravy?  dont remember what it was, but the biscuit had a nice texture to the dish -Chicken Liver Toast - I love pate.  This was just a really good pate.  The best meals i've ever had have always started with pate.  I see a pattern here. - basque, chorizo - id describe it as a gourmet queso fundido - flat iron - A well cooked piece of meat with truffles.  I personally like truffles and it had a good amount of truffles to it, not overpowering - grilled octopus - you can't go wrong with grilled octopus - sweet breads - Can't go wrong with sweet breads.  Really well cooked, a little salty for me - rabbit loin - Well cooked meat, juicy. - poutine - It was good, nothing special.   - pig tails - I found this dish to be really salty, but everyone else at the table thought it was good. well the items i described the most had a lasting impressions on me and they were excellent.  It was a really good meal, like any place with 9-10 dishes there are some great dishes and some ok dishes. Would like to go again, and somehow steal the pork belly sliders recipe, maybe its in their book

The place isn't special at all.  On the plus side, the wine list is ok and very affordable (apparently it changes often).  The food is competently prepared but not inspired. I typically like this sort of minimal decor, but I don't understand why the lighting was so bright...a little mood please.  At this price point, I expect more.

I'm giving this an average review because admittedly, I'm not a foodie, and even worse, I don't eat pork. I came here with friends, and was starving, so I pretty much cried when I realized 98% of the menu was just one animal: ze piggy. We ordered a mishmash of stuff: a salad that was decent, french fries in oxtail and cheese that were probably the highlight, and some other stuff I would never try because goose intestine just isn't my thing. The main course, a tri tip, was FAR too rare for me and bleeding all over the place despite me ordering it medium, but I know that means I'm not a proper carnivore. We had a bottle of wine that was pretty good and reasonably priced. Overall, I got the impression I was paying more for the 'privilege' of being surrounded by L.A A-listers and watching Seth Rogen eat dinner than for the actual servings. I'm not kidding, there was a woman with shoulder pads who looked like she escaped from either Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead or Working Girl. Most of the people eating there don't look like they eat food. But the one thing that made this really unpleasant was our aggressive, obnoxious server. First, he was WAY too pushy from the moment we sat down. Yeah, we're nobodies but does that mean we have to eat and gtfo on a sunday when the place is half empty at 930 pm? He would literally walk about three feet away and give us ten seconds when we told him we needed time. Awful. And he was extremely condescending when I asked him questions about the food. On the other hand, the hostess was extremely nice.

quite possibly one of my favorite restaurants of all time! yes, it's on Fairfax where you couldn't find parking if your life depended on it. but hey, it's LA and i didn't expect much less. i have to say that the main reason i love this place isn't because of the food (that's a close second). but the space and menu options are so unique (it changes EVERY DAY...how do they do that??) and minimalistic (check out the menu!)  that i find the place the most charming place i've ever been to! if you LOVE meat (animal...get it?) and love a little touch of exclusivity (you have to make reservations way in advance...don't expect to get in on a walk-in)...then come here. HANDS DOWN i ran into a couple of friends who recommended the cheese fondue. WOW, best thing i've had in my life. check out their menu for the daily dish: http://animalmenu.wordpr…

as much as id like to have a chance to rip a trendy LA spot i cant. this place is doing it right...service was great the decor was simple yet elegant and a lot of thought was in the menu. carrot salad with avacodo and  (i think) tarragon salad was very light fresh and tasty. pork belly sandwhiches with slaw was amazing. Also had the fried rabbit legs with meyer lemon aoli and radishes...which was VERY good althought the rabbit was a bit dry, heck ive never cooked rabbit so maybe thats just how it is....we also had the flat iron steak with sunchokes which  i love and that was done to near perfection. i really want to pick up the cookbook too "two guys one pan". our server was great, very attentive and friendly and gave us great recommendations. beer and wine list also were solid.

I. Love. This. Place. So I'm a little bit of a softy for this place. My husband and I were lucky enough to have the owners of this place cater our wedding. Seriously, the BEST food i have ever had period, let alone at a wedding! Some of my guests are still talking about the mini Kobe beef burgers, the pork tacos, and the lamb chops! So for our one year anniversary, we went to Animal to celebrate. My in-laws actually came to visit us on our anniversary(They weren't trying to spend our anny with us, it just happened to be the same weekend as my father-in-law's spring break...he's a teacher) Animal is a little pricey for us, so I gladly spent my 1st anny with the in-laws when they said they would pay for dinner at Animal! So we started off with 4 appetizers and shared them all. (1. crispy hominy - never had it before, SO GOOD! but if you can't just try everything like we did..i'd go for something a little more. 2. Melted petit basque - they had me at melted! 3. some king crab toast thing... possibly the best crab I've ever had. 4. Poutin(sp) french fries with deliciousness gravy or something). Then we got 4 entrees and shared them. we got the lamb shank, a steak of some sort, fish of some sort, and fried quail. OMG all so good!!! Then we got their bacon, chocolate bar thing for dessert(it's been shown on the food network a couple of times)... holy cow, I could eat it everyday! I know I'm not really describing the food that well, but just trust me, it's the best food ever! I have now had their food twice in my life, and i think i would pretty much eat dog poop if they served it to me and gave it a fancy name. I think even more so than the food, I just really enjoyed the whole experience. The staff are all so nice and so helpful...they know they are serving uncommon things like bone marrow, so they will take the time to explain some stuff to you if you need. We tried like 4 different wines throughout the meal, and our server was very helpful there as well. The place is super cozy and intimate too, which i always like. Sorry i know i jumped around a bit here, I just LOVE this place! You have to eat there at least once!

Animal is so cool, it doesn't even have a sign out front.  Seriously.  I'm not saying it's overly hip or anything, just stating the facts as I see them.  Last night I had one of my best Los Angeles meals at Animal, it was terrific, I still can't believe I hadn't already been. The four of us started with 6 small dishes and finished with 2 large dishes, and 3 desserts.  Can you tell we were eager to sample everything?   And yes, we had a food coma by the end of the meal. Starting off with the salad of Butter lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac..  The salad was perfectly dressed, fresh, light, and it had the perfect tang to it.  We then had the lamb meatballs, gold rice, fava beans, mint, cucumber creme fraiche:  These were delicious Greek inspired little meatballs, full of lamb flavor to savor.   Next we had the barbeque pork belly sandwiches w/slaw and the ricotta & goat cheese gnocchi in bolognese.  The pork belly sandwiches are amazing, tender, just the right size, a must have..  The Gnocchi was out of this world, in a light bolognese sauce, just delightful.  We had the chicken liver toast as well, the table loved it.  And we also had the fries, smothered in oxtail gravy, major richness here.  Wow. For our entrees we had: The crispy rabbit legs, meyer lemon aioli, peas & their greens:  My first time having rabbit, I admit it was crispy and delicious, and tender.  The accompaniments were perfect and delicious. We also had the flat iron steak, artichoke hash, truffle parmesan fondue:  The steak was fantastic, and the plating with the artichoke and the fondue, really won me over, so tasty! Desserts were: tres leches, dulce de leche bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise panna cotta, saba We loved each dessert too.  Surprise surprise.!  Right? I will be going to Animal again and again, as I look forward to trying everything they offer.  AND the menu changes, so that will keep me on my toes there too.

Out of the dishes we tried, I RECOMMEND: *Hamachi Tostada *BBQ pork belly sandwich Here's the detail: MADE RESERVATION: I tried calling the same day to get dinner reservation and twice it was fully booked.  And that's for weekday.  So you need to call few days ahead if you want to eat here. FRIENDLY SERVER: the guy stopped by to chat with us a little while we had a long gap waiting for our next dish. FOOD: 1) hamachi tostada, herbs, fish sauce vinaigrette, peanut 14 It was SO good.  My favorite of the night.  Not sure if it's partly because we were hungry and this was the first dish.  But it's crunchiness plus just the right amount of citrus, with hamachi sashimi.  I think it was relatively fresh fish, but with all the other things in the dish, the hamachi was not the highlight for me. 2) Marrow bone, chimichurri, caramelized onions 10 We were told this is one of the popular dish.  We really wasn't sure what to make of the dish.  Never had bone marrow served this way before, so nothing to compare to.  Very citrus.  We felt indifferent about this dish, but the toast that came with it was perfect. 3) Barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw 12 Very good. I think it's one of their most popular dish. Just the right amount of fat, and BBQ sauce is not overpowering.  (I hate those BBQ sauce that's super sweet) 4) Poutine, oxtail gravy, cheddar 15 It was basically threaded beef over bed of fries with cheese. This is a Huge portion dish compare to most of the other stuff on the menu.  It's filling enough to have as an entree. 5) Foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy 23 It was ok. Not sure if we were getting too full or what.  After the oxtail Poutine, we were stuffed!  Very rich dish due to the biscuit and gravy, Plus the foie gras on top.  Not a fan of this dish.  I much prefer eating foie gras with something light and refreshing to balance it out.

The meal that I ate at Animal was definitely in the top ten meals of my life. The experience was almost perversely indulgent, but I would do it again in a heartbeat. The BBQ pork belly sandwiches were rich and smoky, with a crispy, homemade bun. The bacon chocolate bar slowly revealed layers of flavor. It was pure carnal, epicurean poetry.

You find yourself in a food rut. Or maybe you are scared to try new things, but deep down you really want to. Well make that first step right here, my friend. Order multiple, random things. Dishes that sound weird and scary. It will advance you to the next level of dining experiences. From that point on...no more Cheesecake Factory cravings, or any other mainstream chains for that matter. You will become more popular, interesting and charming. And it's ridiculously casual...so wear your favorite vans and enjoy!

FOOD IS INSANE! Had 7 dishes between the two of us and each plate topped each other. My favorite of the night was surprisingly the Marrow Bone Chimichuri. Service was great, waiter pointed us out to some of their signature dishes. Make reservations! This place is known to be packed all the time and now I know why. MUST EAT if ever in the Los Angeles area, located on Fairfax close to Melrose.

After a long hot day spent in jeans and a tank, my very-foodie friends wanted to check out this "new" place, Animal. I was reluctant based on my appearance, but the promise of great food won out. And, I was very happy for it. First, the aesthetic of Animal could not be better. Not over-designed and it worked with the branding very well. It somehow managed to be casual, rock&roll and modern design at the same time. Lots of gorgeous wood surfaces, rot-iron out front, no goofy sign, earth tones and (oddly) the most amazing light-bulbs. I suddenly felt at home in my street clothes and "fancy" at the same time. The service probably helped with this too. Mostly guys and all of them sporting whatever attire they wanted. I really liked this as I could now tell our server apart from everyone else if I had a question. And, I had quite a few! He was very knowledgeable, helpful and seemed to have actual opinions about the food/wine- which I love. The food: Ok, you can't leave without getting the foire gra. It's amazing and served uniquely over a biscuit with a sauce containing a delicate sausage. I'm still dreaming about it.... The fish was citrusy and hearty for a white fish. It wasn't the most memorable dish as I am more of a seared or grilled person. But still lovely. The ribs were excellent and the sauce on them was great. I'm picky about my bbq and found these slightly dryer than i would have liked. The desert- the waffer? It has blueberries and nectarines. DIVINE. I wanted to lick the plate. My only wish is that I tried the steak. I was waaay to full that day and feel silly for writing this review without having tried it. I will update once I do though, as I am sure to return soon. ** Update** I just changed my review to 5 stars after trying more things on the menu- including the steak. This place is amazing!!!

Animal is the kind of restaurant you would expect to find in Northern California but is more uncommon in these parts.  Truly inspired cooking.  Extremely knowledgable waitstaff.   Had the amberjack, the heirloom tomatoe salad, the flat-iron steak, and the macerated strawberries.  Home run every time.  Favorite new restaurant in LA.

Top to bottom, great experience. The food was excellent, from the petite basque to the flatiron steak and pork chop from heaven. I even enjoyed the sweet breads which is something I didn't expect. The wine options weren't huge but totally sufficient for my tastes. Also, our waiter, whose name I can't remember, was very knowledgeable about the food and wine as well as the freshness and origin of the ingredients. I will go back again when I can afford it; it was slightly more expensive that I would have liked it to be.

I've died and got to heaven! When I first walked in this place, I was very underwhelmed. After all the great pics of gourmet dishes on yelp, I was expecting something a bit hotter. But within one bit into the foie gras biscuit with maple sausage gravy, I was begging them for more. Everything was great. But this dish is well ummm...WOW! This is my favorite place in LA right now. Sure I still love Mastros and Ostoria Mozza. But this is so unique and gourmet. I'm getting a craving as we speak. I need to go back and try the bone marrow. Love this if its done right. I knew that for a carnivore like myself, animal wouldn't let me down!

This is def one of my favorite restaurants!  I went with 3 friends and we ordered 1 drink each, 8 items and 2 desserts totaling $200 with tip & tax. ($50 each)  The service was a little slow and they ran out of 3 things when we were there.  So order ASAP! The foie gras is a must try, even for a first time taster.  Also try the pork belly sliders and friend quail.  Bacon crunch bar is a great dessert.  The tres leche cake was good but nothing special.

Among the glatt markets, Jewish bakeries, and kosher delis that have defined L.A.'s Fairfax District since the Second World War stands Animal, a small restaurant opened by a pair of scruffy upstarts that for two years has been creating decidedly un-kosher dishes with the gleeful moxie of a mad scientist. Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo, the two talented young chefs behind Animal, aren't afraid to put their decadent late-night food fantasies on a plate for the world to see and eat. You've heard the term "man's man"? Well these guys are "chefs' chefs," cooking the kind of food a five-star sous chef would happily serve himself after a long night of preparing meals for others, leaving the more pretentious dishes behind and going for what we all really want: comfort food. But this isn't a burger and fries sort of joint; this is haute cuisine for zhlobs - food with the power to excite Mario Batali or Michael Voltaggio as much as your boorish second cousin visiting from the Bible Belt. This is high-end fare that is affordable and accessible, pleasing to everyone so long as they choose not to notice or care what part of the animal it is they are actually eating - fine dining driven by a "whole animal" approach to cooking, and inspired by the world's best junk food. Among the inspired junk food dishes, Animal has its own version of the high-calorie Hawaiian breakfast favorite, loco moco, adding foie gras to the mix and replacing the standard chicken egg with quail egg. Thankfully, the Spam and hamburger are left in their proper place, because without them it wouldn't be a loco moco. The Animal guys have also co-opted the classic French Canadian poutine, serving their frites with oxtail gravy, and using cheddar cheese instead of the traditional white curd. As for the dishes driven by the whole animal approach, the pigs ear is the most crowd-pleasing. Shredded and fried, the ear is cooked with red chilies, scallions, and lime juice, and crowned with a fried egg, sunny side up. Though the idea of eating a pigs ear may deter the less adventurous eater, it's a delicious dish by any standard, enjoying a spicy Southwestern flair and a well-balanced interplay of textures, with the bits of meat tasting like a marriage between crispy bacon and Chinese fried noodles. But for most eaters, the thing to try is definitely the barbecue pork belly sliders with 'slaw. These hulking yet delicate little sandwiches stand tall with tender hunks of delectable belly meat slathered in sweet barbecue sauce, topped with an icecream scoop of homemade coleslaw on a warm Breadbar mini-brioche bun. Sweet and savory and full of clean, crisp barbecue flavor, these sandwiches are sure to please even the most unadventurous of eaters - something that cannot be said for some of the other items on the menu. Though Animal may not always be a place for the squeamish, the food they serve never shocks gratuitously; and if there's any shock involved, it's at the success with which these two fine young chefs have dared to be different without losing sight of their true purpose: to prepare the best food possible, and to have fun doing it. http://ShangriLAfoodblog…

I had been meaning to go here since this place opened, but between not wanting to face west side traffic and having a lot of other restaurants to try closer to home, I didn't get my butt in gear until tonight, when my fiancee booked a tasting with them (they are a preferred vendor where we are getting hitched, and apparently have pretty fantastic bbq). We arrived before they opened for dinner and sat down in the pretty spare dining room where the really knowledgeable wine and beer lady (I am sure there is a title for that function, I just can't think of it right now and jeez, the way they treated her you would think she was pretty special). She did a nice job convincing me that I do indeed like IPA's when they don't taste like sour backwash, and served a pretty tasty red blend that we will drink again. The chef and the coordinator were both pretty chill--we came up with the idea of doing a pbr toast instead of champagne for the wedding and had a good laugh about it. The food was fantastic! We had shrimp cakes, pigs in a blanket (aka little bites of honeyed goodness), and fantastic deviled eggs. Then the chef brought out the most fantastic brisket--the fatty part, which he proudly proclaimed was his favorite (no arguments there), and four types of bbq sauce. I was a huge fan of the balsamic and the mustard bbqs, but their traditional was great too. The pulled pork was delicious, the mac and cheese had a beautiful golden crust to it, and even the brioche-type toasted bread served with the pulled pork was heavenly (esp for someone who has foresworn most bread). They did not let us go hungry! There was enough for four, so we took home leftovers. And since I was there anyway, I decided to get the bacon desert I had heard about--oh and it was fantastic. It was layers of dark chocolate, salty crunchy peanuts, and bacon, with a scoop of what tasted like caramel ice cream and this awesome smoked salt that had the consistency of a certain illicit drug. It's a really perfect combination of salty, sweet, creamy, and crunchy--genious!

I had a really great dinner here and they were able to accomodate a very large group. the food was awesome and it actually wasn't that expensive. the house wine is pretty great but a few people were turned off because they serve their reds cold. Personally, i enjoyed that and thought it worked well with all the meat. the bacon fudge dessert was surprisingly good. all the sides and apps were awesome too. very good. still pretty low key too.

Oh my goodness!  I finally found a place where I can just unwind and just dine.  It's absolutely amazing!  The service was marvelous only because our server (John) paired our food progressively from a lighter fair to a heartier dish and then brought us down into a sweeter palatable affair.   And the food was something else.  My absolute favorite items on the menu were these: Pigs ear, chili, lime, fried egg/the sweetbreads, creamed spinach, capers, hen of the woods/ and the barbeque pork belly sandwiches, slaw.  Although, I wasn't impressed by the desserts but each had their own unique flavor and mixture.  It is definitely a place where I can bring my friends and relax after a hard days of work.

If I was on Food Network's "The Best Thing I Ever Ate," I would talk about the Foie Gras Loco Moco from Animal. It is absolute PERFECTION! The foie gras melts in your mouth.

Must love meat.  We stopped at Animal on a Sunday evening without a reservation.  We were lucky to snag two seats at the bar.  I was initially interested in dining here because of the bacon chocolate crunch bar that was featured on the Food Network, but after looking at the menu online I couldn't wait to try everything!  Most of the dishes on the menu are small plates so we ordered several items to share.  Carrot salad, bone marrow, pigs ear, pork belly bbq sammies, and quail.  Everything was delicious.  Our service was great.  With sparkling water, a glass of wine and dessert (the bacon chocolate crunch bar, of course), tax, and tip, our tab was right around $100 for the two of us.  I can't wait to go back.

Wow!! I went with a girlfriend, just the two of us "petit" girls...we ordered 6 items and every single one of them were delicious! We ordered only from the appetizer section since the main course didn't seem too exciting. 1. chicken liver toast - crispy bread, thick spread of liver garnished with carmelized onion and chives...nice earthy taste. 2. Soft Shell Crab open sandwich with spicy slaw - you have to order this! Amazing! bread is crusty, soft shell crab is fried perfectly (batter is crunchy and not oily), and the spicy slaw is so refreshing 3. bone marrow - it's not a small piece of bone that you need to dig through with a tiny spoon. This is some serious BONE! a huge chunk of bone split in half baked topped with chimichuri sauce. You should eat when it is piping hot.... so the fat melts in your mouth. The sauce cuts through the richness of the bone marrow. You have to try this at least once...I don;t think i will order this again...don't need that much fat in my life...but worth trying. 4. broccolini with egg and pancetta.... broccolini and egg are cooked perfectly. Very tasty. Even though it's a veggie dish, this was one of my favorite dish 5. Pork Belly - OMG - best pork belly sandwich ever! Perhabs the best non Asian style pork belly I've had. Buttery buns, fresh/crunchy slaw, thick cut of pork belly with tangy BBQ sauce. Enough said 6. Dessert - bacon chocolate bar - good chocolate bar. Can't really taste the bacon. Bacon just tasted like salty peanuts...but good dessert Will come back again for the foie gras, pigs ear, and more pork belly

I would describe the type of food at Animal slightly rustic with a modern flair.  Everything is super decadent (lots of heavy sauces).  The poutin is the BEST dish by far though.  Its the only reason why I gave this place 4 stars (yes, its that good).  The tuna salad was also very good.  I was glad that we ordered it because we needed some fresh vegetables to balance it out with all the grease.  My friend ordered the steak and it was covered in cream sauce and was way too heavy for her to finish.  I ordered the softshell crab sandwich and the portions were huge.  By the end of our dinner, we were too stuffed for dessert.  Was bummed bc I really wanted to try the bacon chocolate dish.

Talk about disappointing.  After waiting an ass load time for a table, we were finally seated to an average meal.  They were out of two things we tried to order (the ribs and shrimp) and everything else was so-so. Now I'm willing to give the food here the benefit of the doubt, (that's why three stars)... Gordon Ramsey was a couple of tables over from us, so maybe they were just ignoring us.  Either way, I'm not going back.

Some of the best, innovative cuisine I've had in Los Angeles.  Fun, playful menu, amazing flavors, easy atmosphere.  The poutine and the fois gras loco moco are fantastic.  This is the one place to try in LA!

too much fried stuff... this place was also really loud too, not a place to take your parents.. we picked this place because the menu sounded really cool. but, a lot of the food that we picked ended up being fried.  it's nice they try to introduce different kinds of meat, but it's kind of a cop out to just fry everything or completely cover it in tons of sauce.  we had the sweet breads (lightly fried), the pig tail (very fried and covered in sauce), bone marrow (lots of pesto/grease), pig ear(very fried), pork belly (greasy but good), veal brains, poutine (greasy), and foie with biscuit (foie was good when eaten by itself, but the maple biscuit completely covered the foie taste). bacon chocolate dessert was pretty good and so was the crumble. probably wouldn't come back here.

I really wanted to love this place, but the magic just wasn't completely there. It is very interesting to try, but the dishes are too hit or miss to make me want to be a repeat customer. The appetizers are definitely more interesting than the entrees. I went with foodie friends and we ordered several apps, entrees, and desserts to share. The Good     Maple Jus-sauce for the Fried Quail with Grits and Greens. The fry coating on the quail was perfection but there is just not enough meat on the quail to balance the amount of coating. I can't believe I am saying this but there was all coating and no meat. Who knew there could be too much coating? There was a spoon battle over the jus though. All agreed it was the best part of that dish. I quite liked the grits and greens though too, but then again I have a soft spot for grits.    The Basque with Chorizo-sublime, addictive. Rather entertaining that you can smell it whenever someone orders it next to you. So nice to see Spanish Chorizo which is different than Mexican.    The Tres Leches cake was the far better dessert when compared with the doughnuts. The doughnuts were overly sweet and the caramel sauce had sugar crystals in it that detracted from the texture.    The pork ribs were proper fall off the bone tender with a nice tangy/sweet BBQ sauce. I thought the vegetables underneath them looked like an afterthought and lacked any seasoning. How can one dish have stunning presentation and another look like something slapped on a plate by a short order cook?    I appreciated that the bartender offered a tasting of the two wines I was trying to decide between. A very nice touch. The carafe of wine is a great enconomical way to try several wines rather than a bottle as it is about 3-4 glasses worth. The Bad     Decor. Wait what am I saying. What decor? Lack of decor is not decor. Put SOMETHING on the walls!     The noise. Please people, in this day and age sound absorbing materials exist. Use them. It is a fairly well understood concept that people want to talk to their dining partners, not shout at them and have every other word be "What?" The Ugly      The steak entree. First off, a steak the size of a post-it note is just insulting. But a bland, unseasoned, tough steak is simply unforgivable. We ordered it because so many reviewers raved about it. I think there needs to be a field trip to Craftsteak in Vegas for an education on good steak for some of you outthere.   Stick with just the appetizers and you'll probably have a memorable meal here.

The appetizers/small plates are delicious. Mellow atmosphere when we went (early-ish on a Saturday night). The staff is confident and on the ball (I like it when you ask your server what they like on the menu, and they answer with sincere enthusiasm). My only criticism: we ordered the poutine, which was pretty tasty, but it was GIGANTIC. We would have been happy with half the portion.

I  don't think Animal is my thing. We went here for a friend's birthday and were just "eh" with it. The restaurant itself is pretty cool. Minimalist on the inside. The servers were friendly and knowledgeable. I had a great wine there. However, the meal was just OK. Perhaps I ordered wrong (I had the steak), but I thought it was overpriced for what it was(and tiny!!). My husband doesn't eat red meat (only things with fins or feathers;) ), so there were not a lot of options for him. We realized going in that a place called "Animal" would have a meat, but even most of the poultry/fish dishes had red meat in them. Also, the meals were just meat-- no vegetables or sides.  I would imagine if you like to try different types of meat--especially those that are uncommon--it would be a cool place. But for us.... well, I think it just wasn't our thing.

I told my boyfriend I felt like some MEAT, so we headed to Animal, never being there before. There were so many choices to choose from, but our waitress was very helpful and full of knowledge so she helped us out. We had the pig ears first - REALLY salty, kinda spicy, and neither of us actually thought they would LOOK like a pig ear, and yup, there they were pig ear shape and all, so since BABE is one of my favorite movies I couldn't really finish that. We both would pass on that in the future. Then we had the foi gras, OH MY GOSH, nothing has ever tasted better then this. Top ten things I have ever eaten ever. The flat iron steak was YUM and the perfect size, and the quail was too fried for my liking, tasted just like chicken, but tougher - but my boyfriend gobbled it up. Another amazing dish was the cheese appetizer (not the gnocchi, but i cant remember it exactly), anyways its got garlic bread and cheese. That's all you need to know. AMAZING. The leche cake for dessert was amazing too, but could've used a couple of berries on top. The (house) wine was delicious. Overall SUCH a great dining experience. We had to wait 50 minutes between course one and two and were pretty annoyed until the manager personally apologized, gave us free dessert, and the food melted away any aggravation :) This place is a must try, and Id go again to try all the other stuff!

from the "two dudes catering" on food network and authors of "two dudes, one pan: maximum flavor from a minimalist kitchen" comes this hit-or-miss resto on hipster haven fairfax ave. the book title says it all pros: - amberjack ambrosia: fresh & fatty even on a sunday, sprinkled with supersweet nectarines and tangy oranges were my fave of the night - dishes combine a delightful mix of my favorite ingredients - i loved reading about everything on the menu (pork belly? yes please. foie gras? don't mind if i do) -  bare bones decor keeps you focused on what's important: the animals on your plate cons: - some of the food was a bit too salty (esp pig's ear :p) - most of the dishes were a bit too heavy. aside from the amberjack, the apps were filling enough on their own - didn't leave room for dessert (my bad) all in all, mostly enjoyable.  i would recommend easing off the salt, but i would check out the cookbook.

And I want (I want), And I need (I - I nee-eed), And I love....  Ani-Mal! I don't know if it's me, but it seems that the whole ultra-cool, chef-featuring cooking shows are having an influence on both patrons and restaurants.   For my part as I diner, I can only see so many spectacular dishes served up on shows like Top Chef etc. (of which I am only an occasional viewer, not a rabid fan) without wanting to sit there like a judge and have a parade of wild concoctions paraded past my eyes and palate. Animal delivered that experience. And, per my trip to the unassuming Fairfax Blvd. restaurant last night, it would seem the restaurant staff by way of swat team/rock band, was also rising to standards set by TV.  Their performance both in the kitchen and in the dining room aspires to levels once only expected by taste bud kissing, pocket emptying places for the privileged like, say, Melisse in Santa Monica.   To start with, Animal has no sign out front; you just have to know (it's about four doors North of Cantors). The bare wall outside matches perfectly the equally bare walls inside and the all but perfunctory wooden tables and settings speak of a down and dirty mealtime more like the Kitchen in Silver Lake.  But then you sit down. The service at Animal is the kind that smiles at questions about the menu and delivers unpretentious, educated explanations; it's the kind that mysteriously keeps water glasses full and folds your napkin should you walk away for a moment.  The entire staff, while bustling dutifully, never fails to make space for you to pass or catch your eye with a natural smile. This is top flight service. Then there is the menu.  Thanks to my wife and my generous hosts, we were able to share and sample an otherwise impossible number of dishes, so here goes.  By the way, if you are vegetarian or simply don't eat pork, understand that your motivation to read on is far more curiosity than recommendation.   The appetizers menu provided most of our meal and the four of us shared each item as it was presented.  Our waitress promised an unhurried procession of goodies and true to her word, the timing was flawless.  I'm not sure a laundry list of our meal would be entirely of benefit to you as the menu is changed and printed daily, but here are a couple. I have never had head cheese but the very sound of the name always made my head involuntarily shake 'no.'  But, as it turns out, all head cheese is is pork taken from the cheeks and forehead of the pig.  If you have had fish cheek sushi, it's the same deal.  In this case the head cheese was served sort of tureen-style with pickled ramp vinaigrette and small chunks of deep fried corn bread.  If one combines the elements into a single forkful, the effect is much like a fancy pork sandwich... Not that there's anything wrong with that. The grilled squid and chorizo chimmi churri reminds you of how that combination works even outside a paella plate.  Pig ear sound nasty? Not at Animal. The meat is served in tender strips and the chili, lime and fried egg balance the saltiness delectably.  We also loved the saganaki-like melted petit basque over flavorful chorizo, scooped up on grilled bread. But the most subtly complex of the appetizers we enjoyed was the raw amber jack (a type of yellowtail) piled in with nectarine, citrus mint and chili. We had a couple of others as well, but I wanted to leave a little reading room for the entrees. We shared the very satisfying breaded, fried quail (perfect for four as two small birds are cut directly in half) served with unexpectedly creamy, buttery grits, chard and maple-sweet slab bacon. We also shared the largest, but least creative entrée; a full rack of baby back ribs covered in a balsamic sauce.  Nice, but probably not necessary.   We washed all of this back with two bottles of Napa's La Jota Vineyards 2003 Cab, which breathed its way into a smooth, fruity mouth party.   At a certain point you may ask yourself; have I had enough pork for one night? Can I just have some damn chocolate to combine with the last of the red?  Well, the answers to those questions are not mutually exclusive since Animal even porks up their signature desert!  The bacon chocolate crunch bar hit my snack palate right where it lives! My favorite movie snack is the combination of chocolate covered raisins and popcorn. The salty and sweet of it all works me like a mouth massage.  Animal's firm slab of porky three layer cake does the same, only much, much better. On the down side, the place is loud, but its well worth making your grunts and yummy noises of pleasure heard above the din.  The crowd is cool of various stripes and the location is urban enough to make a native New Yorker feel much less out of place in LA than usual. If you eat meat and aren't afraid of pissing away a few gym visits on a great meal, you need to check this one out! .

This is THE BEST restaurant in Los Angeles. I crave it when I'm awake and dream about it when I'm sleeping. The wine list - exceptional, the food - perfection, and the ambiance - just right. It's over the top in taste but low key and chill in personality. I could not say enough great things. My personal favorites items on the menu are the barbecue pork belly sandwiches, poutine with oxtail gravy and cheddar and the quail fry with grits and chard. If not in the mood for meat, they also have tasty salads with unique, complex flavors.

Preface: 4.5 stars Totally fantastic, my boyfriend says.  The "poutine, oxtail" dish (which is gourmet cheese fries with braised oxtail on top - what I've been looking for all my life) was excellent, the pork belly barbeque sandwich was excellent, the salad (arugula with plenty of shaved parmesan and grapes and apples and pine nuts) was great (though had 3 or 4 yellow leaves which is minus 1/4 star), and the padron peppers (what I live for in late summer and hard to find in LA) was really quite nice - they took a departure to the usual fried in olive oil with sea salt and put some golden raisins and feta cheese and it worked), the panna cotta was simple and nice.  Small but good selection of beer.  Hmm...well, I also enjoyed it.  Been here twice now.  Once with a friend at the bar without reservations and once again for a casual birthday dinner with reservations.  The time I went before had the smoked trout salad with the corn and avocado - excellent; smoked trout is really nice and I'm not a huge fan of smoked trout either.  The place tends to get packed and the servers are really busy and bustling around.  Still though, we were never wanting anything and anything we asked for was given to us promptly.  My only complaint was that they don't take the dishes away when they bring out the next course (minus 1/4 star).  This is a pet peeve of mine, but also fairly minor considering.  Also, pretty reasonably priced.  A dinner for two where we both left quite full was $80.  My only wish is that they had a small but good selection of whiskey.  Just five or ten different varieties of some small batch American whiskey would be heaven with all that lovely meat.

I'll preface this review with the fact that the food here was excellent and if it didn't involve interacting with anyone who actually works there, I would go back. I haven't been inspired to write a Yelp review in a long time, but this place inspired me so take it as you will. I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance for my friend's 21st birthday. She's not a party animal and I had it in my head that we would have this perfect evening, starting with a later dinner followed by a few choice bar hops. This of course never came to pass (curse me for imagining a "perfect" evening - if the universe even hears you think that word, you're screwed) because the wait for our reservation was OVER an 1h15mins. Yes, the hostess was extremely polite and obviously uncomfortable, yes, she checked in with us repeatedly and yes, they comped us a few drinks and a $40 bottle of wine (I give credit where credit is due), but frankly I came prepared to pay for all I drank; nothing you give me will make the time wasted come back. On top of this, the waitress was about as desperate to leave as we were to eat. Mostly unattentive and somewhat abrasive in her dealings with the table. She'd either be completely absent or in your face. Again, the food was excellent, the decor was nice, but the wait was unacceptable and, in my opinion, not worth the wait.

This is definitely a hit or miss place. Somethings are absolutely delicious like the the duck, braised short ribs or the petit basque. And some things are, well, not so delicious, like the deep fried quail... It is really loud, but come on, it's Hollywood. Everyone's annoying and loud. I personally like the minimalist decor. But I'm a minimalist. All and all the foods pretty delicious (when you get the right thing) but the beer and wine only make this 4 *....

Luckily I was with someone who knew there was no sign or I would not have stopped the car! Arrived around 6:30 and there were only a couple other tables full. For three people (2 big eaters) we got: -chicken liver toast -baby broccoli with pancetta, parmesan, and egg -barbeque pork belly sandwiches with slaw -rabbit with yams and onion -melted petit basque, chorizo and grilled bread -duck confit, apple, pecans, dates, and arugula -sweetbreads with creamed spinach and mushrooms -chocolate bacon crunch bar Everything was amazing! The stand-outs were the pork belly sandwich, the rabbit, and the sweetbreads (my first time eating brains). By the time we left at 8:30, it was packed and there was a line for tables, on a Monday. Get there early and be adventurous!

animal, located midtown los angeles, goes above and beyond to serve unique (at least to my amateur tastes) new american comfort food. first things first if you ever plan on dining in. make a reservation. binh and i walked in around 6:30 and was told we wouldn't get a seat until 10:45 the earliest. so that left us with two options: leave or take a seat at the bar. obviously we agreed on a bar seat and was seated within 10 minutes. the bar wasn't half bad, with enough elbow room to fit at least 4 dishes, much roomier than i had thought. first off we ordered the "rabbit loin, country ham, haricot vert, spetzel". this was the first time i have ever tried rabbit. and although i'm a rather non-adventurous eater (shame on me, i know) i knew i had to try this when i first saw rabbit on the menu. conclusion? rabbit is like chicken, but without the taste of fowl. same texture and same white meat. the dish is also accompanied by baby string beans(?), a thin layer of salty prosciutto and a zesty mystery sauce. not too rich, perfect appetizer. second was the "quail fry, grits, chard, slab bacon, maple jus". basically a small bird sitting atop a small bed of spinach cooked in a cream sauce with a side of maple infused grits. both binh and i agreed and gave this dish a mediocre rating. although i gotta admit the grits with bacon was pretty darn good inally the last appetizer and probably the best was animal's famous "foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy". this cost a whopping $22 but was worth a try. the perfectly seared foie gras is placed on a crumbly biscuit that binh describes as "to-die-for". what tied the dish together was the thick, hearty, hearty, creamy, spicy, sweet, savory sauce. for $22 this dish looks quite small but i would say the portion is just right when shared between two people. although delicious, any more would've left me clutching my stomach in agony accompanied with feelings of extreme food guilt. overall i would give this place a B+, slightly too pricy for a poor college student like me but if i'm craving some hearty food if i'm ever around LA i would definitely try Animal again, and maybe next time i'll grab some dessert too. :)

Probably the best meal of my life.  We had about 6 chicken liver toasts, the pork sliders were amazing, the rabbit was very good, the service was good for LA, the beer on tap was good.  The only slight bummer was the broccoli salad was a little tough but it won't lower the star ratining because everything else was excellent.  I will definatly be back when i come back to LA.

What a fantastic restaurant! If you are an adventurous eater, then Animal needs to be on your list of restaurants to try in LA. With understated decor--a few animal skulls tastefully mounted at the entrance to the restaurant which uniquely does not have its own name anywhere on the outside--the food and the service speaks for themselves. Animal serves all different parts of animals, and, while there are less adventurous things on the menu, if you are willing to try pigs tails, pigs ears, and bone marrow, you will be shocked at the flavor profiles and the uniqueness of the dishes. Each dish is prepared perfectly. The service is impeccable. The waiter had to chill the wine that I had chosen, so he brought me a "sample" of another he thought I might like. The sample was more like a full glass of wine, and it was excellent--something I would have picked, and it was if the waiter really watched what I had previously chosen to pick something that would suit my pallet.  You must make reservations, as they turn people away, and if you are late, they will give away your table, but given the crowd that this places pulls in, who can blame them.

Looks like a bunch of people are going here for their birthday. So I fit right in! I recently went for my birthday and left an older, yet happier man. A place like this is a one-of-a-kind find. The meat and fish were all extremely fresh and really well prepared. For the appetizer, we had the fluke, which was marinated in citrus and jalapeno. At first I was upset because it seemed a bit skimpy on the proportions. Well, that ended up being a good thing, because the main courses were well-sized. My girlfriend ordered the NY Steak. In her words, "this is the first time I've ever had a steak cooked... PERFECTLY." I can vouch, it was really tasty. As a comparison, two days later, I tried a steak at another 4-star restaurant, and I could really tell the difference. Their steak was almost sour compared to Animal's. For my course, I decided to try something I had never eaten before: Fried Rabbit Legs. Being my first time, I can only assume it was prepared perfectly. The meat was cooked all the way through and the batter was crispy and tasted of fresh oil. It was dusted with kosher salt, which lended a nice pop to the batter. I learned the hard way that rabbit legs can have very small bones which can hurt if you crunch down on them. So be careful if you're a rabid rabbit carnivore, as I now am. By this point in the evening, I was pretty tipsy from the recommended Pinot Noir. And so, it was time for the birthday dessert. Blueberry Rhubarb Tart for me and Strawberry Shortcake for her. Both of these were delicious and, again, baked to perfection. We found out they don't have a pastry chef, so one of the cooks plays double duty. Amazing, if you ask me. I have trouble chopping a carrot and turning on the stove at the same time, let alone doing all that work. Animal is and should be a success. I recommend experimenting with the seasonal menu. Try something new each time you go. Enjoy what these great chefs have to offer!

This is my favorite restaurant in LA ! The menu is constantly changing and always pushing the limits. As the name suggests, the flavors are very meat centralized, so veggies,  this may not be your kind place. I crave the fried hominy and poutine in my sleep!

It has a small bar , minimal design , and a ever changing eclectic, and unique menu.  Other than Brandywine in Woodland Hills. I have yet found a restaurant with a more  generous size of Foie Gras as I do at Animal. Can I say YUMMY.  Everything on the menu is delicious ! You can't go wrong with any of the appetizers.

Let's start by saying this: went with a vegetarian, and SHE was impressed (she loved the baby broccoli-- although I'm sure it was cooked with "some" meat derivative). We had the cod and flat iron steak. This place defines FLAVOR but it can be overkill; and should be enjoyed in cold weather. Service was wonderful. This isn't the kind of place you'll want to go to every week but we'll be back before spring, I'm sure. -

The first time I vomited was in 1996 from a case of the stomach flu. The second time I vomited was in December 2009 after having eaten at this restaurant. I AM NOT KIDDING. I read some of these reviews and decided to try it out with my sister and her boyfriend.  Maybe I didn't order the right things, maybe I should have starved myself for a day or so or perhaps I should have drank an entire bottle of wine before I began eating.  Whatever the case, my dining experience was horrible. Let me state a few things before I go on with this review so you have some perspective on my tastes.  I think most of what LA has to offer restaurant-wise is just average from Malibu to Pasadena. There are about a dozen standouts but that's it.   I don't care what the meal costs as long as it's GOOD.  My fave restaurant was Spago's on Sunset (it closed years ago). I understand the concept of the Animal restaurant - experimental American fare. But just because you can create something NEW doesn't mean it will be good. Taste should still be king. Appetizer: Pork belly sandwich - more like fat belly sandwich. Nothing's worse than biting into something you thought would be meaty with a sliver of fat and turns out to be all mushy fat.  I guess they forgot to leave some meat on my piece.  The slaw was substandard but then again KFC coleslaw is my one fast food vice. Seared foie gras - I love foie gras and decided to try it in this style.  We were served a burger sized thick slab of foie gras on top of what looked like a Jimmy Dean country biscuit (from grocer's freezer section) in a soup of canned chicken gravy.  Not appetizing at all but we tried it anyway.  These flavors did NOT match. Main: Flatiron steak w/blue cheese and  potatoes in a sherry vinaigrette (I don't remember exactly) - I had asked for well done. What I got was char-black jerky drowned in blue cheese (I think they were trying to hide the char with EXTRA blue cheese). The 5 baby slivers of potato had to be soaking in that sherry for three whole days. At least I think it was a potato. all I tasted was sherry vinaigrette. I personally do not like for a sauce, dressing, vinaigrette to completely over power the food. My sister had the fried quail. WAY too much breading on there. But it was a lot better than what I had. Dessert - Panna cotta - very plain. I was very surprised it was so plain compared to the entire menu offering that evening. Everything was soooo far to the left food-wise. Chocolate bacon bar - Disappointing after reading all the hype about it.  First bite, I thought "where's the bacon?" I studied and saw the tiniest granules of bacon, smaller than store bought bacon bits!  After my second bite I realized something else was in the bacon bar that was not listed in the menu. I asked the waiter and he told me it had nuts. Several different kinds of nuts ala the mixed nuts you see at the drugstore. Brazil, peanut, cashew, macadamia and a couple others. Really? Ugh.  Nuts have very strong, distinct flavors as do bacon and chocolate. To mix them all together is just disastrous. This couldn't possibly be what all those Yelpers are raving about it. Unless there are a LOT of fake reviews and bandwagoners on here. I LOVE chocolate but I couldn't even finish the little bar. I still like the idea of sweet, rich chocolate with crisp, salty bacon so I will make my own version at home. By the time the valet got our car, I could feel that my stomach had stopped processing the melange of food I had eaten. In spite of my review, I do encourage you to go and try something on the menu because this place won't be around for very long and you may never see something like this again ( I hope).

AMAZING!  I LOVED IT!   Every flavor and sauce is there for a reason.  Perfection! Since they do not allow modifications or adjustments to their menu, I believe that you can fully experience the chef's true creation.

Two evenings at high rated restaurants, Providence and Hatfields, preceded out evening at Animal in LA. They were all very good, but Animal was perfection without pretension. Four perfectly and delicately sauced, simply presented, masterfully cooked creations. My vote for best in town.

my first time trying a place that was supposed to be close to 5 star dining. and I have to say, it was the best meal i've ever had. started off with the bbq pork belly sandwiches. the pork belly was crispy on the outside, juicy and succulent on the inside. great bbq sauce, coleslaw on the sandwich was refreshing and really cut the fattiness of the pork belly and the buns finished it off perfectly. then i had the crispy rabbit legs with peas and a meyer lemon aioli.  my first bite of this really threw me off. the meyer lemon seemed almost overwhelming and too sharp. then as I kept eating i realized it was the perfect counter balance to the rabbit, which was juicy and falling apart (i would almost call it a gamier carnitas with less fat). and then to finish the meal off, the reason that I went here in the first place, the chocolate bacon crunch bar, s&p anglaise. three layers of chocolaty goodness. the bottom was a gnache i would guess, the middle layer was like a harder fudge with nuts and then the top was a soft pudding like texture with the acon bites mixed in. I had this with a cup of coffee and it seemed like the perfect end to the meal. the chocolate in incredible, the different textures really excite your palate and the slight saltiness of the bacon accents it all. all in all, if you're willing to spend a good amount of money, I would totally recommend this place.

We came here specifically to try the bacon chocolate crunch bar (which truth be told was more of a chocolate bar with a bacon after taste.) But other than our dessert, I thought the food was delish! The poutine was a great starter for the less adventurous members of our group (bc everyone likes french fries) and the chimichurri marrow bone was a-mazing! Also, the hamachi tostada was a really tasty and surprisingly spicy entree. It reminded me of traditional vietnamese dishes with all that good cilantro freshness. Overall Animal gave me a full belly and a big smile.

This place is great, I really liked it. I even took a few pictures and would post them, except that I'm pretty tired right now. I had the steak. It was very tasty. It had an interesting blend of sauces that felt like they were battling in my mouth; two flavors fighting against each other and it felt good. The only thing I would say is slightly unfortunate is that several of the dishes are very exotic. For example, they serve some unusual parts of some unusual animals... but then again, I stick to the basics, with a twist.

It terms of delicious food this place is 5 star for me, so good!  The service and ambiance fall flat but it's kind of hard to reduce the stars because the dishes are just so damn good. The trout salad is amazing, even though when it comes to the table it looks a little scary with the wedges of fried fish skin peeking thru here and there, weird looking but good.  Much like other reviewers we loved the Poutine and the Foie Gras with Biscuit & Maple Gravy (my fav. of the night.)  We also had the pork ribs which were very good but I would not recommend getting both the ribs and the Poutine, they are similar and both very rich.  We left feeling super satisfied, fat and happy.  We also agreed that next time we would lighten things up a little and get two salad choices and two meet dishes to reduce the guilt factor.

The food was great here. I had the burger which everyone recommends which was perfectly cooked and tasted great. They serve some unique dishes which you commonly don't see in a bar type atmosphere. The only problem I have with this place is the lack of seating. We had to hang around for a couple minutes before a table opened up but my overall experience here was good.

finally..for the first time. i had heard about this restaurant from one of my favorite food blogs long ago and had added it to my mental list of places to eat, esp since the photos were soo alluring, So  after a few YEARs,  I finally go with a friend who frequents this place so often that the waiter recognized her.  I knew we were in good hands.  I had reservations for 7pm but I was guiltily running late,  we called the restaurant to let them know that we were trying to make our reservation and they graciously pushed our reservation to 7:15!  I hate being late but it was really awesome that they were so accommodating.  A friend and I shared 3 dishes. -Pork Belly Sliders -Chimicurri bone marrow.with BUTTERY toast -Balsalmic ribs  with salad We were not STARVING so this was a good amount for us,  if I was really hungry,  i would have opted to order 4 or so dishes.  The dishes also vary in portion so i would definitely consult your waiter.  EVERYthing was delicious,  i tried to pick which was my favorite but i kept going in circles jumping from one dish to the other and back again..they were all GREAT,  the slider...i mean how could you go wrong with pork belly?  The pork belly was soft moist and buttery on the inside and crispy on the outside, kind of the way that french toast  is suppose to be..YUM..the ribs..the meat was falling off the bone and covered in a balsalmic sauce that was delicious. For dessert,  I was having a hard time deciding between my first instinct,  to order the toffee pudding, and the waiter's  recommendation,  the berries and cream dessert. I cant remember what exactly was all in it but  I decided to order the toffee pudding,  after struggling to decide and the waiter brought us BOTH!  WOW!  And i have to say that both desserts were delicious, but now,  whenever i go there,  i know that i will HAVE to order this berries and cream dessert when/if its on the menu,  berries were fresh,  its just a simply delicious,  light  dessert,  there was also pieces of some different variety of Basil that just added a unique flavor.  I think it was awesome that the waiter brought us both desserts but i'd have to credit my friend, she has the kind of face that people just want to give sweets to..I often wonder what it would be like to be her... (sigh) :D Needless to say,  the staff was very friendly, that and the food flowed out at a comfortable pace.  It was however difficult to maneuver around the tables to the bathroom mainly because the restaurant was fully seated and I feel like the more people they can accommodate to enjoy the deliciousness,  the BETTER! Awesome dinner,  I'm eager to return and to also try Son of a Gun.

First time at Animal this evening, have heard all the hype ever since it opened. Delicious, unique, creative, geniuses, etc.  I've been building up this place in my head for a long time, which always results in disappointment, but happy to say Animal exceeded all expectations.  Its not all hype, its for real. Good service, good crowd...not as LA as I anticipated. Even a Texan felt at home. Can't wait to go back next time I am in LA.

No, no, no. There is a difference between catering and running a restaurant. One provides food, the other an environment. Too many of the dishes rely on an in-your-face quality of sticky-sweet and bacony fat. All fine for immediate gratification, but short on making a lasting impression. They do well when keeping it simple: the fried chicken livers with jalapeno slaw are were perfectly crisp on the outside and still soft on the inside. The 6 hour bolognese on polenta was a welcome relief from the lumber jack food being cranked out but clearly not within the comfort zone of the chefs who seem to be intent on "awesome" rather than satisfying. The service is affable if not competent and from where I was sitting in the bar, there seemed to be a fair amount of chaos in the kitchen. I understand the venue is in the running for a James Beard award. If it gets one I may have to open my own place.

I'll go Animalistic any time! It's unusual these days to go to a restaurant where the chefs experiment with flavors and combinations that you wouldn't expect to go together but somehow work and ....damn it's good! I can't say you can go there for privacy or intimate conversations. Noise level is LOUD but the food makes up for the uncomfortable chairs and yelling at your dinner companion. Also don't try to go unless it's early or you have reservation. Split a salad that was tangy and delicious, the heirloom tomatoes were sweet. Ordered the beef and it was cooked perfectly. You can't leave without trying the chocolate/bacon desert. It can make your night.

Walked in on Wednesday night at about six. The dining room was sparsely sat but the 7 person "bar" only had one seat left. Of course being the hugest person in Hollywood that evening I had to squeeze and elbow my way in. They only have beer and wine. The beer list only had 5 choices none on tap. They served some beer by the glass out of 22 oz bottles into wine glasses. I thought the pours were a little on the small size but the beers were good. I had the white ale. Ordered the melted petit basque with chorizo and grilled toast. It was served in a casserole somewhat like a rareified fundido. The chorizo turned out to be thinly sliced like pepperoni so that it did not fully integrate with the dish in all it's porky spicy goodness. Otherwise the dish was tasty and good for sharing. The standout dish was the pork ears with chili and a fried egg. The ears were crispy and tender and the egg and chili pulled everything together. Then I had the pork belly with kim chi, peanuts and lime. Everyone at the "bar" ordered this. I have eaten more pork belly in the past 2 years then the preceding 20. I am glad to see it being more widely used and look forward to eating more. This version was only all right and not worth the caloric load for me. First of all the kim chi did not have that fermented umamai flavor. It was more like a pickled salad. The pork belly did not have that fatty funky primal flavor you get with good pork and was a little under seasoned. It was also not crispy enough and was therefore too fatty. I actually cut away fat. I never do that and look cockeyed at people who do (you know who you are). Overall I liked the place and would come again but choose to sit in the dining room. I would also go with someone and work through more of the appetizers. I thought they were stronger than the entrees.

This place is one of my favorites. I'm often at the office late, and as animal is right down the street and open til 2am, I'm here with somewhat embarassing frequency. My typical order is just two things. Sweetbreads and a bacon crunch bar. Thymus gland browned to the perfect crunchy velvety delicious texture and flavor only pieces of a cows endocrine system can provide. Being blessed with a fantastic metabolism, I like to think eating the organ that produces T lymphocytes boosts my own immune system. In fact, I'm certain that that portion of my diet is  hardening my arteries and increasing my risk for heart disease even more than my 80 hour work weeks. Now if I'm so worried about that, why am I regulary eating something called a chocolate bacon bar? A. I don't worry about. And B. Chocolate bacon bar. Chocolate bacon bar. Cho co late ba con bar. That is all. Being that it's such a haunt of mine, I deeply desire to grant animal 5 stars. And it fully deserves 4 and a half, the service is simply chronically subpar. From the bored hostess to the bland waitstaff, I'm never unhappy, just simply a tiny bit unsatisfied. In short, animal is like really hot session between the sheets with someone positively delicious, but  utterly lacking in personality. Filling, innovative and so decadent, but utterly lacking in intelligent conversation. I'll still keep coming back for more ;)

The food is fantastic, fair play to the chefs for such an inventive and delicious menu. I had the pork belly sliders and the ribs which were just amazing, the meat fell off the bone. I also got to taste the duck confit which was also very special. In general this place would get five stars but for the atmosphere. It feels bare and echoey (if that's a word) and even slightly cold. I don't know what they could do to improve this though but it needs something to match the food.

As a vegetarian it was ok. Your choices are lettuce, wine and doughnuts. I've enjoyed all of them, but not loved any. Why you ask would I go to a restaurant called animal? I'm married to a strict carnivore and plus it's a neighborhood joint. Here's what we've thought (been there twice with larger parties): -Fried hominy- good nothing too special -Pork belly sandwiches- prob the only reason to give this a higher rating- the hubby would order this every time! Outstanding! -Rabbit & ribs - would not reorder, rib sauce was boring -doughnuts- too much caramel, would reorder without the caramel next time -steak- the potatoes were undercooked (crunchy), steak ok -service- great, funny nice no problems here. I guess we just expected more from the great reviews on yelp...too high expectations...

Creative / Eclectic ! ....it's the only way to describe this dining experience.  The menu is unlike anything you will ever see....go there to see culinary minds unleashed!!   I ate there last night, and I'm ready to go back, just to try the rest of the menu....go with friends so that you can try many dishes.  The barbecue pork belly sandwiches with slaw was my favorite....two mini brioche with large "blocks" of barbecued pork on top....so flavorful, with great texture in combination with the slaw... on to our next appetizer, the melted petit basque, with chorizo and grilled bread, reminds me of queso flameado from the classic Mexican restaurants...a great American twist....again, huge flavors because of the grilled bread...mmmmmm.   The best was yet to come....we ordered three entrees this evening...the flat iron steak with sunchoke and truffle parmesan fondue was outstanding, wish we had ordered two!!  The sauces here are outstanding...clearly well thought out flavors...bravo!!  On to the balsamic pork ribs, what a fabulous flavor explosion here...ribs perfectly cooked, falling off the bone...and coated in a balsamic reduction, messy (but oh so good), accompanied by the hit of the evening the sweet potato side dish.....there wasn't enough, a perfect compliment to the ribs!!  Our last dish was perhaps the best complimented menu item...one of our dining party had a mental block..."rabbit"?!!  Yes, crispy rabbit legs, with another great sauce, meyer lemon aioli....all on top of a bed of fresh peas and greens....we were all full....but the server tempted us with dessert...and we tried two of the three...the bacon chocolate crunch bar is well documented here....we loved the panna cotta....a perfect ending to a wild dining experience....Wow...what a fun evening...come here with those friends that love food....and love trying different items....the creativity of the menu and each menu item stimulates past stories of great dining experiences...and with the right people makes for the perfect evening.  Thanks K and R.....fun times......

What a dinner! I have to say- I was totally surprised and blown away. Having heard good things from foodie friends in New York, we booked a reservation for a birthday dinner.

Went with a group of friends (there were six of us) and we had a great time. My personal favorites were the chicken liver toast, the pig ear, the foie gras loco moco, the pound cake, and tres leches cake. I recommend you go with a group of 4-6 people so that you can eat family style and order more of the dishes. They're not the most complex dishes but they're all done uniquely and leave you wanting more. The only reason why I'm not giving five stars is that we were five minutes early for our 6:30 reservation but had to wait for the last two members of our party to arrive before they'd seat us even though 3/4 of the tables (including the one they setup for us) were empty. A little common sense here would be nicer but overall it didn't detract from the meal.

I am meat eater hear me roar. The place was rather small, when we got there at 7 the place was still a bit empty until about 8 or so. Our waiter/sommelier was pretty nice. He reminded me of an Amish with the exception that well he served us the wine. On to the food: We started off with the raw amberjack, which I thought was a perfect starter for the meal. Kinda refreshed the palate for you and the amberjack was pretty fresh. After, we had a great debate between ordering the burrata or foie gras for our second app, me being the piggy that I am insisted on both. Thank heaven my dinner companion happily obliged. For the main course we shared the 109 for two, which I thought the meat was good but not that good. I suppose the novelty lies in the huge bone that they leave off for you. The foie gras sauce was its saving grace as well as the mash potato. That was yummy! We finished our meal with the bacon chocolate bar. Au contraire to popular thinking, not everything tastes good with bacon. We opted for a bottle of wine which for the life of me now I can't remember except it was pretty good. We had inquired about their house wine but the Amish dude did not recommend. Thanks Amish dude! The meal was quite enjoyable!

This place is tiny, no wonder it's hard to get reservations.  But, with it being a small size restaurant, it provides a more intimate and personalized service with waiters always giving you attention.  On top of that, the food was delicious,rich, and hearty.  Best loco moco I have ever had; why: foie gras, quail egg, and spam.  I don't traditionally like or even order beef dishes, but I had to try this one and believe me it is worth trying out.  I drool thinking of it now!  the hubby tried the poutine as many reviewers compared it to carne asada fries.  It was also delicious, but he said that at the end it felt really heavy.  So to balance off the heavy load, why not add some bacon!?  We finished with the bacon chocolate crunch bar; to me, chocolate and bacon are a deserving pair and the hubby and i reminisce on this dessert from Animal when other restaurants try to mix the 2 together (this so far has been the best interaction of bacon and chocolate we have had).

had high hopes, but didn't live up to expectations.  first of all, this place is a little difficult.  i.e. making reservations was hard (wanted to have a person join later but they made it seem hard)  strict 15 min late ressie rule, yet the restaurant was empty at the time.  when ordering, was about to ask more details on a dish's preparation, yet the spiel "no substitution or alterations allowed" came out immediately...wanted to add on an extra dish later, and our server said the chef likes the entire order at once...but ended up putting it in anyways shared many dishes among 5: *Blood Orange, Chili Oil, Castlevetrano, Red Onion -- simple but at least refreshing given all the heavy dishes *Duck Confit, Apple, Pecans, Dates, Arugula -- meat too dry (poor execution) *Marrow Bone, Chimichurri, Caramelized onion with thick toast -- too fatty, did not spread well *Hamachi, Herbs, Fish Sauce Vinaigrette, Crispy shallot on a tostada chip -- ok *Barbeque Pork Belly Sandwiches, Slaw -- fine, but run of the mill, sauce little too overpowering *Melted Petit Basque, Chorizo, Grilled Bread -- smelled good but too salty *Balsamic Pork Ribs, Apple & Fennel Slaw, Almonds -- ok *Grilled King Crab, Tabasco Butter -- good crab, strange butter but not overpowering *Catfish, Collards, Rutabaga, Grainy mustard -- way to salty, not good, don't order *Foie Gras Loco Moco, Quail Egg, Spam, Hamburger -- cute looking, one of the tastier dishes because of the foie gras nicely seared --overall, their sauces were not enhancing, too much salt, maybe we needed different dishes...

The steak.  I've had what I thought was a good steak, but Animal elevated it to the next level.   Putting that first piece in my mouth, then  bitting down, there was this delicate crunch from the perfect sear of the steak like I had never experienced before.  It was cooked to a medium that only someone who cares about what they are serving can do.  The flavor of the truffle parmesan fondue was rich yet not overpowering.  Seriously, I think Animal has ruined steak for me as they are now the standard for how I will judge a steak by.   Now, the highlight was the fois gras with maple sausage gravy on a biscuit.   There is a question on Yelp when creating your profile - what would your last meal on earth be? - well, I now have an answer for it as I assumed that I would die hungry, but thanks to Animal, on my deathbed I will make a final food request and die a happy man.  It was that good!!!!  What I liked about Animal was the way they paced your meal.   Even though you order a bunch of items in the beginning, it felt like they analyze the order and then send it out one dish at a time creating a progression of flavors that when we arrived at the fois gras, i felt myself climax.   So perfect, and not once did I feel rushed or not wanted.  I love this place and I am already dreaming about going back ASAP!!!!!

Basically in a nutshell I can't wait to go back. Seriously, just get your booty over here already. Its really that good. Expensive, yes, but worth the flavorful experience. Awesome service. The bartender was also my server. Casual atmosphere over fancy food...gotta love it. I wore a hoodie when I came in and felt comfortable. Love the hamachi salad and I'm not really a salad eater but why oh why am I craving it! The most AMAZING salad I've ever had. So simple so ridiculously delicious. I thank my server for recommending it! The pilsner beer they serve is pretty great too. Not sure what brand it is but ask for the pilsner in a can. Also ordered the poutine, fried pig ears with fried egg, and the ravioli dish. All excellent. Will most likely be back over and over again until I try everything on their menu. Just fyi, street parking and valet available. Place is small and has no sign in front so you can easily miss it. I think reservations are best but we got there right when they opened on a weekday so luckily a table was free or you can sit at the bar and get full service if seats are available. Overall, one of the best dining experiences I've had.

Every time we come here the Mrs. and I are never disappointed. You have to be ready for rich decadent food, and the fact that it's uber trendy, but you cannot go wrong with the pork belly sliders, anything with fois gras, or the bacon chocolate dessert.

Heard about animal from a friend, although sitting across the street from some of my favorite shops ( turntable lab, family, etc ) I was bound to discover it.  The "two dudes" have come a long way since their long hair stoner shenanigans... Wine man took care of us nicely, apps were all shared and all good.  short ribs fell off the bone a lil too much... asparagus salad had a great texture thanks to the poached egg poppin' on the plate... but i think the bacon vinaigrette gave it a lil bit of an odd taste.  Amberjack would have been a perfect first course app, but it came out last... big chucks of this stuff with citrus and paper thin habanero slices made this dish stand out in my book... my only change would be making the chunks of fish smaller... or cut in a different shape, the large cube effect doesn't seem to work in sushi spots and its not entirely working here.  Obviously choice for app loving was the "deconstructed pizza" dish i forgot what it was called.. but the gooey cheese in the ramekin with sliced chorizo ( made to mimic pepperoni slices ) is spooned onto your toasted bread and quickly devoured much like a mulberry's slice.  Thanks to a large party "killin" em last night our main course choices were slim to nil.  Fried Quail all around and it was delicious.  Grits were great, sauce was perfect.. could have used more of it, as it was helping cut the the ferociously seasoned quails.  i felt like some kinda giant monster eating a quail wing the size of my pinky finger too. The thick slab cut bacon on the side was good, but was 95% fat, which was pretty rough to take down.  Menu changes weekly, so I'm looking forward to what these dudes will crank out in the future.

Animal is a restaurant I like to frequent and I've been doing so for quite sometime. As a carnivore, I admit that Totoraku is a slice of heaven. Nonetheless, I find this place to be a delight. Now I'm sure everyone has their idea of what to eat when perusing the menu and if you make your way here, you're probably open to anything. For those less open to new culinary experiences, it is important to note that this is a very palate friendly kitchen. So I'm suggesting a few items that I hope will be tried by the less "adventurous" spirits. Veal brains: The preparation here is a good introduction. A bit too heavy on the breading for my taste (particularly for the thin slices) which tends to mask the taste in my estimation, but if you've never had veal brains, you should try it here. You'll get the familiar "coat of fried chicken" but with a glimpse of the richness that veal brains has to offer. This is also a great primer to sweetbreads (counter-intuitive as it may seem). I've asked if they could just dust the brain with dry starch, but deviation from there normal preparation is not going to happen. So again, safe. Pig ears. If you love crispy bacon, you will enjoy this. Break the loose egg and let the yolk run its course over and through the slices and you are in for a treat. Now these are given essentials: Foie Gras with biscuit and maple sausage gravy. Why I never had this combination prior to Animal is unknown to me. This is a brilliant combination. God bless Jon and Vinny along with whoever it was that decided marrow would be a great variation as a topping to bruschetta. Pork Belly Sandwich: Just because you should always have pork belly whenever the opportunity avails itself. 5 stars for the food. Especially for the quality in this price range. Now, if they'd only bring back that Flinstone sized Bone-In Ribeye!

fuck. what a disappointment.... seriously, the pork ribs aren't that great. i've had much better... and the long wait for dinner was ridiculous. after our apps we had to wait well over an hour before we were served. i was hoping the steak & fried quail were worth it, it was good, but not crave worthy.  the only memorable thing was the fucking noise. so LOUD we had to yell at each other to have a conversation. i seriously wanted to punch my friend in the face cuz i thought we were fighting. the only way i'll come back here is if i'm invited for a party... and even then i'll try to convince them to go elsewhere. the best part of the meal was the blueberry white peach dessert.

i think emeril had it right. pork fat does rule. kinda hard to find this place because there is no sign or name attached to the restaurant. got there at 6:20 and there was only one table filled. 30 minutes later the place was packed. started off with queso fundido and ribs. ribs being pork ribs glazed with balsamic and the queso fundido containing ample amounts of crispy chorizo. then we had crispy quail with bacon slab and a flat iron with sweetbreads. everything was on point. waitstaff was insistent on selling us some alcohol. casual setting with great food. my kind of place. they just need to add some beds in the back so that people can take naps after consuming all that pork fat.

Here's the scoop: the food is AMAZING. I have to say it's one the tastiest restaurants in LA and I'm not even a big "meaty" eater. But every single dish that came out (and we ordered over half the menu) was superb. Delicious, perfect. The kale salad was so totally amazing I am dreaming about it. The flat iron was awesome. The pork ribs in balsamic was fantastic. The pig ears even I liked, they were sooo tasty. The negative and why I'm only giving 3 reviews is the service. We came in with a group of 6 for my husband's birthday. The hostess was fantastic and totally nice. It looked like 2 other waiters were good too but we had this bald guy with tattoos on his arm and he was the typical uninterested, play aloof and condescending to the table the whole night. So frustrating! At one point when we were being poured our wine by our waiter he spilled a cup full of water which broke all over the table and spilled cold water all over the lap of a couple at our table. We literally did not even get a "sorry". They wiped it up and that was that. The couple had to flag the waiter down to get new napkins that's literally how uninterested he was. So the evening proceeds, we order two very nice bottles of wine, tons of things on the menu, desserts, etc. We sang happy birthday, etc. Then the bill comes. We had all noticed that they forgot to bring one of our dishes (asparagus, which is an easy one to remember didn't come). We were pretty full so we never mentioned it, assuming the waiter forgot to place the order. But of course it was on the bill. So I get up and tell our waiter that the asparagus never came. A waitress next to him says, "no, you did, I remember bringing it to your table". So I sort of think maybe me and everyone else at our table is wrong?? She seems so adamant. I asked her how it's prepared and she said asparagus with an egg on top. Now I clearly know we only had 1 dish that has any egg on and that was the pig ears. So I tell her I'm 100% sure the only dish we had with egg was the pig ears and definitely no asparagus. I get a lot of sighing and heaving breathing and rolling of the eyes. Ultimately they took it off the bill but they made us feel like criminals. And this was a  birthday dinner for a 34 year old; doctors, VPs, professionals at our table, we spent almost $1K on dinner and they think I would get up and lie about a $14 dish of asparagus?? The waitress was beyond rude. It left a bad taste in all our mouths the rest of the night which is why I sadly have to give the place a 3 star instead of a 5 star the food deserves.

This place is a carnal celebration for the true carnivore within.  I'm a picky eater (translated as I have the eating habits of a five year old) but I am definitely willing to try food out of my comfort zone, especially when the menu screams such beautiful meat decadence.  This is comfort food taken to the next level.  With a small group of friends, we sampled a good portion of the menu and nothing disappointed.  I even ate friggin' parsnips and for the first time in my life thought they were palatable, even...dare I say...tasty!  Desert was a bacon infused heaven that makes my naughty places tingle.  The waitstaff was friendly, helpful, and fun, too.  My one complaint is that the bar only serves beer and wine and I wish they catered a bit more to the degenerate alcoholics amongst us by offering a little whiskey juice (Papa gets mean when he don't got his medicine).  There is an LA based artist named Big Tasty. A lot of his artwork centers around pigs, beef, and sausages.  This is the restaurant he saw in a peyote inspired vision while living in the Galapagos Islands.  One day he and I will go there together, dressed in the furs of our ancestors.  We will eat with our bare hands, tearing into the meat and wiping the grease upon our determined faces like a bloody warpaint.  When we leave that day, we will have changed in ways that most will never comprehend...and vegans will fear us, never knowing why.  All will be right in the universe.

I decided one I am in LA, why not try animal resturant with one of my friend. The place itself was very crowed but there isn't a sign outside so we were alittle lost until we found someone who told it where it was. Don't listen to google because it was wrong LOL it is at 325 location . Anyway we order the a bottle of wine to start off with and continue to order 7-8 plates off of the appretizer menu from chicken liver to deep fry quail w/grid and chard. Our 1st plate came out Chicken liver w/carmilize onion and i am pretty sure they put maple syrup with it and i think the onion made the plate then came the flute fish which was a hugh disappointed plate. Our 2 next plate was rabbit of loin w/harsh chirizo which was bland but the quail was very tasty which as KFC style. We order order the ox tail chilli cheese fries which was good and a few more plates but i think after awhile all of them tasted the same. For dessert we order the deep fry candybar w/bacon and i did tasted the bacon but it was so-so to me. The concept of the place was a great idea and the taste was ok but i guess i wanted more

If you want something different, and you have a few hundred dollars you want to spend on food (ok maybe I'm exaggeration a bit) this place is for you.  I went there with a group of friends, there was 4 of us, we basically told the waiter to hook us up, and he chose for us.  Everything that we tried that day was amazing, chocolate + bacon = goodness.  The place is small and popular so you might want to make reservations well in advance, I would think it's a great place to take a foodie for their birthday etc.

Foie on a biscuit with maple sausage gravy?!!  I'll eat that all day, ALL DAY!  If you're a fan of radishes get them. It comes with awesome butter and sea salt.  Very old school french food.  The beer recomended by our waiter went very well with our meal.  If you got a sweet tooth then get the tres leches, but i suggeset the panna cotta with cherry jam.  DELICIOUS!  All in all this place is a t-shirt and jeans place with great food and good atmosphere.  Eat here it's worth it.

The restaurant was a bit pretentious (no sign) and I couldn't say the food was the best I've ever had but The Bacon Chocolate Bar Crunch and the Pork Belly Sandwich were delicious! The menu was interesting and it was fun to push my palette, but the hostess wasn't particularly friendly and our waiter's level of perspiration made me uncomfortable when he handled our food. My belief is that if a restaurant is going to be this "elite," their wait staff should be hot...not their body temperature.

I had heard a lot of great things about this place, so I decided to finally give it a shot. I was not disappointed. The service was great, the waiters attentive and good humored, and the ambiance perfect for a date or a nice quiet chat. We should have looked on yelp for some customer favorites, but I think we did well with the items we ordered. The Hamachi and Cavatelli were pretty good, but nothing life changing or worthy of writing home about. The Octopus was pretty darn impressive though. I don't believe I'd ever had octopus cooked to that kind of soft and non-chewy consistency before, and the taste was so savory that it really didn't strike me as seafood. I love me some good octopus, but what they did in changing this one around was brilliant. By the time the pork belly sliders came around we were getting a little full, but yum, still worthy of mentioning and ordering should you go. I definitely would go again, and am pretty confident another visit may win this restaurant a fifth star from me.

Animal is not a place for vegetarians.  There is great love here for all things meat, particularly pork.  Which meant my friends and I fit right in - we fully subscribe to the belief that "bacon makes everything better!"  Our evening did not start of that smoothly (e.g., really awful valet system and bad acoustics in the room causing diners to have to shout at one another) but the good food and service more than made up for it.  For apps, we had:  melted petite basque with chorizo and toast (this was soooo divinely good, bubbly savory cheese spread onto toast...mmmm); foie gras on biscuit and sausage gravy (while we all agreed the biscuit overpowered the dish with its size, the seared foie gras was delectable and the gravy was 'lick your plate clean' good); pork ribs (good, but no spectacular).  For entrees, everyone else in my party had the fried pork chop (very tender and juicy) but I had the niman flat iron steak with chanterelles, corn and sweetbreads (marbly yummy steak, nicely accompanied by the sweet corn, etc.).  Desserts were a bit disappointing.  We tried the strawberries with pound cake (nice but not particularly special), the blueberry crisp (again, just ok) and the chocolate with bacon (strange, but one friend really liked it).  We would definitely come back to enjoy the delicious food again, but we may skip dessert next time!

Arriving at animal with reservations to find out there was a banquet wasn't the most pleasant experience.  We were told that they could accommodate us in thirty minutes and they ended up dropping the corkage fee on the wine we had brought.  We stopped at a bar across the street and had a beer while we waited.  The food was so good we forgot about the wait.  I suggest splitting the foie gras appetizer, it is quite heavy and good for two.  For the main course I had the niman flat iron which was cooked perfectly all the way through.  The Madeira sauce surrounding it was so gawd damn good.  Also on the menu for the evening were monkfish, pork chop fry, whole grilled branzino, and the 109 for 2 (ribeye for two).  For desert I wish I would have chose different.  I had the mulberries and santa rosa plum.  The fruit was delicious but just nothing to rave about since there was really nothing more to it than the fruit itself.  I will come here again for sure if I am in the LA area.  I wish I could have tried the whole menu, everything looked and sounded amazing.

This place will blow your mind!  You can tell whoever creates this menu absolutely knows what they are doing.  I would not take anyone that is a picky eater to this place because it would be a drag.  Take only your brave friends.  The Pork Belly Sliders are INCREDIBLE.  Where to start... The soft buttered bun, the crunchy/tangy/sweet/spicy slaw, the BBQ sauce- When you bite into these tasty morsels the juice bursts out on to your face, that's how amazing it is.  The Foie Gras Biscuits and gravy will change your life.  The Bone Marrow with chimichurri sauce is so decadent that it almost brings tears to your eyes.... Don't be shy!  Sample the menu- I've never had anything I didn't like- You have to try the bacon candy bar!  It's like a "Butterfinger" on steroids.  If you are by yourself sit at the bar- Order some amazing beer and the sliders.  This is the kind of place that you can dress up or rock it casual.  The waitstaff is totally cool and really enthusiastic about what they are selling you.  If you are unsure about what you like don't be afraid to ask them.  If you like belguim white ales, go with La Chouffe (Has a little gnome on the front)  Go easy, a couple of those and you might see little gnomes running around... What can I say... This is my favorite place in LA! YUMM!

And for my main i had a the flatiron with bourdelaisse and sweetbreads, holy crap! i am a meat eater and i think that maybe the best piece of meat i have EVER eaten, simply perfect! and then comes the bacon crunch bar! at first bite it seems kinda odd but you just keep eating and every bite gets better and better until its over and you suddenly become sad that this is the end of a truly great dinner. i just wanted to start over!! i will be back again and again!

excellent food, lovable, professional staff, fun, hip, friendly atmosphere. shaved asparagus, poached egg, and grana was done just right.  inventive, beautiful, lovely tastes and textures.  would love this for brunch every weekend with bit of brioche. foie gras with sausage gravy and biscuits was fantastic.  foie gras was perfect, generous portion, seared perfectly, not to greasy.  surprisingly, this dish was nowhere near as heavy as expected. pork ribs fell off the bone.  panzanella, tomato, arugula salad on the side balanced it perftectly.  a generous 5 or 6 ribs made sharing very easy.  rich and flavorful without huge chunks of fat, so surprisingly not greasy. baked cheese and chorizo was delicious, albeit a big heavy - what are you going to do, it's a dish of baked cheese and chorizo! all appetizers went really very nicely with their alsatian sparkling wine. 109 for two - ribeye on the bone with a smooth foie gras sauce and delectable whipped, buttery potatoes.  ordered medium rare, done perfectly.  best steak i've had in LA so far.  a great follow up to a miserable cote du boeuf i was served at the dakota. prosciutto wrapped halibut served with faro was light and tasty, but was outshined by the 109.   had a carafe of the cote du rhone, which was soft and smooth, not to acidic, not too heavy.  light, served very slightly chilled, and unexpectedly refreshing for a red. the chocolate ganache with bacon bits was absolutely delicious.  a bit rich to finish the entire dish, but a perfect mix of salty and sweet.  this bacon/chocolate combination seems to be getting more and more trendy, so sometimes a bit of a gamble, but here, it was executed perfectly.   the blueberry crisp was sooo good and tasted like it was home made from scratch by your favorite roly poly southern aunt. the macerated strawberries and poundcake were simply the best strawberry shortcake i've had in ages. two anecdotal details that speak volumes for this place - apparently there were a couple different tables where waitstaff members had chosen to come for dinner as customers and bring friends.   - both tables ordered the 109. only complaint - the noice level can get pretty high, particularly if there is a large group enjoying lots of wine. looking forward to the art to come!

I should have looked at the menu before taking someones rec and going there and so should you. If you like weird or semi weird foods then you will probably like this place. If not, then stick to AOC if you want small plates. Pork belly sandwich was literally a piece of fat with some meat on the sides. took a big bite not knowing that and the texture of semi cooked fat did not sit well. other dishes i had were ok like the salad and pork ribs but not anything impressive overall.

To die for! The service was phenomenal, and the food was even better. We shared two apps, two entrees and a dessert, and definitely left with some leftovers. The kale salad seemed so simple, but was a pungent mix of spicy and sour notes. The duck confit salad was complemented by figs and apples. I loved the flatiron steak with caramelized vegetables. And the pork belly with kimchee was insane. Even the pineapple upside down cake was brilliant (unfortunately they ran out of the donut!). The waiter gave great recos and allowed me to taste two wines before committing to a glass. The place was packed. Only downside? a bit noisy - you feel like you have to yell above the din. But a great deal all the way around.

The line between fine and casual dining is blurred at Animal and not necessarily in a good way. I appreciate the idea that the chefs or owners want to create a laid-back atmosphere that serves adventurous and inventive high end cuisine, but there's something about having foie gras with marshmallow and yam puree while a deep Jay-Z cut pounds over the speaker that seems incongruous.  That said, the food is amazing! The server mentioned it's a "small-plates" style, yet the prices don't reflect that. The foie gras, bbq pork belly sliders and the sweetbreads were all highlights.  The Animal label wine was unpretentious and delicious. I did have a problem when I asked the server for more bread to finish the foie gras. He made an effort to show us he's going out of his way to provide it and then he charged us $2 for it. Not cool. Utlimately it comes down to the food for me. I'd return to Animal for sure but I may bring earplugs next time.

The waitstaff was very informative, the food was fresh, flavorful, well prepared, and well presented. Don't miss these appetizers: cheese with chorizo, and pork ribs pork ribs. The squash is deep fried not dissimilar to tempura, and isn't impressive. As for entrees, the monkfish soup is flavorful and interesting, and the flat iron steak is great as well, though non-traditionally prepared.

came in here and plowed thru 6 apps and 1 dessert with my brother. we started with the pouline and pork belly sliders. the pouline may be the best cheese fries with gravy ever! 10 yr aged cheddar and beef gravy with chunks of beef. so friggin good! the sliders, as our waiter said, are like crack. i love pulled pork sandwiches, and sub in pork belly, with the fat melting in your mouth, yum! next round was the pork belly kimchi and pig ear. Both were good but not as good as round 1. the kimchi overpowered the pork i felt. and the pig ears were overpowered by the chili. with that much pork in front of me, i didnt feel like i got that much pork flavor. good texture though. moved on to the amberjack tartar. i love raw amberjack, and this dish did not disappoint at all. citrus, mint, peaches with chili oil all messed so well! we finished the apps with the foie gras biscuit and gravy. 2 nice sided lobes of foie, and tasty made biscuit, and maple gravy. my only complaint with the dish would be there was only 1 biscuit. and we finished with the bacon chocolate bar. tons and tons of chocolate with hazelnuts? and bacon bits. the chocolate dominates, but then you get this crunch. and as you chew, the bacon flavor comes thru, and yum!

Amazing restaurant! I love that the decor is super minimalist because supposedly the 2 owners sank everything they had into the place and couldn't afford to decorate. Even more awesome that they're doing so well. My boyfriend and I came in a little early for our reservation, but the hostess was happy to seat us at the bar. The bartender was cordial and available. When our table was ready, the server who waited on us was knowledgeable and enthusiastic. My favorite part was the bacon and chocolate dessert. Sound strange? Try it. You'll love it.

Awesome, meaty goodness! This place has never disappointed. Casual, trendy, hipster vibe... Very knowledgeable servers, cooks in t-shirts slingin" some very creative visions of some comfort food done with every part of an animal in a very clean and delicious manner. Food is why this place exists. You can taste the 2 chef's passion in each dish. Food is amazing. Nicely done, gents.

The food was amazing and delightfully memorable.  After leaving this restaurant, I couldn't stop thinking about my BBQ pork belly sandwiches with coleslaw and the foie gras, biscuit and maple sausage gravy dish.   I personally loved these two dishes the absolute best (as did others), but go with a group so you can order a bunch of the dishes.  No one was disappointed. For appetizers, we ordered the quail fry (also really flavorful), the poutine (fries with oxtail gravy and cheddar - I liked it, but this really isn't the poutine you'd expect if you're from Quebec), chicken liver toast, duck confit, and the foie gras loco moco with quail egg, spam and burger.  I'd highly recommend all of these.  We also ordered the baby kale as well as the beet salad, and both were far too salty and vinegary (blegh).  Yep, shouldn't have ordered veggies at the Animal restaurant.  Entrees, we had the foie gras mentioned earlier, the ribeye with mashed potatoes (which fed 3), the balsamic pork ribs with delicata squash and cippolini onion vinaigrette (lip smacking good -- and huge - enough for 2 - and even the squash was yummy), and the flatiron steak.  All were fantastic.  For dessert, we ordered the bacon chocolate crunch bar (couple of my friends loved it but I personally didnt' like the taste), Joe's Doughnuts (nothing special, but very light and airy), and the tres luches/dulce de leche (YUMMM, definitely the best).  I loved this restaurant.  Plus the decor is minimalist and cool, with a great vibe.  Our server was superb as well.

Hands down one of my favorite casual establishments in Los Angeles. great if you like to try a lot of different items. However, if you don't eat meat, this is not the place for you. Eat at the bar last minute, the bartender is always great and very helpful in suggesting dishes.

so after hearing sooO much about this place i was ready to be blown out of my mind.  however like many things that are hyped up the end result did not meet my expectations. chicken liver toast - pretty gross...not a huge fan of liver but the liver taste was more overpowering than what i could take. our table left half them uneaten. grilled octupus - one of the better items but a lil too chewy and sauce was a little bland marrow bone - good but the chimichurri sauce was too strong so took away from the luscous marrow.  however creamy and cool how you could scoop out of the bone and spread on slice of bread oxtail poutine - one of the highlights of the night. tender and flavorful oxtail over bed of french fries. i wish this dish came out earlier pork buns - the other highlight of the night. nice big fatty pork belly that was flavored well and nice buns with cabbage slaw.   pig ears - vinegar taste was overbearing and after a few bites you get sick of the dish.   sweat breads - i've never known why the heck they call intestines sweat breads but these were pretty gross.  the sauce was good and was psyched to try but the texture and flavor combination just did not sit well. not sure if our palates are not as sophisticated as a true foodie as we tried to rationalize our meal. but i feel most people come for the experience of eating bizarre food rather than taste. oh but the cool thing is it's a hot spot for celeb chefs. marcus from top chef was sitting next to our table.

Although the wait for the actual food was noticibly long (20 minutes for appetizers and 30 minutes for entrees), the wait was so worth it.  I came here on a Saturday night without a reservation around 9ish.  Even though the place was packed, I only waited for a table for 15 minutes at the bar.  When I got seated, I ordered a cheese and chorizo baked appetizer and the quail fry entree.  My friend ordered the flat iron steak.  I seriously had a foodgasm with the chorizo appetizer (should have ordered two!)  The quail fry was a sophisticated fried chicken dish.  We also ordered two desserts: the tres leche cake and berry tart.  Both were very good, but the crust on the berry tart was a little dry.  The service here is very friendly and accommodating, which makes up for the long wait for the food.  Atmosphere is lively but classy.  The prices are a little steep for my budget, but I'll definitely bring friends here for appetizers and beer.

This was another place that I came to know about through my favorite Food Network show, "The Best Thing I Ever Ate". I'm happy to say that the bacon chocolate crunch bar that Duff Goldman suggested was quite delicious. My friends and I also ordered the Caramel Donuts and those were good too. The ambience is definitely younger and more hip. In fact, this area has many other shops around it. Though many of the retail spots are vacant, there are a few establishments around Animal Restaurant that show that this place is still trying to find an identity. Next to Animal Restaurant is a Jewish bakery and across the street are a few hipster-type stores. Animal Restaurant definitely fits into the hipster category. The servers at this restaurant were very kind and a few of them are quite good-looking. They also suggested some wines to me and let me try them out before committing to a whole glass. I ended up with one of their moscatos and it was quite delicious. I only went here for dessert and I can't wait to come back to try their entrees. Just a note to people coming here for the first time, make a note of their address because this restaurant does not have signage outside. They in an unmarked retail space.

The food here was good, even great for the price.  was everything perfect, no. It is definitely on par with other high class, seasonal, new american cuisine.  lots of interesting combinations and the menu had many choices of unusual animal cuts - none of which my party would let me order. there were three of us, and this was plenty of food - everyone was full at the end and got a good, hearty taste of everything. first off - we had the house cabernet.  which for $20 was a great deal for the quality.  at $12 for a glass of their other options - definitely worth getting. here is what we ordered 1) lettuce, beets, avocado, pita, feta, creamy sumac $11 - delicious, not exactly veggie heavy with avocado and feta - but light and a very good start to the meal. 2) ricotta ravioli, basil brown butter, cherry tomato $12 - came with about 5 raviolis, delicious little cooked cherry tomatoes.  the brown butter sauce was light and pretty pure - could have even had a stronger flavor.  this was a light dish, but not that different than other nice raviolis - definitely more interesting things on the menu.  good if you are looking for something everyone will like. 3) grilled octopus, chorizo, chowchow $17 - This was great and probably my favorite dish.  the octopus might be the best grilled octo I have ever had.  it was very flavorful and not a bit chewy, more meaty and very satisfying and there was lots of it.  I expected the chowchow to be more julianned - but it was instead more chopped - it and the chorizo (which was more like a little hamburger patty) went perfectly with the octopus.  interesting combo and great flavors.  very unexpected. 4) quail fry, grits, chard, slab bacon, maple jus $16 - the quail was cooked perfectly and tasted just like fried chicken, delicious crispy friend chicken. which would have been delightful, if it had been chicken - but because it was friend I didn't get much quail flavor and since it was quail it was pretty small.  a baby chicken or cornish hen would have been bigger and probably tasted the same.  the chard and grits were delightful, but the maple jus was overly sweet.  it went with the other flavors, but considering the next dish we got - the sweet maple flavor was overwhelming and hid what little quail flavor there was. 5) foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy $23- we couldn't come and not get the foie gras biscuit - everyone raves about it and I LOVE foie gras, humane or not.  the foie was a huge slab, like they just cut a 1/2 inch thick chunk off the liver.  it was perfectly cooked, had a gorgeous seared flavor.  delicious.  But what I wasn't so keen on was the rest of the dish. the biscuit was nice, but didn't add much to the dish other than starch.  the maple sausage gravy was WAY too sweet and all over everything the biscuit was practically swimming.  when you had a complete bite with every part of the dish you could hardly taste the foie gras, even with the sear which was unfortunate because it was so beautifully done.  now to be fair - my dining mates loved it and didn't think it was too sweet, but as a foie gras lover and admitted purist, it was all a little over the top and unnecessary.  so if you like sweet things and foie gras you will probably like this.  it was just too much for me! DESSERT. bacon chocolate crunch bar, s&p anglaise $7 - this got rave reviews from others, and the chocolate ganache was excellent.  however the bacon crumbles added nothing but salt - unnecessary and almost making it unpleasant.  I preferred it without the bacon - sacrilege I know. sticky toffee pudding, mascarpone, orange zest $7 - this was an amazing dessert. highly recommended.  the perfect amount of sweetness and flavor. apparently sticky toffee pudding is like breadbudding with cake - very most, sugary and delightful.  the orange zest added another layer of flavor and brightened up the dish considerably.  a must.

I enjoyed half of the food we ordered; we had about 6 starters between the two of us.  The funny thing was that I didn't like any of the stuff that our (very cute) waiter recommended, including the duck confit (too dry) and amberjack carpaccio (too citrusy).  The beets salad was underwhelming mostly because of the dressing.  My companion liked the squid/chorizo; I felt I had had better squid or chorizo separately at other places.  The combination didn't add much.  We couldn't decide between the two pork belly dishes at first, and we landed on the one with kimchi.  Lest you think our decision was clouded by the attractiveness of our waiter, he suggested the slider better, which he compared to crack.  I think we made a good choice.  The taste was more complex than all the other dishes we had.  I also liked the chicken liver toast - so fluffy and livery.  So the lesson?  Like the namesake, stick with the meaty dishes on the menu.  The best part is that the waiter took care to space out our food - we spent almost 3 hours there - and arrange the lighter fares to come out first.  The timing was perfect - we never had to wait for anything, and our table was never crowded.  I thought that was really thoughtful.  I'd say the food is 3.5 stars, but the service was impressive.

I didn't like this place.  For many reasons. -First, we arrived 15 minutes early.  We could see our open table for 8 (plus many other open tables). They weren't sure if they could seat us. They had to check with their manager. What? Are you going to seat someone else's party and turn the table in 15 minutes?  The manager (surprise) said OK. -We ordered drinks.  We asked if we could order some appetizers to get them going while we waited 5-10 min for the rest of the party. The waiter had to check with the manager.  What? We can't order?  Of course, the manager said yes. -The appetizers didn't look so good on the menu because it was hard to know what a lot of things were. But, with some explaining we picked a couple. These were good. We had a french fry disk that was meaty and cheesy, a bbq pork sandwich that was good, and cheesy toast things.  These were all good. So, I was optimistic about dinner. -The appetizer selection was great -- lots to choose from.  Entrees -- not so much.  There were like 4-5 things.  Most didn't seem that great.  I was about to get the beef when the waiter suggested to another person at my table that the fish was excellent.  It has a Tabasco component.  I don't really like tabasco. So, I asked about it.  The waiter said you could barely taste it.  What?!?!?! It tasted like I took a piece of fish and sprinkled tabasco all over it.  It was so bad.  There was crab on there (my favorite) and I couldn't eat it.  I had two bites and that was all I could take.  So, so bad.  2 other people at my table got it and they didn't like it either.  I had some of my husband's steak. This was really good. I think that is it.  We didn't get dessert -- we went next door.  Now I know why they were slammed by the LA Times.

We just came back from Animal and I must say I was a bit disppointed after hearing rave reviews about this place.  We had the melted petit basque with chorizo and garlic bread, the bbq pork belly sandwiches and rabbit legs with bacon and peas.  The petit basque was excellent, crispy toasted garlic bread topped with melted gruyere cheese and carmelized onions.  The bbq pork belly sandwiches were also very tasty, the pork was tender and topped with a very tasty cole slaw.  The rabbit legs were just average.  Every dish was very simple but you can definitely taste the freshness and high quality of the ingredients, which are all organic from local farms.  Ultimately, however I feel that Animal is overpriced for what you get.  Furthermore, it seemed like every dish was a bit too oily for our liking.  We were about ready to pass out at the end because the food was so heavy.  The whole time I felt like I was eating fast food style grub in a high end restaurant.  Don't get me wrong, the service was great and the food was tasty, but I'm just not comfortable paying 29 dollars an entree for this type of food.  The appetizers, on the other hand are reasonably priced.  If I decide to go back, I'm definitely ordering 4-5 appetizers instead of 2 appetizers and 1 entree.

We had an absolutely wonderful experience at this place. I had my birthday dinner here on a sunday, and when we arrived around 6:30 no one was there. We had the restaurant to ourselves for a quite a while. Our waiter was so nice and informative. He explained what everything was and what his favorites were. We had pretty much every appetizer on the menu. They were all incredible! I usually hate foie gras but the baked foie gras on a biscuit with gravy was absolutely insane! The fried squash blossoms filled with Oaxacan cheese were great, as was the melted cheese dish with chorizo, garlic, and onions. Other dishes we had were the pork belly, marinated leeks and the balsamic glazed pork ribs. Some dishes were very complex, but even the simple fried hominy with lime was extremely tasty. All the food is really heavy and super rich, but its good food to splurge on once in a while. The dessert was fantastic. We had the famous chocolate bacon bar, which was good, but the white peach and mulberry crisp with whipped creme fraiche was out of this world good! We met the chefs and they were so nice. I wish my body could take eating this kind of food all the time because I would come here everyday. Since it can't though, this is definitely going to become one of my default restaurants for special occasions. Also, I noticed that some people complained that this place was too loud. Our waiter told us that this was a problem when they first opened, but since then they have put padding on the walls and installed this fish wire contraption on the ceiling. I think that both of these things probably help to absorb some of the sound.

great meal... we called 2 hours prior to get a reservation, and they were all booked... thought we'd take our chance for a bar table... when we get there, they had a few cancellations so we were seated right away... service was fantastic, very attentive and down-to-earth made you feel right at home... started with the pork belly kimchi...  i'm used to a pork belly cooked a little more well so i was a bit surprised when it was very soft, it was definitely a great dish, melted in your mouth... the kimchi wasn't really a kimchi but more like a picked medley of vegetables with peanuts... halibut and king crab was fantastic... the corn and gold rice went very well together... it had a bit of a kick which i enjoyed, believed it was a tabasco butter, definitely the highlight of my meal, the halibut was cooked perfectly... i'll definitely try to recreate the tabasco butter with corn and gold rice foie gras loco moco with spam and a quail egg.. it definitely wasn't loco moco i was used to... i did enjoy this dish; it was my first time having foie gras, which was everything i imagined it to be (from my experience with monkfish liver) however, the spam still tasted like spam, but i enjoyed the sauce/gravy which had a tang to it, almost like a hoisin sauce we finished the meal with the bacon chocolate crunch bar which caught my eye... it was way too chocolatey... i was very excited when i saw it, the salty, smokey, sweet... but then when i tried it, the chocolate was a bit too decadent for my tastes... it was the chocolate bar that was a bit too rich for me, but i'm not a big chocolate fan... it was surrounded by mousse which i did enjoy.

I feel guilty hating on this place. The atmosphere is cool and chic, very east coast, more minimal than the elaborate vibe that usually permeates the city's restaurant scene. It's on Fairfax by Canter's, which is sort of a weird cartoon-y area in the first place. Makes it all the more interesting. But, there's a trend in LA of things like calf brains and the cheek of pigs and it's a little much for me. Animal's all about this. I was taken here by a friend. There wasn't a lot I'd have eaten on the menu. I had a fish, I think Halibut, which was fine but a little over marinated. The Poutine (?) which my dining companion had was out of this world. The wine was okay. Wouldn't return, but it's nice if you want to freak people out a little.

My boyfriend took me to Animal for our anniversary dinner and I couldn't have been happier with his choice. The pork parade awaiting us had me excited for the weeks leading up to our reservation. We ordered 4 savory dishes and dessert. We started off with the baby broccoli and soft boiled egg..this was awesome! Even with minimal meat, this dish was packed with flavor and I wanted to soak up every droplet of the citrusy vinaigrette. With this dish as a preview of what was laying ahead of us, I knew we were in for a treat! Next up was the duck confit- amazing! like fried chicken but of duck and a side of greens with quince (I think) and nuts...really great. In between the duck and our gnocchi we spotted Top chef's Wolverine haired Marcel- so if Top Chef's eat there, you're in good company! Now let's talk about this gnocchi bolognese. Few pasta dishes leave me speechless, but alas- speechless I was. Speechless because I couldnt utter words while I was too busy savoring each ricotta goat cheese dumpling of heaven with meaty sauce and parmesan..unbelievable. I didn't really want to eat anything after that because nothing could be as delicious. But then out came the rabbit loin wrapped in prosciutto with a celery root purree. My boyfriend really liked this dish and while I loved the flavor, it was a little too rich for me and I was saving room for dessert, Joe's donuts smothered in caramel sauce. I'm a sucker for fresh hot donuts (try Grace's donuts, OMG!) and these did not disappoint! Caramel covered hot dough  tossed in sugar and cinamon. I want some now. This place was great and well worth our wait to check it out. I want to go back, now!

Full review and photos: http://twofoodiesonejour… Many restaurant names often have a meaning, like names of the owner or their place of origin but rarely does a restaurant name so clearly reflect the food you will experience: Animal in West Hollywood is one of these exceptions. From the very beginning this name makes it very clear that all kinds of animal protein will be the main focus of every dish - but everything else on the plate won't disappoint either. Animal was started in the spring of 2008 by chefs Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo. Both met in 1999 at culinary school at the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale and decided from there on to tackle the challenges of the culinary world together. After finishing their culinary education they worked together in numerous restaurants in Florida such as The Strand, Mark's and The River House before moving to the Wildflower restaurant at the Lodge in Vail. They then finally decided to move to Los Angeles to work under chefs Govind Armstrong and Ben Ford at the Chadwick Restaurant before opening their own catering service - Caramelized Productions. The catering service was also part of the short-lived Food Network series "Two Dudes Catering". Having experienced once how it is to work as their own bosses they decided to open their own restaurant - Animal. Animal is located on Fairfax Ave. in a non-descriptive building next to the Schwartz Bakery and a few buildings up from Canters. The interior has a very rustic, bare-bones and minimalistic look. It is a single large room with a bar at one end and several wooden tables. But similar to the food at Animal the first look might indicate a very bold and straight feel but if you look at bit closer you will find many small details like bare filament light bulbs and few pictures which make everything comfy and welcoming. The service at Animal is always professional but at the same time personal - at which restaurants do you experience waiters who recognize you and greet you with a handshake when you come into the restaurant?     Animal has an interesting list of wines with some more unusual finds like some Italians, e.g. Negramoro or Coste della Sesia. At a recent visit we decided to order a few beers including a Brother Thelonious Belgian Style Abbey Ale which had a malty start with a long sweet finish and an Abita Amber which is a nice smooth beer pairs nicely with the food at Animal. You can easily only just focus on several of the small plates of Animal to get a full meal but we tend to share a few of them before switching to the entrees (but not forgetting the desserts either). Small Plate 1: Chicken liver toast We really like chicken liver in all of its renditions. The night before we had the chicken liver toast at Pizzeria Mozza which has a more coarse structure whereas the Animal variation is very smooth with balsamic drippings on top. Small Plate 2: Rabbit loin, parsnip, pear mostarda and benton's bacon This plate has some ingredients you unfortunately don't see often on menus - rabbit which had a delicate taste between chicken and game wrapped in bacon which helped to keep it moist and parsnip which has a nice earth flavor. The pear mostarda (an Italian condiment made out of candies fruit and mustard flavored syrup) gave a good balance with its mix of sweetness and slight spicyness from the mustard oil. Small Plate 3: Duck confit, apple, pecans, dates and arugula Rather classic version of duck confit with carefully chosen sides - bitter greens, sweet dates, sour apples - which helped to cut through the richness of the meat. Perhaps not the best version of duck confit we ever had but definitely a very enjoyable one. Small Plate 4: Barbeque pork belly sandwiches and slaw. As certified pork belly addicts it is hard for us to see pork belly on a menu and not order it. Animal has several dishes on rotation and this time we chose the pork belly sandwiches - wonderfully tender meat with a not too overwhelming sauce and slaw on a tasty bun. Entrée 1: Flat iron steak, sunchoke hash and truffle parmesan fondue Very tender and perfectly cooked steak with an unusual but balanced sauce of truffles and parmesan which is quite addicting. The potatoes and sunchokes had a good smooth consistency. Entrée 2: Veal breast, polenta, savoy cabbage and prosciutto An Italian inspired dish which worked best if you tried to taste all the components at the same time. Dessert 1: Tres leches and dulce de leche An outstanding tres leches cake which even though it is quite rich is at the same time very light. The dulce de leche adds a interesting caramel-like flavor. Dessert 2: Bacon chocolate crunch bar and s&p anglaise a Kit-Kat bar but with added saltiness from the bacon which could have been a bit more pronounced. You mainly taste the good chocolate-nut combination. We have yet to have a disappointing evening at Animal.

The food was not very good here. We're writing this review as we suffer from a heartburn and a stomach ache. We think the meat was either undercooked or not fresh. Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is neat, but there's nothing special to say about the food, other than the fact that its overpriced and lacks the right touch. For instance, the sauces used on the dishes (we ordered the duck heart and the foie grois locco moco) were great but somehow didn't really match up well with the actual meat.The only dish we enjoyed was the pork belly sandwich, but it's nothing that special and we wouldn't come back for it. Overall, we give it two stars: one for the food and one for the service.

Holy Moly. what to say about Animal? That perhaps it is THE BEST MEAL I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. no joke. the restaurant is totally unassuming. it's very small and you would easily walk right past it without noticing it.  The server was very friendly and helpful and knew about the food. He suggested that we get 4 appetizers and 1 meal to share. so we did. we got: pork belly, kimchi, peanuts, chili soy, scallion -pork belly is bacon before it is sliced. so it's like bacon steak. Steacon. the kimchi was amazing and i love food that has peanuts in it. rabbit loin, pancetta, carrots, favas, chili -the presentation was a little weird on this one. it looked like a weiner on julienne carrots and chilis. the flavor was good but it wasn't my favorite. quail fry, grits, slab bacon, chard, maple jus -this was incredible. the quail was done like fried chicken and we slopped it around in the grits and maple jus and licked our fingers clean. foie gras, biscuit, maple sausage gravy -this was probably my favorite. the foie gras was done perfectly. it absolutely melted in my mouth. the biscuit was flaky and absorbed the maple sausage gravy like a delicious edible sponge. for our meal we shared: flat iron, potato, mousserons, truffle parmesan fondue -this is the flavor i kept burping up the rest of the night and i enjoyed the hell out of it. we ordered the steak medium rare but next time i might go for rare. it was so tender and juicy and flavorful. and for dessert we got: pound cake, strawberries, cream -a sweet way to end our meal. we waddled out of there like two fat pregnant ladies with our stomaches protruding in front of us. we never felt rushed or pushed or anything. it was one of those meals where we were rolling our eyes and exclaiming with joy over every single bite. My only negative point is in regards to the wine.  It seemed as though every bottle we tried to order was already opened or had just been opened by another server.  Hence, we had to buy it by the glass or caraffe.  I ended up spending $90 (half the cost of the  entire meal) in wine alone.  Save yourself the trouble and bring your own.  it's worth the $20 corkage fee.

That was one great meal! I am going to dream about the Poutine forever. The Crispy Hominy has changed my relationship with those little white nuggets. All hominy should be deep friend and doused with lime. The Pork Belly Sliders were delicious! Everything was sososo good. Waiter was helpful with wine, smart and accommodating. Can I go back tomorrow?

Most of the reviews are correct, the food is good, some of it really good. The main issue with Animal was our server Jeff who failed to fill our water, change our plates, taking 15 minutes to bring us the menu for dessert and the dropping the check off nonchalantly during dessert. I understand its a low key place, but simple things like very poor service can ruin an evening. Lets get on with the food. We had pig ears, kale salad, liver toast, poutine, loco moco, and the sliders. The pig ears and sliders were the highlights BY FAR. Excellent flavor and creativity. Liver toast was good as well. The poutine was too heavy and the loco moco was good but not great. The hamburger meat really didn't add anything to the dish but the fois gras was awesome. We also had the chocolate bar and tres leche desserts which were good, not amazing. Overall, I'm just starting to think that Southern CA isnt that concerned with service because back to back bad service nights at Bazaar and Animal have not left me feeling wanted. At least Animal's food was good enough to endure the bad server.

I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. Perfect place! The food was amazing! I recommend the gnocchi, the fries in Ox Tail gravy, and the rack of ribs. The yellow tail was delicious as well and showed us this place was more than a one trick pony. The wine was wonderful. Our waiter, Jeff (I believe) gave us tastes when we couldn't make up our minds about the wine and big pours after we did. He was very helpful and made excellent suggestions for dinner.  We will definitely be going back! Once we finish the leftovers...

Came here for my birthday the other night. The food was outstanding as was the service. We arrived a tad early, so i knew we'd wait a bit. And although we were sat 15 min later than the rez, it was fine, because this place is all about savoring the experience. The dishes are expertly paced and our waiter did an excellent job of ordering them. My guess was in terms of richness, least to most. We started with the Quail Fry. tasty, but not exciting. Still, like i mentioned, there was a build-up happening here. Then the Rabbit. wow. If I didn't already love rabbit, i do now. Then the infamous pork belly sandwiches. see other reviews because there is no need to be redundant. And finally, the Foie Gras. Holy smokes, eating this dish is a phenomenal experience. The food is rich, but the portions are small. The wine is good, but you can bring your own for only a $20 corkage. The staff is friendly, but not overly so. And the decor is minimal, but warm. Nice art, too. Go to animal. The name is a bit twisted, but your stomach never will be.

if you order a menu item called Sweet Bread and it comes with creamed  spinach, capers, and other veggie, DO NOT BE SURPRISED WHEN IT COMES OUT AND IT'S MEAT! seriously. i've been to animal before and had no issues whatsoever sticking with veggies and fish. thought we were doing the same thing last night when we were served ORGANS. seriously, sweet bread = organs? they need to put that on the menu, not surprise semi vegetarians with it.   other than that, the food was fine. not worth the money we spent as far as i'm concerned, especially after the sweet bread incident.

Someone here compared Animal's pork belly sliders to Momofuku's steamed buns, which makes perfect sense to me.  Both are among the most delicious, rich, and memorable things you can put in your mouth.  I think it's a toss up between the two.  I was dying to try the foie gras biscuits and gravy here; while it didn't disappoint, per se, it wasn't 'amazing' and could be passed on in my opinion (especially for the price).  I'm willing to pay for foie, but it was a little overpowered by everything else in the dish (although delicious and a cool idea).   Two of us shared about 6 small plates, and everything was great.  We expected to order the bacon dessert, but once we finished our plates, I was concerned we might both have a heart attack in the restaurant, so we passed.  Service was great, not pushy and very informed.  Overall, it's nice to see quality places doing delicious innovative dishes for a reasonable price.  I can't wait to go back.

The menu is a bit off-putting at times... refereferring to fries with oxtail and cheddar as poutine is definitely a bit pretentious, especially since they then have to explain what's in the dish - and do sort of give away in that explanation that it's not a classic poutine. That, and there's no sign outside, AND the waitstaff will rudely tell you, not ask you, to leave if you walk in at 5:59 because "we don't open until 6." If you can get past THAT... Well, then you'll love this place. Honestly, at the end of my meal I couldn't have cared less about the pretense and the attitude. Also, once you're finally seated, they're very accommodating. Our waiter was fun and had a great time with us... but the food. Oh man the food. It's GOOD. It's medium-to-small portions so my suggestion is that you should go with a group and share a bunch of plates. But, at the very least, my suggestion is that you should go.

Went there the first time for my birthday and haven't stopped talking about the food.  The 6 hour bolognese over polenta was amazing and the foie gras with the maple sausage gravy... truly sublime.   I could seriously eat the foie gras everyday if fat and calories weren't an issue.  I had the branzino that was perfectly prepared and just melted in your mouth. The perfect meal ended with the most heavenly dessert of freshly made donuts with a caramel sauce that I would have licked off the plate.

Man this place isn't for the faint of heart, almost everything on the menu is geared for heavy eaters, and everything is in your face, over the top- not much is delicate here so you won't get any respite from dishes drenched in sauces, extreme/bold flavor, or covered in cheeses or bacon.  I really enjoyed dinner.  BUT, I was celebrating an occasion and was buzzed from alcohol so when there were times that i noticed the food was really slow to come out, it didnt bother me.  Nor did i have to pay, so i didnt factor the cost. The place is loud and casual, and the food is hearty, comforting, it sorta felt wrong eating it in warm weather SoCal.   The hominy was a great snack, like a cross between karaage and chichacorn- the nice corn flavor, but battered and with a tender interior.  The poutine was good, not great.  There was wayyy to much gravy and meat on the fries, so as weird as it seems, the cheddar seemed to be missing and the fries got soggy fast.  I was already feeling sluggish and tired after the two appetizers.   I was nervously excited and ashamed for ordering it, in the end the loco moco turned out pretty good.  The fois gras seemed like it was added just for a wow factor.  Even after engineering a portioned bite, the hamburger and spam dominated.  The bed of rice was good, it had a garnish of sriracha literally straight from the bottle (which could be interpreted as cheating) that i liked.   I tasted the flat iron, it was cooked nicely (med-rare) and drenched in the thick musty truffle fondue, which i really liked.  It had little fingerlings that were good for drenching up the sauce.   The chocolate bar was great, it reminded me of a ferrero rocher sans wafer and in bar form.  I liked the bacon, it was a little smoky, and was nice. After eating all that, i was just compelled to talk a long walk on fairfax and get fresh air. It was good overall, and i'd go back.

I can't compliment this place enough.  Everything was great, from the food to the wine to the service.  As a suggestion from our server, we decided to order several dishes and share so that we could taste as much as possible.  We decided on the pig ear, barbeque pork belly sandwiches, ricotta and goat cheese gnocchi, smoked trout, sweetbreads, and foie gras.  Our server was especially helpful in pairing the dishes for us by starting us out with the lighter dishes and working up towards the heavier ones before coming back down so that we were ready for dessert.  Every dish we ordered was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection.  The pinot noir that we ordered was excellent, complimenting our entire meal very well.  Our dessert (brown butter berry tart and bacon chocolate crunch bar) was the perfect ending to the meal.  The tart was warm and savory, each bite melting in your mouth.  The crunch bar was rich in chocolate and so very decadent.  It really is no wonder why ANIMAL is always packed.

Animal's food is good to very good, but there's a serious attitude problem here.  Staff acts as if they are doing you a very big favor to allow you to eat in their restaurant.  Don't ask for change to feed your meter; they will refuse.  (Apparently they really want you to pay that valet fee.)  Wine prices -- bottles ($50-$120) and by the glass (most are $15) -- are ludicrous.  C'mon, Animal, can't you find a bottle or two that you can sell for $32, $36, or $40?  You're probably better off taking your own and paying the $20 corkage fee.  Seven bucks for a bottle of Pelegrino.  Duck confit is very good -- perfect crispy skin and the slivered dates add just the right touch of sweetness.  Poundcake on the dessert menu isn't pound cake at all, but a very nice strawberry shortcake with warm, sugar-dusted biscuit and perfectly whipped cream.

well over 24 hours later, and i think i'm still suffering from the food hangover i got with Azuré, Eimi, and Roo. this restaurant is a true celebration of meat. everything i had was good/great/awesome/legen.... wait for it... dary. the staff is extremely friendly, knowledgable, and more than willing to help you when you're stumped on what to order. from the bbq sliders to the crispy hominy, there isn't a misstep on the menu. the chefs have me thoroughly convinced that adding a perfectly seared piece of foie gras will elevate nearly any dish to unheard of levels. loco moco? toss some foie gras on it and wonder why you never thought of doing such a thing before. biscuit and gravy? layer some foie on top and try to contain yourself as your eyes roll into the back of your head in culinary ecstacy (ok maybe that was just roo). the deserts, thankfully, were without foie gras, but still great. i'll definitely be back for more.

Just came home from dinner at Animal.  We went for my wife's birthday.  While some of the dishes were all we expected and them some, overall, we were a bit disappointed considering the hype.  We picked 5 dishes, with our waitress advising us.  The first dish, a hamachi tostada, was quite good, bordering on wonderful.  The second dish, a baby kale salad, wasn't.  Our main complaint is that the kale salad was so salty that out palate never really recovered in time to enjoy the rest of the dishes.  A pasta dish with lamb sausage was good, but not great.  My wife had been in the mood for seared foie gras since before we made reservations, so we ordered the foie gras and biscuit with maple sausage gravy.  If we had had the biscuit and gravy, minus the foie gras with a cup of coffee, it would have made a fine breakfast.  Add a single, thin slice of foie gras, and charge $23, and  you might as well use a gun to rob us.  The maple sausage gravy completely overpowered the delicate and in this case, almost tasteless foie gras.  All of this was could almost be forgiven, as the flatiron steak was fabulous - a high quality version of this not so fancy cut, prepared perfectly.  Nonetheless, the quality of this dish alone is not enough to bring us back anytime soon.

This place was more like a meat-eating paradise! Not the healthiest of meals I have had but everyone is allowed a cheat day right? Everything we had was Amazing! I'll start with Appy's: Pork Belly which still sounds pretty gross but the best way I can describe it is having a really thick piece of bacon that sinfully melts in your mouth! We also had Petit Basque with thinly sliced chorizo & garlic bread - REALLY GOOD!! For main course I had fried quail with the most amazing grits I have ever tasted! They had sort of a maple gravy to go along with the dish that complimented the quail really well! I honestly don't remember what my friend had but it must have been good as she didn't share! :) And finally for dessert we had Tres Leche cake that would make any Hispanic mother proud yet jealous of how good it was!! Last but certainly not least we had Joe's doughnuts that had the perfect amount of apple caramel glaze over them. Highly recommend Animal!

this definitely goes on my list of favorite restaurants in la.  great food, great service.  i'm always mentally preparing myself for pretentious servers whenever i go to a restaurant in the hipster area of town.  but our waiter was anything but pretentious.  extremely friendly, and helpful and gave us the best recommendations.  the ambiance of the restaurant celebrates minimalism which i love.  the main focus of attention is really the food and the wine is great.  we will definitely be coming back here again.

My husband & I went to eat at Animal @ 6:30 PM.  They could not accommodate us with out reservations.  There wasn't even room to sit at the bar.  The hostess was perfectly sweet and polite in telling us.  Not being rude, there just wasn't any room or anything she could do.  After hanging out and begging her she said "you know, you could stand up and eat at the end of the bar."  We look at each other and thought this is our romantic night (well almost night time) away from our kids?  We decided to go stand and order our meal.  First we had a great salad.  Then, mmmm the slow cooked bolognese sauce.  I had steak that was so good!  Melted in my mouth.  Also what was cool is, like a peep show, I could see the cooks tatted arms at work.  From what the bartender told us, the 2 owner / chefs all always hands on and perfectionist.  Not a plate leaves the kitchen with out being okayed by one of the on duty owners.  Oh and how can I forget the donuts.  These were amazing!!!!  They said something in the air made them rise just perfectly.  What a great place, vibe, meal and night.

i don't understand how not everyone has given this restaurant five stars, because i've been to most of the nice restaurants in LA, but this one definitely stands out in my mind. once in a blue moon, you come across a dish that changes you forever after your having tried it. it's rare, but it happens, and at this restaurant, it happened twice. the seared foie gras atop a biscuit with maple syrup gravy is divine, as is the fried pork belly on a kimchi slaw.
