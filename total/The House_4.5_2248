Thank you Yelpers, all your reviews are great and so true! The House was amazing. Although it is small, they have a small selection but a very good selection. Whether you're looking for seafood, noodle dish, etc. They should have one dish that will culminate your craving. Not to mention, they are fast! The food came out quick, the presentation was great, and I never inhaled a dish so fast in my life. I ordered the Wasabi noodles with the flank steak, and the meat was moist and the noodles were cooked to perfection. Make sure to make reservations in advance because it gets packed! I went at 9pm on a Sunday night and there was still a line out the door.

This is a small place, so I recommend reservations! It fills up quickly, so even if you get there early like we did and it feels empty, don't worry. The menu is fairly extensive with lots of yummy-sounding dishes (there were yummy specials that night, too!). The whole feel of the place is super different from the food. The food is a little fancy and so good, but it feels like a dressed-up hole in the wall joint. There are steak, seafood, and chicken (but no vegetarian) dishes to choose from. I can be a bit picky in food I like, but there were multiple dishes I would have liked. I ended up getting a mushroom dish that was really tasty. We were absolutely stuffed when we left, but enjoyed the natural light flowing it the big window, the simply-decorated tables and the courteous service.

All that hype and 1-hr wait for my walk-in! Finally I made it and had a great meal. Following the popular recommendation, I ordered the sea bass with garlic noodles and it came with stir fried beans on the side. Delish and very well made! The fish was cooked to perfection and came with some additional dipping sauce on the side. I love it when sauce is on the side and my food isn't dipped in it! Garlic noodles and beans were amazing too. MUST ORDER - the tapioca-mango pudding. I am a big tapioca fan and this is one of the best I have ever had. Can't wait to be back to try more yummy-ness. On the downside, everything is excellent, but the wait and prices may not be 100% justified. For the same price, you could probably get more gourmet stuff. But this place is still worth a try.

Hip little spot in North Beach. The staff was able to change our reservation last minute, so that was pleasing. It's true - it's a fusion spot - not traditional by any means. It's a great place to share lots of dishes. The decor is somewhat simple, not too overwhelming aesthetically. Note: Super hard to find parking!

Love how the restaurant and menu is simple and unpretentious yet the food is touched with gourmetness...presented beautifully AND tastes even better than it looks. Delicious flavor - especially all the sauces! Oh the sauces. And, A+ for cooking every dish perfectly. Tried the ever famous grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy...it was grilled perfectly, and still really tender (my bf - the usual steak eater - insisted that we both order our own sea bass because he didn't want to share his with me). It was an impressive portion of fish and the tangy garlic ginger soy was really good. The sauteed snap peas it came with were extra crunchy just how I like it...but the garlic noodles could use a lot more garlic and less softness (and I could not taste any wasabi in the noodles either?) I'll go with the rice next time (which was firm just the way I like it). The asparagus appetizer surprised both of us...we were expecting warm, cooked asparagus but out came a bowl of cooked, but cold asparagus cut into bite sized pieces, in a DELICIOUS roasted sesame sauce and with some orange crunchy stuff. Very refreshing. We also go the seared scallops (also in some kind of delicious, buttery sauce). Came on a Sunday evening at around 6pm, and even though there is very limited seating...hooray there was no wait! Our food came out really fast too - within 15 minutes of ordering. Usually fusion food is mediocre but The House is anything but. Totally exceeded my expectations!

The House was able to seat my 11-person party super-last minute, so they get points for that. Unfortunately we ended up waiting about 40 minutes past our reservation time in their ultra-cramped 'entry' area (that's really just the only few square feet without a table). I had the crispy salmon roll to start, which was predictably tasty. My entree was the other salmon dish, a sesame soy glazed fillet. It was pretty good--though the girl next to me absolutely loved the bonito sake broth under the fillet. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their dishes, and I was amused how many of them seemed to incorporate the housemade kimchi into the presentation. It seemed a little odd flavorwise, but who am I to question the chef! Service was good, although there were a couple issues with the bill at the end (which they took care of). Definitely a nice place, especially for a date.

I'll give this place a 3.5 The Deep-fried salmon roll not bad, pretty good with the chinese hot mustard. I had the seabass with ginger soy, Wasabi noodles with steak. The taste wasn't bad but nothing much special. 1 starter, 2 entree $60 for 2 people. All I could say is, the food is not bad but nothing too special and a little bit over price. The restaurant is pretty small so it gets loud which you can't really talk.

This was my second time eating here, this time with my hubby for an early anniversary. The food was still good; I got the grilled sea bass with ginger soy and garlic noodles and the hubby got the pork chop in pomegranate sauce, with both dishes being delicious. I think I enjoyed his pork chop more as it was very tender, juicy and not over cooked. We also split the fried salmon appetizer, which was delicious, except for the wasabi dipping sauce it came with. It was just too strong and neither of us can really stand wasabi. For dessert we decided to split the mango tapioca and the coconut creme brule with passion fruit sauce. I have to say I was under-impressed this time with the latter, as the first time I had it you could taste the coconut in the creme brule more as well as more passionfruit puree. The mango tapioca was cold, creamy and refreshing though. I was just a little disappointed though that after stating we were celebrating our anniversary, other than a candle glued onto the plate of our dessert, nothing was really said to us or written out on the plate. I am wondering how they would even acknowledge someone's special occasion if they didn't order dessert..stick a candle on your check? Otherwise, if nothing is complimentary, there is really no point in leaving a note when making reservations. I'm sorry, The House, while serving really delicious and upscale food for reasonable prices, has missed it's mark this time around with the service being a little inattentive (we came right at 11:30am when they opened and only 2 other tables were there) and not really putting in much effort in the anniversary presentation, given that we were charged for both desserts, even writing out happy birthday in chocolate syrup in addition to an awkwardly placed candle would have been a nice gesture for choosing to celebrate with them. Overall, I would still come back for the food but perhaps not for something like an anniversary. Definitely get the pork chop if you can't decide and the Tuna Ahi Tartar, which wasn't on the menu this time or a special, but something I enjoyed a great deal with first time I dined here. Driving around this area is probably the worst, so try to take public transit or stick with a weekday during lunch. There is parking in the North Beach garage a few blocks away for $3.00 an hour.

Optimally I would give The House a 3.5, 3 seems a little too harsh but a 4 is over-complimenting. I got the Kurobuta pork chop, calamari ahi tuna tartare, tried some of the sea bass and had the chocolate cake. Everything was delicious, but nothing was particularly memorable. The ahi tuna and chocolate cake were probably the only two dishes that were worth their prices. I also had some of the lychee iced tea, which was literally Êjust a single lychee in a glass of iced tea. Nothing special. All in all, I wouldn't say that The House is a must-try. It's good for groups (make sure you make a reservation though!) and a pretty casual restaurant with decent food for exorbitant prices. I'd probably go again, but not often.

I. Love. the. House. Ê My favorite little jem of a restaurant. ÊJust a step away from the tourist traps along Columbus and completely unassuming in exterior appearance, the place never disappoints. ÊThe menu hasn't changed significantly over the past couple of years but each dish is outstanding...fresh ingredients and always tasty dishes...you can't leave a plate without swiping up every drop of sauce and yummy garnish. Ê Yes, even the garnishes are worth savoring! ÊI've pretty much decided that I'll walk in and blindly accept whatever they have as the daily special. ÊThey're THAT consistent in quality. Ê(as an aside: when in season, the soft shell crab is out of this world. ÊBBQ oysters *drool) I've been crazy about this place for a few years and now it has added sentimental value (first date with the BF)... the BF is now a huge fan! warning: make a reservation! the place is small and doesn't have any space in the front for patrons to wait comfortably (although folks do crowd at the entry and have to suffer seeing all the scrumptious dishes within arm's reach, while they wait for a table) P.S. Êalso dig the little 'house' cutouts in the paper place mats :)

As the majority of San Franciscans, I am a foodie! Period! Not to say I am obese, but food makes me happy, and The House is definitely a place to make anyone happy. Where to start? Better yet, where not to start; the menu is small but encompasses different dishes to satisfy you pallet. Having gone two weekends in a row, I have to admit, the food did not lose it ground. Having their weekend special of kobe beef with truffel sauce was spectacular... First off, the salmon rolls- delicate, great texture, simply delicious. I recommend this dish if you love seafood. Deep fried chicken liver with baby greens....spectacular. Not a huge fan of chicken liver, but this is more of a salad than anything and the touch of vinaigrette sauce adds the simplicity to cut the grease (little of what there is) from the chicken liver. In simple form, elegant chicken nuggets with salad. Crab cakes....flaky and moist....the sauce compliments it perfectly. Had two other appetizers but too much to describe. Main course: Rib-eye vs. kobe beef..... winner: rib-eye. I had the kobe beek while my brother ordered the rib-eye (not a big fan of rib-eye) but the piece I did try off his place was incredible. It completely changed my mind about ribeye....another contender to the challenge is the kurobuta pork chop, unfortunately they ran out on the second weekend I went, but awesome; highly recommend it to pork lovers. Recommendation to anyone, make reservation... small casual spot but food is awesome, bit on the pricey side for how casual patrons dress.

*droooooooooooool* Ê I came here for lunch with my boyfriend & it was worth every penny (that..we didn't pay). Our close friends kidnapped us & dropped us off outside The House with an envelope of money & reservations already made. They're so sweet. (: They knew I was dying to try this place & they made it happen! I ordered the Kurobuta Pork Chop while my boy ordered the Sea Bass. Both were...to die for. The first bite I took...I can't even describe. :X The Pork was tender & the pomegranate sauce that it came with was absolutely divine. Everything about this entree was AMAZING. My boyfriend's sea bass was super buttery & flaky & extremely well prepared. Lunch is much lighter on the wallet than their dinner, but I would pay their prices for dinner any day. The ambiance is small, but it adds to the cuteness. (: Make sure you make a reservation!

one of the BEST restaurants in SF for sure / HANDS DOWN!! These people know what they are doing. They keep their reservations really organized and it is a must to have a reservation here, otherwise the waiting list could take forever... this is a tiny gem in the middle of North Beach. Cannot say enough about their plates execution, every sauce, every texture kinda melts in your mouth... it is just delicious and flavorful. Gotta try the Ahi Tuna, or mussels, and the salmon roll to start off. On the entree side my faves are the sea bass, the pomegranate pork chop.... They also have Kobe Steak as part of their specials. They cook the beef to perfection medium rare, omg! DAMN, everything here is to die for. I am not the biggest fan of tapioca, and gosh.... the mango tapioca was outstanding at The House. I highly recommend this restaurant, wont disappoint, especially locals.

I don't get why this place was rated so high and how it was so packed I could only get a 9PM reservation day of. I tried the sea bass, pork chop, and salmon roll. They were all good, but not super amazing. The sea bass was definitely on point. It was cooked well and had a great flavor, I preferred this over the pork chop, which was also good, but why is the menu so small if you can't NAIL the dish? The salmon roll I think is what really kind of just pissed me off about the whole thing. Yelp failed me on this recommendation horribly. I did not think this was a good dish at all. It was just a piece of well cooked salmon in a deep fried roll. I used all of the horseradish sauce to make it actually tasty. Bottom line for me: There are a ton of other restaurants in the area you could drop $25-40/person that would be WAY better.

One of the best meals I've ever had! Such unique flavors and everything was perfectly cooked! Knowing how good the food was, DD made a reservation weeks in advance and we were seated right away when we arrived. Score! --Ahi Tuna Tartare ($10)-- To start we started off with something light. Tuna was delicious, fresh, well seasoned and beautifully presented. My only complaint was the extremely small portion! --Chilean Sea Bass with Garlic Noodles ($26)-- I LOVE sea bass! And this one was melt-in-your-mouth delicious! Soft, flaky, flavorful, buttery - just perfect! Comes with a nice portion of sauteed green beans and a choice of rice or garlic noodles. GET THE GARLIC NOODLES - chewy and flavorful! --Braised Pork Shoulder ($28)-- DD loves braised, slow-cooked meat and ordered this pork shoulder dish - a special that night. He was presented with a big bowl filled with a spicy cream sauce. In the middle of the bowl was a nicely sized piece of braised pork shoulder topped with a fried pork brine. The soup just by itself I could have drank! The flavors in this dish were unique and delicious - the perfect balance between spicy and creamy. The meat was fall-apart soft and we devoured it completely. DD said it was one of the best dishes he's ever had - I totally agree. Even better than the Sea Bass! All in all, we left blown away by our meal! Servers were prompt and well informed about the food. Only thing sort of UNDERwhelming was our Ahi Tuna appetizer. Next time we'll try the fried calamari - which looked awesome! EASY 5 stars!

Like many other great eateries here in the city, The House is literally like eating at someone's house. There isn't much seating available so make sure to make your reservations ahead of time. We came here for a friend's birthday on a Sunday night and yes, it was a full house. Everything we ordered was fairly good if not delicious. For starters we had the salmon rolls which were fried in wonton wrappers and served with a hot chinese mustard. I'm not a big fan of hot mustard so I thought this dish was ok. The calamari and tuna tartare were both good. For our main courses, most got the sea bass, but I got the cod which was an excellent decision on my side. I tasted the sea bass and definitely liked the melt in your mouth cod better. Sea bass has a tougher meat. The cod comes atop a bed of greens and sliced california rolls. I would like to come back to try the halibut with mushroom orzo. This restaurant is definitely on the higher-end fusion side, so do expect to pay $30+ per person. Worth it though!

Has become one of my faves in and out of the hood! Has high end food quality with the tuck away vibe that is so SF! Had the sea bass on a previous visit and it's prepared perfectly but the sauce is very typical to asian fusion. Good for those that do not like to explore their culinary taste buds. Last visit, Waitress verbalized a loooooong list of specials that my date and I were testing our memory banks to remember them all. So we had the scallop app special and Hamachi entree special! Still thinking about both dishes! Scallops were 3 or 4 on a plate (can't remember)! Doesn't matter because I just may order anything scallop at House moving forward! Fabulosity! Hamachi was really beautifully presented and fabulously prepared! My date liked my dish better than his (maybe because he ordered steak!), so I was nice enough to share:-) Good thing he was cute!

OH MY GOD. This is definitely one of the most amazing restaurants in San Francisco. And if you disagree, then you need to try their sea bass. TRUST ME! IT WILL CHANGE YOUR MIND. And maybe even your life. The sea bass is literally melt in your mouth, delicious, I've-died-and-gone-to-heaven goodness! I've had a lot of freakin' sea bass in my life. Mainly the sea bass you get from dad's fresh fishing, or your good old Chinese restaurant. I've had some good. I've had some bad. But this.... is UNBELIEVABLE. End of story. Well, not quite the end of the story just yet. I think we need to rewind just a little bit. I've been hearing about this place for more than just a while now. The shitty parking is what's been keeping me away. Also, I'm not the biggest fan of calling in reservations. I'm more of an opentable snob. So when I called in and got somewhat of a rude and rushed attitude, I was pretty sure I'd dock them down a point or two with my review. We ended up making reservations for 6:30 (5 days ahead of time), which we then had to change to a later time (the day of our dinner reservation). The soonest table available for reservations was 8:30, so we went with that. We were told that we could try coming in earlier and potentially getting in sooner than that. So when we got there a bit past 7:00pm, we went up to one of the ladies at the desk what happened, and she immediately remembered my name. Plus plus ++ She put me on the expedited waitlist and said it would be about 20 minutes. We had to wait in the cold for approximately 5 minutes before she came to grab us. Not bad! Plus plus ++ again! We ordered the crab cakes, asparagus, rib eye, sea bass with garlic noodles, and then added the order of tuna tartar afterwards. I also got myself some chrysanthemum tea! The asparagus was amazing. Mmmmmm... I could've used a 2nd bowl probably. The seasoning and sauce was just perfection. It was crunchy and fresh. And I know we've all had crappy asparagus where we had to spit the remains out before. Not here at The House; not here. The crab cake was delicious! Not too fried or crunchy, just the way I like it. I probably could have had the whole thing to myself too! I tried a bit of the rib eye, which was good. But the sea bass stole the show, and my dining companion could only agree. Trying to describe it any further would still do it no justice, so PLEASE try for yourself and see! The garlic noodles that came with it was also amazing; not dry at all. The flavors, texture, and colors just combined perfectly! Mid way through the dinner, we decided to also order the tuna tartar. This would be the only dish we could've done without. I personally felt that it was under-seasoned and kind of bland. This is the only item I would not order again. But back to the fabulous dinner! Everything else was truly amazing and of very high quality. We did not have too much room for dessert after 3 appetizers and 2 entrees between us 2. I would love to try some next time though! I saw a mix of people here, with many Asians included. I'm gonna be real here. Most times when you read up on a place that is Asian, or Asian fusion, you arrive to find many many customers (but without an Asian in sight). The House is different. I saw Asian people here! The Chinese family that sat next to us spoke the language too, and appeared to have been here before. So no, this is not just good Asian/Asian fusion for white people. It's good for Asian people too. ABCs! Take your families here! They will be impressed! Super excited to come back. Will definitely call in to make the reservation. And although I'm usually the type of try different dishes on a different visit, I will definitely order the sea bass again. The food was soooo amazing that I decided not to take off any points from the first phone encounter I had.

My roommate and I decided to come here after seeing the large number of 5-star reviews. It surely did not disappoint. This is what we ordered: Appetizers: the scallops and spicy sashimi and avocado. These were the specials for the night so it's unclear that they will always be on the menu. Entrees: Tuna and wasabi noodles and flat iron steak. Desserts: Key lime pie with blueberries and cream and the coconut creme brulee with passion fruit compote. Overall, the dishes were incredibly well balanced: the flavor profiles, portion size, textures, and presentation. Clearly, this is a restaurant that pays great attention to detail and allows the food to stand on its own. The service was always extremely efficient (fast, though not hurried). The ambience is relatively quiet, though there is a slight sense of crowdedness given the small size of the restaurant. Nonetheless, an easy 5-stars!

Let's just get to the point. For appetizers, we had the mussels, deep fried salmon roll, and shrimp dumplings. ÊI enjoyed the mussels and especially the tomato butter broth, however, the mussels were quite small. ÊThe deep fried salmon roll was perfectly cooked and not dry at all. ÊThe shrimp dumplings was my least favorite appetizer because they just tasted like any other dumplings. ÊYes, it was good but there is really nothing special about it that you can't find elsewhere. Our entrees included the sea bass and miso cod. ÊThe sea bass was definitely the better of the two. ÊFlavor-wise, it was pretty simple, but what made it stood out was how it was cooked perfectly. ÊThe accompaniments, however, were less than impressive. ÊThe chinese green beans and garlic noodles were overdressed with soy sauce/oyster sauce. ÊIt was heavy, greasy, and really just a bad attempt at asian fusion. ÊThe miso cod was super soft and moist, but that entire dish was ruined by the soy/miso sauce that it came with. ÊThe cod sat on top of cauliflower that was completely drowned in this sauce. ÊIt was difficult to eat because the sauce was just too overwhelming. I really hate it when asian dishes are drowned in a teriyaki-ish sauce. ÊThe appetizers were great, the piece of sea bass was delicious, but everything else... I would not care to have again.

Thank you Yelp for helping me find this restaurant. ÊOur vacation to SF was made so much better thanks to great food at the House. Reservations are a must but we were able to get a 7pm Saturday table calling about 10 days in advance. ÊVery small place and the food comes quickly but we did not feel rushed. We had the crab cake appetizer followed by sea bass and pork chop entrees - both equally fantastic, cooked perfectly with great flavor from the sauces.

What a bland unassuming name for a place that packs so much. So much flavor. So many people. So much noise? True, the acoustics are no good in this small space, but unless someone in your party has a hearing impairment or doesn't operate above 10 dB, then, game on. Decibel levels aside, the food is loud. Portions are quite generous, yet licking the plate is irresistible. Dishes are well plated, but not too artistic that you don't feel bad attacking it. Flavors are intense, savory, sweet, balanced. For a place that specializes in Asian Fusion seafood, they do non-fish quite well. Vegetarians need not apply.

What can I say that hasn't already been said? The House ROCKS. We were sat within 5 minutes for our 8:00 p.m. reservation. We took some Yelpers' recommendations and ordered the scallops appetizers - sooo delicious and perfectly cooked, they almost melted in our mouths. For entrees, I had the seabass and my date had the flat iron steak. Both were amazing. The only downside of the meal was the Pinot Noir from Oregon($65) that the waitress recommended. But we both thought the price-to-quality ratio was not great. Overall, this place is HOT right now, and rightly so. Can't wait to go back!!

This is a must try restaurant. ÊSea bass and Cod are definitely my favorites. ÊIt's hard to describe. ÊThe flavors are so subtle and extreme at the same time. ÊThe fish is beautifully seared, and very moist and flaky inside. Ê Made reservations and was seated right when we walked in. ÊI told the waitress to bring out the dishes as soon as they were ready. ÊBig mistake on my part, I had no idea the kitchen staff was so efficient. ÊMinutes after ordering, our table was covered with the 6 dishes we ordered. ÊWe couldn't eat fast enough. ÊI help going back between the sea bass, cod, and skirt steak. Advice: avoid the scallop salad. ÊIt's made with the small fried baby scallops.

I came here a few years ago after my friends raved about it. ÊI was disappointed with the "Asian Fusion food" and haven't been back. ÊLast week, I happened to come here b/c the original dining choice I had was actually closed for renovation. ÊComing in as a walk-in, I expected to wait, and was told it would be around 20 mins - not bad for a walk-in. Ê20 mins had gone by, then another 20 mins and another 20 mins, and finally after 1+hr, me/friend got our table. Ê Well, I am not complaining.. but I am just stating the fact. Appetizers: - Seared Scallops: one of the specials of the night. ÊFor some people this might have been on the raw side, but for me it was perfect. Ê - Deep Fried Salmon Roll was goood!!! Main Course: - Sea Bass with Wasabi Noodle was perfectly done - Seared White Tuna (one of the specials of the night again), it was decent but not the best. ÊThe California (?) roll that came with it was good though. Ê I would say this time around, I have changed my mind about the food at this restaurant. ÊI am a little torn between giving it a 3 or a 4 stars. ÊThe food is good, but the restaurant is small, the plates are a little lacking, and parking sucks in that neighborhood! Ê Oh, almost forgot.. they actually have a few interesting Japanese Beer choices. ÊOk, that did it to boost my rating to 4 stars.

The House has become one of my favorite restaurant destinations. Make sure you get a reservation a few days in advance because it does get overly crowded at the restaurant and getting a table is quite difficult unless you arrive there right when the doors open. Reservations are held up to 15 minutes and trust me, those extra 15 minutes count because finding parking in North Beach is a pain. The restaurant is small and cramped and you are literally sitting elbow to elbow with other customers. With the dining area aside, let's get onto the food. Whenever The House has the scallops as an appetizer special, Get it! It is an amazing starter with three big scallops, micro greens and with a lemon butter sauce. Other highlights is definitely the pork chop with the pomegranate sauce and the mushroom rice. The pork chop is one of the most amazing pork dishes I ever had. The pork chop is juicy and tender with plenty of sauce as well. It's a pretty dish with two towers of crispy taro and a potato salad with carrots. I have also tried the miso sea bass, wasabi noodles and even the coconut creme bruleee with passion fruit puree. Pretty much everything I have tried here exceeded my expectations. The amount of flavors from each dish gives your taste buds a little dance and makes you want more. The staff is very nice and they are very quick with clearing your table as well. The tables are quite small and when you order a lot of food, it takes up the entire table. There's nothing else I can say that hasn't been said already. Great food and you will definitely want to come back. Check out the pictures I uploaded as well. Expect to pay between $75-$90 for a party of two for dinner for one appetizer, 2 entrees and a dessert.

My boyfriend and I ended up at The House while being in Chinatown and doing a search for "nearby" dumpling places on the Yelp app. We saw that The House had fabulous ratings and went in. At first when we got there, we were a little disappointed, because there was only one type of dumpling on the menu, and it wasn't something that either of us wanted. But we decided to stay and I am SO glad that we did. The House was the best restaurant we ate in during our trip to CA. We got the deep-fried salmon roll with spicy mustard appetizer, which was so delicious and spicy! For the main course he got a pork sandwich and I got the wasabi noodles with grilled pork. Both of us were "oohing" and "aahing" over our food the entire time. Everything was so fresh and so delicious that we just sat there in epicurean awe. The beers listed on their menu went well with the food. They also had an extensive wine and sake/soju list, but it was a little pricy, so we just stuck with beer. The food was definitely better than anything we were expecting to have in Chinatown, and we will gladly go back during our next trip to San Fran!

Make reservations and must try: Black Cod and Garlic Noodles The Black Cod is not on their regular menu, but it must be a frequent special since so many people have tried it. It was melt-in-your-mouth soft and tender. The sauce that went with it was perfect and didn't take away the flavor of the fish. They give you a generous piece of fish, and also two pieces of crab sushi on top. The sushi was alright, nothing too spectacular, but the cod was probably one of the best fish entrees I've ever had. The garlic noodles are separate, and they come as a side in the seabass entree. However, the seabass wasn't as good as the black cod so I wouldn't recommend it unless that's the only way you can try the garlic noodles. The garlic noodles are your basic Chinese chow mien, but better. Not oily and not too salty. They are perfectly flavored with garlic and soy sauce, but for some reason I couldn't get enough of it. We also tried the soft shell crab appetizer, which was alright. The noodles that went with it were way too salty, but the crab was very tender and juicy. It also came with a sauce that was completely unnecessary because the crab was already seasoned. I think in general, most of the dishes at The House are pretty heavily seasoned and on the saltier side, but I do believe Americans are used to the heavy flavors, so it makes sense. For dessert, we got the apple pie a la mode. It came with a small scoop of vanilla that was half melted because the apple pie was really warm. The apple pie was completely unstructured because of the nice crumble top. I really think this was the best slice of apple pie I've ever had. I'm always afraid apple pie is too tart or too sweet. However, this apple pie had the perfect combination of both flavors. My favorite part was the crumble top. I don't normally like to get the same things over again, but I'm pretty sure my next visit I'd get the apple pie again. Overall, I can see why this place is so popular because the food is very fresh and made very well but just slightly overly seasoned. Service was excellent. It definitely helps that the restaurant is tiny, but I really felt like our waitress was always within reach. Water was always refilled, and food came really quick as well. There are lots of good restaurants in the area, but the black cod is a must try here!

Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night with my sister and two friends. I was able to make a reservation earlier that day for 7:30PM the same night (although everyone says it's so hard to get a reservation, was quite easy!). We tried the soft shell crab as an appetizer which was good. It was served with noodles and the crab was yummy. I ordered the ribeye medium rare -- it was quite delicious (big enough to share). My friend ordered the sea bass which she loved. Overall, everything was yummy. A bit on the expensive side, but very good. Service however was just okay. Would come again!

I've wanted to experience The House for a very long time but ex'ed it out because parking in this area is such a hassle. ÊThe guy was taking me to a "surprise place", which just happened to be that focacccia bakery in North Beach (Liguria Bakery?) that I had been to many many times, so it wasn't like a new place for me. ÊWe couldn't find parking but , no big deal because this was a perfect time to TRY to find parking and go to The House. ÊWe found parking, very close to the place. Well, it really was fantastic. ÊWe walked right in without a reservation. ÊIt was around 1:00 on a weekday. We started with the famous deep fried crispy salmon roll. ÊThe portion is generous and 2 can share. It is served with a delicious cabbage slaw and a wasabi dipping sauce. The sauce was a perfect accompaniment to the roll. The guy had clams in spicy broth. ÊThis was a fantastically yum dish. ÊThe broth was so good that he asked the wait person to leave the bowl on the table so he could anoint his udon soap (the next dish ) with the broth, ÊShe wasn't even grossed out! The grilled Chilean sea bass was the best piece of fish ÊI've had in a long time. ÊThe ginger ,soy and garlic were in perfect proportions and the fish was grilled to perfection. ÊI would order this again. We would go back to The House. ÊIt is now on the rotation list.....

Grilled Sea Bass lives up to the hype! I'm an avid rice guy - but definitely get the Garlic Ginger Soy Noodles with this one instead.. Black Cod Special topped with California Rolls was just as delicious.. both had melt-in-your-mouth goodness! Fresh + cooked and tasted just right.. Deep-fried Salmon Roll was so-so.. probably wouldn't get it again.. I was hesitant to go with the Mango Tapioca for dessert.. I grew up with heavenly tasting ripe mangoes from the Philippines and can't help but compare every time.. but this one actually reminded me of the staple dessert they'd serve after your meal at Chinese restaurants back there.. still not as good.. but a solid effort! If you want dessert - go with this one.. otherwise, not a huge loss if you skip it (unlike the two fish dish must-haves!).. Expect cramped spaces and a loud atmosphere (guys couple tables down had the most obnoxious ear-piercing voices ever.. if my fork wasn't too busy with the yummy food I probably would've hurled it at his face Brad-Pitt-with-spear-Troy style!) Definitely make reservations.. Otherwise, no biggie.. leave your number, walk around, and they'll call when your table's ready..

Kind of wish I hadn't read the 2,000+ reviews before trying this place because it was difficult to be objective. However, the sea bass was indeed delicious! One point: Make sure your ENTIRE party is on time for the reservation. There is no waiting area, so you have to stand in this scrunched corner of the room and try not to get hit by the door while staring awkwardly at everyone eating. Since there is no waiting area, there is no hostess waiting for you. I'd been standing there awhile when I saw what appeared to be an exhausted hostess. I decided to be polite and wait for her to approach me, when an anxious family walked in and tracked her down. After giving said family the death stare, I approached the hostess and told her that I was 'here' for my reservation. She asked if the other half of my party was 'here'. I fibbed a little and said that she'd be there any minute. She told me to let her know when the other half of my party arrived. Gahhhhhhh! Hostess(?) : 1; Erin : 0. She proceeded to seat a couple who came in after me. I'm admittedly new to this trendy restaurant eating thing, but that gets a thumbs down in my book no matter how good your food is.

I came here on a date! Although I was initially turned off (It was so damn crowded. Ridiculous, I could barely move through the crowd) it turned out to be amazing. We got three things--grilled sea bass, which was served with a side of Asian-style noodles (kind of like Jjajangmyun with a slightly bitter edge) and beans; black miso cod (not too sure if this is exactly what it was called), which was served with bokchoy, two plantain chips, and california roll; tempura soft shell crab. Firstly, the sea bass...HOLY CRAP. It was perfectly cooked, ridiculously moist and juicy, with each piece coming off tenderly onto my fork. Amazing. The beans were well-cooked and the noodles were good too, but it seemed like a loose interpretation of jjajangmyun to me, so it wasn't as interesting. The sauce it came with was good, but it had a slightly bitter bite to it. The black miso cod was SO FLAVORFUL! Also amazingly well-cooked. They are the gods of fish-cooking, apparently, because they were just on a roll...and speaking of rolls, the california roll! It was okay, kind of dry, but still A-okay. Plantain chips were plain, but I don't like plantains.... Soft shell crab was good, but in my opinion not THAT memorable. Service was good, thankfully. Our server was sweet and very lovely! :) All in all, I loved this place. Food was just...wow. I definitely recommend coming here if you want to impress a date! And...you know, there's that sex shop next door... just kidding.

Not the best first impressions. The place was packed and we had arrived on time for our 7:30pm reservation yet we still had to wait another fifteen minutes to get a table. The interior is tight with dim lighting, a bit like a sardine can. The staff has to squeeze through the madness to provide their hospitality. But as soon as we got a table our waitress somehow managed to list off the many specials of the day from memory. The specials and menu sounded unique and tasty. For appetizers we ordered the beef tartare, mussels, and tempura fried soft shell crab. The soft shell crab was predictably delicious although it's adorned with these very long bread sticks that come out of its body like petrified dreadlocks. The beef tartare could have been anything although it was still tasty. While the mussels were good the broth was absurdly rewarding. Good thing nobody at my table was interested in it because I slurped it all down with my trusty mussel shell. I had ordered the pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce served over mashed potatoes and vegetables. Whenever there are pork chops on a menu I get them. The House certainly delivered. It was so friggin' good. The currant sauce isn't too sweet but it's robust and savory enough to elevate the juicy pork chop. I had a hell of a time cleaning the bone. I tried a couple of bites from my party's dishes and they all tasted good. I remember the wasabi noodles being tasty. All the meat was properly cooked. For dessert we were thinking of saving ourselves for a spot later in the evening so we only ordered the tapioca pudding. It was delectable. The consistency is a bit runny yet this makes it refreshing and not too heavy. In hindsight I wish we had just had dessert here. ____ If you can get past the London Underground interior with bombastic noise level, you'll be eating some tasty tasty food. Not recommended for large parties.

My husband and I ventured to The House after reading all the amazing reviews. Ê It was a Saturday night at about 8:30pm and we had a 45 minute wait. ÊDuring the wait we hung out at the salon next door which has live music. What we ordered: Deep fried salmon roll - my husband liked the roll and I thought it was ok however we both agreed that the wasabi dipping sauce was excellent. Wasabi noodles with flat iron steak - both my husband and I thought this dish was delicious! Sea bass with garlic noodles - Êthe Sea bass was delicious! ÊI liked the combo of Sea bass with the garlic noodles but the noodles eaten on their own did not stand out to me. Apple pie crumble - we both thought this was a good dessert to end the night with. The couple next to us ordered the calamari and it comes with dried fish flakes on top that move due to the steam of the dish and this gives the illusion that the calamari is still alive. ÊIt is pretty cool and freaky if you are not expecting it! Note - both are entrees came with garlic noodles. ÊThey were burning hot, no joke, so be careful or you will not be able to taste the rest of your meal:-) Food: 4 stars Service: 4 stars Noise: Loud Drink menu: wine, sake and beer Wait: average Parking: street only, it's the city:-). Tips and Tricks: ÊMake reservations or expect to have a wait! The House is a small and very loud restaraunt. I think the experience would be more positive if you keep your group to a maximum of four people. We will definitely return to The House!

Two things that I am always and forever hesitant to try in a restaurant and usually never experience at perfection: cooked fish, and Asian fusion. Two things that The House excels in. To perfection and beyond: cooked fish. And Asian fusion. What?! I was impressed by everything, and this almost never happens to the Yelper in me. Not only were all the fish dishes we ordered cooked wonderfully just right, but the combinations of Asian inspired flavors with New American style plates were served up in surprisingly decent portions at surprisingly very affordable prices, given that The House is a special occasion type of restaurant and all (but of course it's still perfectly appropriate to show up in shorts and flipflops. Except if you're wearing shorts and flipflops in SF, you're probably a really lucky tourist who accidentally wandered in here . . . anyway, I digress) Combinations like wasabi with noodles, perfectly cooked flat-iron steak, miso with flaky butterfish, curry with rich seabass, delicious berry compotes with tender pork all come out beautifully and creatively executed. Start off with some deep fried salmon rolls. Order something different for everyone and then pass the plates around. True, you won't want to even dive into your food because it's so beautiful, let alone have your entire table pick at it, but you'll also thank me later for being able to try more combinations of some of the most flavorful, delicious dishes ever in this unassuming little (but not hidden - as evidenced by the thousands of other rave reviews already) gem in North Beach.

I have been here more than five times in the last half a year. Need I say more? Hands down, THE best Asian fusion in the city. This place only sits about 50 people, so reservations are not easy to get, your best bet is to reserve a couple of weeks in advance or have a early/late dinner (they open at 5pm). The last time I was here, we ordered the seared scallops as an appetizer along with sea bass and garlic steak. The scallops were cooked a little too well but the sea bass, in my opinion, makes up for everything. It was extremely tender and flavorful. Our waitress was extremely attentive and brought us everything we ask for. Definitely a SF gem if you ask me.

All I can say is, "WOW". This place, is no doubt one of the most creative and unique places I've eaten in SF for a great Asian American fusion restaurant. First tip: MAKE RESERVATIONS! This place is a small little hole on the wall (I think next to a sex shop) with not too many tables and fills up FAST! I came here for a nice date with my BF and believe me, it's definitely a GREAT place to go for a small two person birthday date or anniversary! We ended up getting the grilled garlic sea bass and a wasabi cod dish that I believe was one of the specials for the night. Our food came out RIDICULOUSLY fast for the quality and the presentation was PHENOMENAL! So professional and beautiful. The fish was cooked to perfection and the small sides that came with it complemented the dishes well, The garlic sea bass came with garlic noodles, a side sauce of garlic, and green beans. All a great Asian American fusion combination. I definitely preferred the sea bass over the cod dish, but the cod dish was good too. The cod dish came served over some broccoli and very uniquely rolled California rolls. The wasabi sauce wasn't my favorite but not bad. For a classic dish, definitely order the grilled garlic sea bass! You can't go wrong! But no doubt, if you're ever craving some quality seafood with an Asian twist, this is your go-to place!

2 days after eating here, I'm trying to hard to think of a reason why this is a 4 and not 5 star restaurant, I mean, the service was solid, the atmosphere is solid (albeit cramped), the food was perfectly cooked, beautifully plated, and tasty (scallops, prawns, sea bass, chocolate cake, apple crisp - no losers here). At the end, it's because no item was original or orgasmically flavorful enough for me to get the shakes wanting to go back 2 days later. I know that's kind of stupid, but its the difference between liking and loving. But there's certainly a lot to like.

All the work of finding parking and making a reservation are well worth a visit to The House. The food lives up to all expectations. The deep fried salmon roll was perfectly cooked and not overly greasy. The poki had a pleasant hint of wasabi and tasted really fresh. Unfortunately they were out of the pork chops during our 7pm dinner. The sea bass and the flat iron steak were cooked to PERFECTION. Both dishes were amazing and some of the best ever. The portions were very reasonable. The one downside was that the noodles fell short of even being "good" for me. The wasabi noodles had no hint of wasabi whatsoever. The garlic noodles we got with the sea bass tasted more like the korean black bean sauce noodles than garlic noodles. Finally, try to avoid the table in front in front of the window. The table is tilted to one corner and it is just an awkward seating spot to begin with.

This is my favorite spot in North Beach. It's an Asian fusion place but where as most places are Asian food being Americanized, this place is American food being Asianized. The best thing is the grilled seabass with garlic noodles (it's basically asian noodles) and green beans. I've never had anything quite like it. Sometimes they have American kobe beef which is done quite well here. For appetizers, the tuna tartare is fantastic and the soft shell crab when it is available. Service is impecable. The spot is quite small though so try to make a reservation or else expect to wait a hour or so.

Who needs another review with 2000+ right? But after I read the first few, I disagreed and thought I'd put my 2 cents in. Tuna tartare: good but very wasabi intense. Salmon roll: delicious & cooked well (super soft in middle) wrapped in seaweed and deep fried, ... but pricey. Maybe not worth it. Pork chop: WINNER!!! My dish and SO GOOD. Huge portion and with sweet pom sauce.. Dine mate agreed was also the most aesthetically pleasing of all the dishes. Ribeye: Good. standard. Sea Bass: overrated. Don't understand the hype. Noodles were salty, green beans limp and lifeless. Halibut with orzo (special): okay as well. Creamy orzo. No cod special tonight. Wait is long-ish (45 minutes @ 730p on wed night, no ressies) but food comes out SUPER fast. Waitress are fast and efficient, if not sugary friendly.

ÊThere was a bit of a kerfuffle with our reservation (they couldn't find it for a while), but once they found it, they were apologetic that they couldn't seat us right away. ÊWe ended up being seated at 8:50 - not bad, but when there is no place to wait, that seems long. ÊThat, however is the only reason I am giving The House 4 stars instead of 5. ÊThe food was extraordinary and the service was attentive without being intrusive. ÊWe especially loved the scallop appetizer that was a special that night - perfectly seared scallops with an amazing sauce. ÊWe thought about ordering it again as a dessert at the end of our meal! ÊThey also have an interesting and affordable wine list. ÊWe don't live in the Bay Area, but we will come back to The House the next time we are in San Francisco.

"Asian Fusion" conjures up mixed feelings depending on who you talk to. ÊFor those having extensive experience with serious traditional Asian fare, one can't help but cringe a bit in apprehension on the inside. The House, however, will dash that thought right out of your head with just one (epic) meal. Even before my friends and I had a chance to peruse the menu, we were intrigued by the presentation and intoxicating aroma of the ginormous entrees being served to neighboring tables. ÊAs a result, we were torn about only ordering a couple shared small plates and a main dish for everyone with so many great options in front of us. ÊThe solution? ÊGet nearly every small plate and go for broke on the main =D We hit nearly every point on the spectrum with the top offerings being the much raved about Deep Fried Salmon Roll as well as the American Wagyu Beef Tartare & Uni sashimi special. ÊThe salmon's great texture transitioned from fully-cooked flaky meat on the outer edges towards a raw core, all wrapped up in delightfully thin and crispy batter. ÊThe horseradish in the accompanying mustard matched superbly and made each bite a pleasure. ÊOn the cooler side, the sashimi was beautifully presented and included components such as paper-thin apple slices and bits of toast that complemented the creamy tartare and uni both in texture and flavor range. Our Steamed Mussels and Coconut Curry Clams special were also huge hits and outshone all the iterations I've had in Boston. ÊThe mussels had a lovely brininess and the curry makes you want to sop every last bit up with grilled bread. ÊWhile we're doing a little comparison to Beantown, the Maine Crab Cake here came out on top as well with light, creamy texture and not a hint of excess grease. The others including Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab, White Shrimp and Chinese Chive Dumplings and Grilled Octopus. ÊThe freshness of the ingredients made their presence known right away, but they didn't stand out nearly as much in general. ÊGo for them if you have the appetite, otherwise they can be skipped for the mains. ...Which leads me to the Warm Wasabi House Noodles. ÊEvery one of us agreed that the angus flatiron steak was tender to the next level. ÊRidonkulously tender? ÊYeah, that sounds about right. ÊThe noodles underneath brought back memories of Dan Dan noodles with awesomely spicy flavor. ÊSuffice it to say, I could've inhaled the entire thing in minutes and left with a glorious food coma. If you're still reading this, thanks for bearing with me ;) ÊWe couldn't finish without nabbing a dessert...or three in the form of Coconut Creme Brulee, Dark Chocolate Cake and the Blueberry Tart special. ÊNot a single one lasted much longer than 60 seconds as evidenced by the clashing of spoons left and right. ÊIf you had to pick one though, get on that creme brulee - flawless execution rounded out by lovely passionfruit puree on top. Lastly, the logistics. ÊThe House is indeed on the smaller side with cozy seating arrangements and surprisingly moderate noise levels...always a big plus in my book! ÊService was very helpful with ordering and consistently timely throughout the meal. ÊAnd the damage? ÊA mere $50/person with tax & tip included for what was essentially a DELICIOUS and filling 12-course meal. ÊAim for about a week in advance to place reservations and come ready for excellent food that really lives up to every last bit of the hype.

This meal was probably the highlight of my SF trip, as far as my stomach is concerned. We stood in the doorway waiting for 30 minutes for a 10pm table (who the hell is eating dinner at 10pm?! Oh yeah, US.), but I didn't mind a bit. To my left were a bunch of hippie 20-somethings smoking some reefer outside, to my right was the scent of Asian fusion goodness. Strange combo, but it kept me both hungry and uh, relaxed. The hostess, a Lucy Liu doppelganger, kept us updated on the status of our table, and seated us as soon as she could. As soon as I sat down, downed some plum wine, and got my food, I was in culinary heaven. Sure, the restaurant is about the size of some Real Housewife of Orange County's walk-in shoe closet, but the food is well worth eating ass cheek-to-ass cheek with a stranger and overhearing someone's fascinating conversation about burritos. In fact, you might learn something.

Highly disappointed. As someone who comes to SF to eat (with my excuse being work), I am always looking for something new and exceptional. Asian fusion especially is something I expect the best of in SF. A co-worker in the area recommended The House, and raved about it being the best new thing, on par with anything in the city. I'd have to say otherwise. Atmosphere was good, as was the service, and the waitstaff was really friendly. The placemats were really neat, simple but with a cool little design that my graphic designer fiance would really dig. The layout was cozy and fun. Decent list of well priced wines. I started with the fried salmon rolls, and enjoyed them greatly. Perfectly cooked, still rare on the inside, and the sauce was a delight. Presentation was beautiful, with delightful flavors and texture. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. I tried the fried soft shell crab app special next, after seeing it at the table next to me. The presentation was awesome, but the taste was just blah. I've had better in many tin roof seafood shacks in many a city; this one just tasted like deep fryer. That being said, the sauce it was served with was interesting, and made it so I finished the crab. The noodles as well were fairly tasty. Last I had the pan roasted skate and muscles special. Again, very blah. I adore skate, and when done right, I would compare it to the taste and texture of crab w/o the work. This one had none of that deliciousness, but instead was more like a fried catfish fillet one would find at an East Texas all you can eat buffet. In fact, I had to confirm that I had received the correct dish, b/c this one had a fried appearance/texture/taste. The muscles were nothing special, and the sauce quite bland. 6 hours later and I have indigestion from the meal, which I am still tasting but not in a good way. For this, I paid $72 with 2 modest glasses of wine ($8 each). At $9, the salmon rolls were a good value, and the (only) star of the meal. $12 for a single soft shell crab was about 25% percent too high. $28 for the skate with 3 little muscles was a rip. Based on Yelp scores, I guess I'm the exception, but I just don't know what else to say. Maybe I expected too much, or got the bad dishes on a bad night, but even A-OK is beyond this meal to me.

Lately we're witnessing so many different cuisine styles it can make your head spin. Some are great and yet some are just ok. "The House" is an excellent choice for a first date. The chef's special with coconut butter fish was absolutely divine. They have some of the most creative dishes you'll ever see. This place is in our top 10 must try list. ;-)

You need to start with the classic Fried Salmon Rolls. ÊAfter splitting that (which is a perfect size for two to split) my girlfriend got the Special which was a Black Cod with Crab Roll, and I got the Seared Tuna with spicy mustard. ÊBoth entrees were incredibly good...but the Black Cod was out of this world. ÊA melt in your mouth fish with a delicious teriyaki glaze (highly recommend going whenever they offer this dish). ÊPrices were high, but definitely fair for what you get. Overall we had a great time with awesome food. ÊOne downside was it did seem like they were eager to move us on to the next dish when we kind of wanted to take our time and enjoy it slowly. ÊStill a must go-to!

On a Birthday trip with my best friend, we wanted a really good Asian Fusion restaurant. ÊEveryone kept recommending us to this popular one in Chinatown. ÊWe decided to look elsewhere and stumbled on the House. ÊIn first going in there, it looks like your average one off Asian place where you can get good, but not great food. ÊHowever, after eating the appetizers (my friend- fried salmon) *me- cant remember, but is was FANTASTIC) ÊWe knew we were in for a treat. Ê Since it's so small, make sure you make a reservation b/c it gets filled quickly.

This place is outstanding! The only reason I'm giving a 4 is because I just reviewed Gary Danko and gave it a 5 and they are not exactly the same experience. I think for the type of food you're going for here and restaurants at the same level this place deserves 5 stars. Reservations are highly recommended. My husband and I went here for a birthday dinner. I had called ahead and they had a little candle placed in the dessert for him at the end of the dinner. Very reasonably priced for excellent food and service. Our waitress was fantastic! The ahi tuna app was good. The kobe beef app was a special and was out of this world. Like other reviews the sea bass was perfection. I got it with the garlic noodles and LOVED it. The ribeye was excellent, nice cut of beef and very flavorful. Dessert: what I also love about this place is that they had phenomenal dessert options! We got the key lime pie...delish! I can't wait to go back!!

The wife has been trying to take me here since she went with her girlfriends, and i was hesitant when the term fusion was used to describe it but glad i went. Food was good, and i really liked the mussels, and the soft shell crab apps. Very cool little spot near little italy and good place for date night. Not so great for parties but they seem to accomodate them. No rsvp on a saturday night, but only had to wait for like 20 minutes and they took our number to text us when it was ready so we could grab a beer at the thai place next door.

Great food, fun atmosphere, make a reservation... Seriously, they are really good and tiny, we had a reservation and we still had to wait like 5-10 minutes, there was a couple without one that said they had been waiting 1.5 hours when we got there and still didn't get seated until about 15 minutes after we did. I think everything we ordered was from the specials and not the menu. We got: Curry clams appetizer - great flavor, wish there was more bread to sop up all the delicious curry sauce. Scallop appetizer - perfectly cooked, good sauce, I think there was some caviar on top too? Miso Cod - What can I say, it was fantastic. Black Truffle Kobe skirt stake - Just enough truffle flavor to enhance things but not in your face or oily, also an awesome dish. For dessert we got a tapioca thing (I no longer remember what they called it specifically) which was really good, and the coconut passion fruit creme bržlŽe. Flavored creme bržlŽes tend to always be something of a let down for me. I like standard creme bržlŽe but it is pretty much always the same, even when it is supposedly some flavor. This one was different though because the passion fruit was a sweet sauce they put on top so you actually got a ton of that flavor mixed in, definitely enjoyed it!

MY MY MY ! YUMMY!!!!! My bestie and my good friend took me here for my birthday and boy was it delicious! I believe my cousin took me here once a long time ago and I was still a kid so didn't really know what I was eating but man have I been missing out all these years. The three of us ordered the mussels for appetizer, pork tenderloin, sea bass, and seared ahi tuna. ALL THREE DISHES WERE so delicious! I would say the tuna was best, pork tenderloin and sea bass last. But don't get me wrong it was still delicious it was just those two are a better choice. The tuna came in a perfect seared, I'm usually a huge fan of raw fish only, but this time it was seared so wonderfully I didn't mind it at all. The sauce that it came in was super amazing. I wish they would just sell that. The tuna came with rice and spinach which was also very delicious. The tenderloin was super juicy. That sauce again, soooo delicious! The sea bass, was burnt a little according to the bestie, but I thought it was fine. The soy sauce thing was yummy as well. Their sauces make all their dishes super delightful. After that we all shared a coconut creme brulee. It was a little too creamy but still good. no coconut taste tho, but I didn't mind that very much, I actually didn't want it to begin with. Haha The only bad thing was they were serving and taking away things a little too quickly, as if they were trying to rush us out of there or something, even though there were spaces available. I don't know if that's just how they want to be efficient, but I don't like the feeling of being rushed. For instance, I didn't even finish my mussel and they took away all the plates, so I felt like I had to shove it down my throat. But other than that the food was amazing. will definitely come back, I want to try the wasabi noodles!

Food: 5/5 - The presentation of the food, and the combination of flavors here is what I would expect of a top-end restaurant in San Francisco. Service: 5/5 - Despite being a busy/small spot, the servers are always friendly and accomodating - the fact that they prefer phone reservations only goes to show that they emphasize on human interaction despite the convenience of OpenTable/online reservations. Ambiance: 3/5 - The space is very small, so expect that you will be in tight quarters. The ambiance is not particularly nice, but the food and value makes up for it. Value: 5/5 - Prices are very reasonable considering the quality and presentation of the food, with entree options in the low to mid $20s.

I ordered the Chicken Breast with roasted portabella white truffle oil sauce ($18), and it was delicious! The service was great, I have no complaints. They even called us to come back because they thought one of us left our credit card. Definitely look forward to trying out their other dishes in the future. Some things I did not like about the restaurant were the dim lighting and how cramped it was. Even though I would like to come again, I am ghastly afraid of the parking situation because it was TERRIBLE when I went. I grew up in San Francisco and am well-aware that the North Beach area can be quite busy, but did not think finding parking would be as impossible as it was for us. We went here on a Saturday for a friend's birthday, but her boyfriend had to drop us off and go home since we couldn't find parking even after searching for over 30 minutes. Maybe we just were unlucky and that particular day was wrong, who knows. This is just a warning, don't let it stop you from getting good food.

I missed House on my last trip to SF, so I made it my mission to eat here as soon as I got here. ÊAs recommended by other yelpers, I made the reservation, Monday May 7 at 8:00 p.m. Ê Seating: No one at the door to greet us. ÊI assumed this was normal here. ÊA server came by and asked to wait while table became available. ÊI waited a year to experience the House so had no problem waiting little longer. ÊServer gave our table to another patron who came after us, made us wait 20 minutes, and then presented two tables which was available the whole time we were waiting. ÊNo apologies, just sat us, like this is the normal presentation at the House. Food: I came here for food after all so I decided to let it go and try to enjoy the food aspect of it. Had hamachi (?) appetizer, it was blend. ÊI had skirt steak and my husband had the sea bass. ÊHonestly, it was not that great. ÊI really wanted to like it but the steak was tough and the noodle had no flavor. ÊI tried the sea bass, cooked perfectly, but again no flavor. Ê Service: Our server, same woman who gave our table away, had absolutely no personality nor sense of service. ÊTo make matters even worse, she dropped used oily fork on my husband's shirt. ÊI almost never care about services when I eat out but this woman just made me want to leave this place as fast as possible. I soooo wanted to like this place......

This is a long overdue post that has been sitting on my "to do" reviews half written. ÊJust a warning, it's going to sound odd since I wrote the first half almost a year ago and the bottom half just now. ÊNevertheless, here you go: Things that turn me off during the early stages of dating: 1. ÊWhen a guy overuses the saying "lol" or "LOL" when texting. ÊSomething about that makes me cringe. ÊIt reminds me of a 12 year old girl. ÊIt just makes you less masculine for me and just completely turns me off. Ê 2. ÊWhen a guy uses the restroom more than once when dining together in a restaurant, especially if there isn't any alcohol involved. Is there something wrong with you? ÊDo you have a bladder problem? ÊDo you need to make a quick phone call to your boys for advice? 3. ÊWhen a guy gets his order before me and rather than waiting for my order to come, he consumes his plate. ÊBy the time my plate arrives, he's pretty much a halfway done with his food and now I'm left to eat alone while he stares at me. ÊDid a pack of wolves raise you? For the record, this was my first and last date with that person. ÊI've been wanting to try this place for such a long time so I was super excited that my date picked this place. Ê Here's the deal, I would probably like it more if my friends did not hype this place up. ÊI wanted to love this place, I really did. ÊBut the truth is, it was way too oily for my liking. ÊThis is coming from a person that adores fried chicken and chicharron. ÊGranted, it is Asian fusion but my plate was so greasy that the oil was almost soupy. I ordered the Seabass with garlic ginger soy noodles and the oil was overwhelming. ÊMy date, however, told me that they were "off" that day and that it normally is a lot better. ÊI was able to try his, Kurobuta Pork Chop W/ Pomegranate Currant Sauce. Ê(even though he was almost done with it before I started eating) I definitely was in love with it and I was jealous of his order. Ê The sauce blended very well with the tender meat. ÊThe presentation was beautiful on both dishes, I can give them that. ÊThe dessert was amazing, we ordered the mango tapioca dessert. ÊIt was just the right amount of sweet. As for now, they get 3 stars only because like I was told that the chef was off that day and that the place is normally much better. ÊI'll be back soon and I'm hoping to give them a much better review.

Terrific. Didn't think "asian fusion" could live up to the hype of previous yelpers and friends, but it actually exceeded expectations! Had dinner with another couple with their 15 month boy. Although not the most children friendly venue, I think it is more than adequate to accommodate a little vermin or two. Apps: Grilled Calamari, Oysters (both terrific) Entrees: Grilled Sea Bass, Miso Cod (special). Fish cooked perfectly. Go for the cod if you had to choose one Dessert: Truffle chocolate cake - don't think you can go wrong here Great value for an amazing dinner for two as well. The above with tip is about $80-100 (without drinks).

This is my second time eating here, and the first time was excellent as well. I'll try to break it down for you. The first time, I got the sea bass with noodles and green beans. The side dishes were nothing special; it wasn't bad, but nothing memorable. The sea bass on the other hand, was one of the best pieces of fish i have ever had at a restaurant. I eat out a lot, and love seafood. But for some strange reason, this small, somewhat awkward, and not-without-its-flaws restaurant does fish very very well. It was moist, with a textured exterior, and well seasoned. The soy-sauce based dipping sauce should be used in moderation; it can quickly overpower the fish. The second time I went, we got the following: Appetizers: Crispy salmon roll, kobe beef tartare (Special that night) The crispy salmon roll was pretty darn good... with a somewhat rare middle and just cooked through exterior. The hot mustard based dipping sauce compliments it well as long as you do not use too much at once (it has a bite) The kobe beef tartare was ok in my opinion. It would've been better if the (mayo?) based sauce the kobe beef was mixed into kinda overpowered the delicate taste. Entrees: We got the flank steak on wasabi noodles, Pork Chop w/ pomegranate sauce, sea bass w/ green beans and noodles. - Sea bass: See above description.. it was still perfect. - Pork Chop: The meat was cooked to medium, thus pretty tender. It was seasoned well on its own. The mash underneath was good enough as a side dish. I actually liked the asparagus spears: cooked enough to be tender, but still with a Êbite. The pomegranate sauce actually was too much.. it was good, but the sweetness tires your palate after a while. - Flank Steak with Wasabi noodles: The noodles are whatever. It's too heavily sauced, and the wasabi is just perceptible. The flank steak is cooked well however, and pretty well seasoned. Out of the three, this was the weakest. This is a must-try, at least once to see for yourself. It gets packed since the place is fairly small although it's deceiving in its size due to couple tables towards the back. Get a reservation, but if you don't make your time in 15 minutes, they'll give the table away.

The food was worth 5 stars, the quality that makes you close your eyes with each bite to better experience it. Scallops, mango beef salad, asparagus with sesame sauce, hamachi sashimi with avocado and a mix of baby capers, finely shredded cucumber and some other magic stuff on top. Amazing. Our waitress (tall, pleasant, young Asian) was fantastic. The missing star is for a reservation snafu, Êor more precisely, how it was handled. ÊWhen I arrived I said my name and the small Asian woman went off, came back and then said, sorry no reservation for Robert. I never mentioned a Robert. I told her my name again: Pxxxxx Rxxxxx. She came back and said yes, she had found Rxxxxx. She showed me to the table. After we had ordered and received our appetizers she came to our table, clearly very stressed and stood over us asking in a somewhat accusatory tone whether there had been a mistake because the real Rxxxxx had arrived. ÊI told her that I had called the day earlier, that someone had returned my call and confirmed me that very morning. She was doubtful in a knitted-eyebrow, intense unwavering gaze manner and then blurted that it didn't make sense because they usually fill up a week in advance. I'm not even sure what she was thinking. That we had snuck in under a false name and fooled them? I told her my cell number and asked her to check the phone record so she could see that they had called me. She didn't take me up on it, but spent the next 15 minutes fussing nearby and being generally odd. That and the fact that it is a very small crowded restaurant and somewhat loud made it a little distracting. The food however was so amazing and quick that we ended up laughing the whole situation away with our waitress (tall, pleasant, young) who was embarrassed by the whole thing, particularly because as she pointed out, there were several open 2-tops around us. As we left the other woman glared at us again. It's hard to imagine what was going on for her. I'd go again, because everyone else was great and the food is incredible, but I'd wear my sphere of magical white light to protect me and ask to be seated far, far from the small, high-strung, shrewish woman. Yes, of course I'm kidding about the magical sphere.

This place was awesome. My beau and I are often skeptical of places dubbed as "fusion," particularly "Asian fusion," so we went in with no expectations. We made a reservation a week in advance for a large party, and because of the small restaurant, we were asked that we finish in 1.5 hours because of the demand (which would later be confirmed, because near the end of our time it was already 10pm and another party was waiting to eat). The restaurant was PACKED. There's only a small bathroom in the back (and there's a very narrow pass to the kitchen, so be a wall--a very tall wall). TIP: A friend called in to special request their miso black cod...which would later be like a total clouds-parting moment. Our waitress was very nice, We ordered several appetizers, such as their mussels and salad, which were all very tasty. It's good to buy several with a group and just pass it around the table. As for the entrees, my special ordered cod was EXCEPTIONAL. Instead of it coming with its sushi (which is made interestingly flat and long), I opted for their udon noodles. They brought this out on a separate plate, which made my meal of excellent value. The noodles are very good, remniscient of zha jiang mian (Chinese/Koreans, you knows it!). The cod is EXCEPTIONAL. It's melt in your mouth, soft, fatty...everything you would want in a fish. The sirloin and wasabi noodles were really good, which have a nice kick to it without giving you a nasal flare. Someone in the group also got the fish with squid ink risotto, which I was really jealous of. There was one staffer who seemed to be the manager, who wasn't a chipper girl when she came to our table or just in general around the restaurant. But, we had a good waitress, so this was easily pardoned. Great food, do your research on fan favorites, and enjoy!

I've been going to House for years (even back when they had their spot on 9th and Irving) and it remains one of my favorite spots in the City. The food is well presented, always tastes good, and priced reasonably. I'm never disappointed. Here are some of my favorites: Tempura lake beans - I always order this to start; a mound of crispy friend beans with a tasty ginger soy dipping sauce. Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak - I like this dish just for the noodles more so than the sliced steak. Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy - Buttery, moist fish that melts in my mouth (it comes with rice, but the waitstaff usually lets me substitute their garlic noodles in its place). Kurobuta pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce - One of the best pork chop dishes I've had; meat was very tender and juicy, but the sauce was a delicious surprise. Angus ribeye steak, housemade teriyaki sauce, toasted garlic butter - Super flavorful with the teri sauce; meat is tender but can sometimes be a bit on the fatty side (but I like that). The place is rather small so I'd recommend always making reservations. Parking can be tricky because of its location in the heart of North Beach, but I always find a spot in the parking lot on Vallejo and Stockton.

This restaurant is so cute! It's like a small little house right in the middle of Little Italy. Not suitable for a big party, 2-6 people is OK. Cute date night place :) Get the sea bass - its delicious! Melts in your mouth. Absolutely love the sauce that goes with it. Their garlic noodles are also good, small portion, but tasty. Parking is going to be nuts. If I were you, I wouldn't even try looking for street parking. There are two parking lots on Vallejo street, between Stockton and Powell - just 2 blocks away. Have fun!

My co-worker and I popped in for lunch. ÊI'm so glad he picked this place! ÊWe shared an appetizer that I believe was halibut sashimi with nori and other amazing fixins. Ê For my main course, I chose the Udon Noodle Soup with grilled chicken and toasted nori--awesome! ÊSo $10 is a lot for soup; but it was a huuuge bowl and I thought it was worth it so I guess you can say you get what you pay for--quality and quantity. Ê The seating is a bit crammed or you can look at it as 'intimate'. ÊWe chatted with the couple next to us which was nice... we oogled a dessert they ordered and ended up getting the same thing. ÊI believe its was a chocolate truffle cake with coffee ice cream. ÊI'm not a huge fan of coffee ice cream by itself, but it was delectable with the cake which was a silky chocolaty delight. Since we came in for lunch, we just walked up; but if you were planning on driving, good luck with the street parking. ÊI like the white, rectangular, paper placemats with the "house" shape punched out centered on the bottom.. such an inexpensive yet smart way of alluding to the name.

What a great find. ÊMy wife and I wanted to celbrate our 11th year anniversary in the city and try something new and we found this place. ÊMake reservations because this is a popular restaurant. ÊThe place is small but the food is AWESOME! ÊWe followed previous YELP advice to which food to try and it did not let us down. ÊIf you are looking for good food that makes you wish you had two stomachs to eat more then this is the place.

It's always good to be observant when trying out fusion cuisine. My friends visiting from the East Coast had really positive things to say about this place, so after a day of exploring in the city, we made our way over. I heard beforehand our friends had placed a reservation for a party 8 (us) since this place gets crowded really quickly. To my surprise, we only waited for 20 minutes before being seated. A first impression of the decor: small, cozy, and definitely intimate. Great for large parties or for a date night. It's got a rustic yet modern twist on the inside. On to the food: Our group ordered two appetizers: the salmon roll and squid salad. Both were amazing, although my favorite hands down was the salmon roll because it was essentially deep-fried sushi-like rolls with really tender salmon, served with this amazing wasabi. On a side note, our friend's aunt was friends with the owner, so we got a free appetizer on the house. Can't beat service like that :) For the main dish, all my friends ordered the steak served over wasabi house noodles, but I went a little adventurous and ordered the pork chop served with pomegranate sauce. DEFINITELY had some sort of food-gasm when I ate it. I think this place is also known for their sea bass dish, but I would skip that to get the pork chop. Portion sizes are definitely okay for the price they charge you. Desserts: They have a kick ass chocolate lava cake and an assortment of house-brewed teas to help you digest. Pretty standard. All in all, for everything I ate (3 appetizers, 1 entree, dessert and tea) I only dropped 35 bucks. Pretty worth it for a once-in-a-while foodie excursion :) Tip? Get the pork chop dish and make sure to make reservations well in advance. You won't be disappointed. It's a good place for Asian fusion.

One of my favorite restaurants here in San Francisco, especially in my favorite part of San Francisco, too - the North Beach. ÊI think it's one the best Asian fusion restaurants here in the city. ÊI have been here many times in the past 4 years, but haven't been able to write a review. ÊI love their grilled sea bass dinner which is excellent. ÊAlso their calamari, scallops appetizers were great. ÊTheir grilled pork chop dish I had and that was good, too. ÊI came here for lunch not too long ago and I had their udon noodles with chicken which was very good and the broth was very tasty, too. Their food is delicious and their desserts are a treat, too - I love their key lime pie. ÊGreat service and the food is delicious each time I come here.

Get your monocle out if you're ordering the Caesar salad. You will need it to find the micro scallops. With that minor bummer aside, I enjoyed just about everything about The House and their Asian-fusion fare. Sure there is limited seating, but it feels cozy. Not old and broken-in cozy...more like comfortably close. Everything the group ordered looked delicious and everyone left satisfied overall. Just keep in mind that if you're remotely hungry, you'll need to order something else supplemental if you're eyeing up the Caesar Salad.

Absolutely lives up to the hype and so worth the wait. I'm not a huge fan of Asian fusion and I'm always skeptical of places where so many people rave about it but this one DEFINITELY is well deserved. Uni with avocado and beef tartar --their special appetizer of the day. SO amazing. Both the uni with avocado and the beef tartar came on a lightly crisp wafer that left it feeling light yet flavorful. My gosh, I'm craving this as I type this. Sea bass with garlic noodles - The dish everyone raves about (so of course we had to order it). Fish is cooked to be light and juicy. The flavor is absolutely amazing. The garlic noodles were such a nice complement to the fish Wasabi garlic noodles with steak - Steak cooked perfect with just the right amount of tenderness Man, such a win on all levels. Also, such a small restaurant so definitely make a reservation or be prepared to wait.

Winner winner Asian fusion dinner! Mad props to Alex S for using his mad Yelp skills (makes sense - he's a CM) to find this little gem. It's not cheap, but it's not that expensive either, especially since I'm used to DC prices, and the food was both unique and excellent. The restaurant itself is small and unpretentious, with only a handful of tables, clean lines and minimalist decor. The feel was upscale enough for a work lunch, with professional service and trendy aesthetic touches like adorable all-white placemats with one little house shape hole-punched out of it (no Chinese zodiac calendar here). Our calamari and shrimp dumplings were good enough to order a second round, and ALL of our different entrees looked, smelled, and then tasted so enticing, the one would-be healthy-choicer who'd ordered a salad threw in the towel and ordered another entree. My entree, the udon noodle soup with chicken, was excellent. Flavorful broth, tender strips of lightly grilled chicken, and a delightful surprise - my favorite element, floating cherry tomatoes that popped when bitten, releasing hot, zesty tomato juice in your mouth. Memorably tasty and fun. This little spot is worth cabbing to even if you're not in the neighborhood - the menu's locked and loaded with winners and unexpected treats!

Ok... so we made reservations on Sunday but couldn't make it... we called and the reservations person was just absolutely wonderful. ÊWe rescheduled for Monday. It's a given that parking in SF is pretty challenging but with a little luck you can park within 2 blocks of this wonderful little restauant... we were lucky. On our arrival, there was a line out the door. ÊHowever, our lovely waitress asked about our reservations and we were immediately seated. ÊWithin minutes our waitress came took our order. ÊWe sat, talked, and within 20 minutes our entrees came. We wanted to try their Ribeye Steak & Bass... OMG! ÊIts so good! One thing tho... I ordered a Tsing Tao Beer. ÊIt was so busy our waitress forgot my beer. ÊOther than that, I will definitely recommend The House to my friends & family. Enjoy!

Came here on a Friday night with my bf with a reservation for 6:30. The place was packed and we weren't seated until 6:45, but I enjoyed the food greatly! - Seared giant scallops for appetizers were delicious, but you can never really go wrong with this dish - Sea bass was perfectly cooked, so it was fatty and smooth. My favorite dish! - Skirt steak with garlic noodles and shoe string fries were also amazing! The steak was flavored well and the noodles were also really good but a little oily. This was actually too much food for me and my bf, so we took our leftovers to go and ate it as a late night snack. I was surprised how good it still tasted! I can't wait to go back here to try more of their dishes!

I celebrated my friend Sarabeth's birthday and I finally got to check out one of the restaurants on my list, The House. The House is a small restaurant nestled in North Beach. In a district full of cheesy and over-the-top Italian restaurants, it's a little funny to find a Asian fusion restaurant tucked in the corner of Grant Avenue and Broadway Street. But, it was absolutely delicious and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I started the meal with the hamachi sashimi special of the day and the deep-fried chicken liver with greens. The hamachi was so fresh and literally melted in my mouth. The deep-fried chicken liver is a pass. I thought the breading was a little too thick and masked the taste of the chicken liver. I also got to try the crab cake and I loved it. The breading wasn't too thick and the crab filling was plentiful and fresh-tasting. The House cooks fish perfectly. My favorite dish was the miso cod; second favorite was the salmon; and third favorite was the sea bass. I don't think I've ever had fish cooked so well in my life. The miso cod was one of the specials of the night and served with two uncut sushi rolls on top. The cod was almost buttery and the sauce complemented it perfectly. If you see the miso cod on the menu, order it! The salmon was a nice-sized fillet and very moist, served on top of bok choy. My sea bass was soft and came with a ginger soy sauce. While the sea bass was also very good, the cod and salmon were even better. My friends raved about the pomegranate pork chop and it had a nice honey glaze on it. While tasty, the flavor reminded me of a piece of BBQ pork (char siu) that you can buy at Cantonese restaurants. I feel like I could eat a piece of char siu and be just as satisfied. The fish is better and I would definitely choose any of their fish dishes over the pork chop. For dessert we ordered the chocolate cake, apple crumb pie and mango tapioca. All of the desserts were solid. I liked that the chocolate cake wasn't too heavy, but it still had a rich chocolate taste. I love that the apple crumb pie had big pieces of baked apples and the crumb topping was yum. The mango tapioca reminded me of a classic Asian dessert and I think it's my favorite out of the three. Honestly, we were all a little full (because the portions at The House are so generous) and couldn't even finish all of our desserts. If you do go to The House, be sure to make reservations. The restaurant is really small and I saw tables being turned away at 8 p.m. on a Monday night! Don't let that deter you because I guarantee you'll love it!

This is my FAVORITE restaurant. I've been coming to The House since I was 10. (Yes, I was a spoiled baby!) I still remember their location on Irving St, which was just blocks away from my house. Anyway, here are the must haves: Appetizers: Deep fried salmon Rolls - The Spicy Mustard sauce has a nice kick! Deep Fried String Beans - Nicely battered with tasty dipping sauce Main Dish: Chicken Curry Noodles - MY ABSOLUTE favorite! Ê Seabass - Another childhood favorite! This will literally melt in your mouth! Flat Iron Steak - So tender and juicy Wasabi Noodles with Salmon - The wasabi taste is light but it's soooo good! Dessert: Mango Tapioca Chocolate Cake Bread pudding I basically love everything they have! Warning: Parking is hard to find so come early and make a reservation because it's always crowded!

ÊIf I want a knockout meal when I have guests in town I take them here. ÊConsistently great, not just good. Ê I've come for lunch and dinner many times, quality is always there.

Went here yesteday for the hubbys 37th birthday on a Thurs night. ÊIt wasnt crowded at all, as we were seated right away. The place is much smaller than expected, and the decor was simple and light. ÊDefinately a nice place to take a first date or so... but nothing fancy. ÊThe lighting could be a little brighter, it was dimly lit, or maybe our seat just missed the drop lighting they had inbetween tables, but... being that the food was AMAZING, i would have liked to see it a little more. On to the good stuff... We ordered for appetizers: Seared scalops Hamachi sushi topped with some mango salsa and avocado Soft shell crab with vermacelli noddles with a kick of Sarracha. I honestly dont think Ive had such an amazing infusion of foods in my palette. ÊI absolutely wanted more, and was looking forward to our entrees. Ê Entrees: Garlic Ribeye with Garlic noodles Miso Seabass with Garlic noodles Not your typical garlic noodles, they were more of the thick egg garlic noodles you find in the chow mein, but tasty nonetheless. Êthe garlic was not overpowering, and it was flavorfull, and as a matter of fact, I almost wanted some rice just to sweep along the residual sauces from the meal. The meat was tender (honestly, how can you ruin rib-eye), with all the juicy fat drippings, with thin slices of carmelized garlic on top, below a bed of chinese green leafy vegi (dont know the name of them, but do recognize them when I go to Ranch99). Ê The seabass was grilled to perfection. ÊI know with seabass being such a light white fish, if it isnt made right, it can taste funny. ÊIt was savory, AND tasty. Ê I honestly didnt have one bad remark about the food. ÊIf this review is solely for food, it would be 5 stars. Held back a star because it was indeed my husbands birthday. ÊAsked them to do a little something for acknowledgement, and the waiter said they would. ÊAt the end, they forgot ... and came by when we already paid the bill with a lit candle. ÊReally? Ê$160 tab and you couldnt even remember to put a candle on cookie, whip cream, anything?! ÊOh well... sign of the times. ÊOH, of course because of the dim lit restaurant, it wasnt as appealing as the food could have been. Overalll a GOOD experience (could be GREAT), but.... we would come back.

I was put in charge of finding a lunch spot for a team of about 12 people in a city I didn't know and wanted to choose something different, fun and delicious. Using Yelp, I found The House. And it was great. To make a reservation here, you have to call - there's no online system in place. However, calling is easy to do (and if they are closed, leave a message. They will call you back to confirm.) And they had no problem taking our large reservation. We got there early and they were still cleaning up our table. I was a bit worried, since it's a tiny one-room place, that it would feel cramped, but not at all. On the dot of our reservation we were able to sit and it was fine, all of us around a long rectangular table. The atmosphere of this place is pretty "meh". Beyond cute placemats with one tiny house stamped into it on the bottom, there's white walls with some artwork hung up, and that's about it. However, the staff is so friendly and the food so good, it doesn't really matter at all. Let's talk the food, shall we. Our table shared a ton of things and they were each amazing in their own way: fried calamari that came our in perfect rings, shrimp dumplings that were flavored fantastically, alll so good. For my entree, I got the tuna BLT with wasabi mayo and it was amazing. Warm, flavorful, each bite awesome. The prices are indeed high. Know this going in. You are going to pay for what you get. However, what you get is so delicious it is worth it indeed. I would come back here in a heartbeat - especially when needing to entertain a large group in an intimate setting again.

Let me make it clear before I start to get hate messages from lovers of The House-- the issue with my review is not the food whatsoever. I thought the taste, portions, value, presentation, etc was great. We had the salmon roll, the tartar, and the asparagus for the appetizer. We also had the wasabi noodles and the sea bass for our entrees. All that we ordered was good and did not disappoint. If I were to give a review just on the food alone, it would get 4 stars. The service, however, was VERY disappointing. I have never written a yelp review (that I can recall) in regards to service. I am not a stickler for service. Give me my food, be nice, refill my water, and everything is kosher in my mind. But the service I experienced yesterday was probably the worst I have ever encountered. I have never been so rushed during a meal. We got to the restaurant and were so pressured to order something quick, I felt like I was going to get yelled at if I didn't order something soon. The point of a restaurant is for a dining experience. If I wanted to get Chinese take-out, I would expect the rude, short service. But somehow, they apparently didn't know where they were, because I felt like I was at Panda Express! When we were done with our meal, our plates were shuffled away, and before I could blink, the dessert menu was in front of my face. Oh, and did I mention, they already took away all our place mats, and crumple them in front of us? Before I could even read the first words of the dessert menu, they asked what we wanted. We ordered something random, and it was good, but I never got to enjoy it, because again, the plates were taken away as soon as I took my last bite. The bill was immediately "plopped" on the table, followed up with an obviously fake, "whenever you're ready." Well, my mom wanted to finish her pot of tea, and the five of us were all talking, ya know, basic dinner conversation. There were two dirty spoons left over from our dessert at the far end of the table. The waitress made a point to reach over (no regard that she's interrupting) and snatch the spoons and take them to the kitchen as if she was disgusted that we were there for (heaven forbid) an hour. Oh and while she took the spoons, she made a point to open the check the bill, and ask if it was ready. I thought you said "whenever you're ready?" Well, we had 5 people in our party. With appetizers, entrees, dessert, and an after dinner tea, we were in and out in an hour max. They're lucky we're fast eaters. Food is good, but if you want to have the experience similar to the Panda Express, then here's your place.

The House is good... I just don't think it is super amazing great. We got the soft shell crab, tuna tartar, and the miso cod special. Everything was cooked really well and the food was delicious. Service was ok, they seemed a bit off but it was fine. Prices are what you expect for this type of food but I found it a bit pricey Ê (we ended up paying around 25-30 per person in the end--keep in mind we got 2 apps and a main). All in all, a good place to go for a nice meal but be prepared to wait (restaurant quite small--they don't take reservation for small groups) and to pay a bit more.

I would have given it 41/2 if i could, but i can't so 5 stars it is. This place has great food and that's what i love, great food. Kobe beef with black truffle reduction- Superb! Steak was cooked perfectly and the flavor of the steak was great and the truffle reduction matched the steak with just the right flavor, the mashed potato was a bit dry and lacked thoughtfulness. Wasabi Noodle with Flatiron steak- Awesome! Steak was cooked well and the wasabit noodle is one of the best items at the place, not too spicy and the flavoris very special. The appetizers were also very good. I would say try everything if you had enough people, each item has its unique strengths, depending on your likings. The only half star is the location and size. I called in to make a reservation because you can't make reservations online and they asked me for a credit card to make a reservation, which was also a first for me. Secondly I've been here a couple of times and there are always bums and weird people walking around, obviously because its located near a filthy area. Lastly they included gratuities in the bill for a group of 6 people. I thought it was for 8 or more people unless the specify, which i don't think they did or wrote it anywhere. haha i know i might be nit picking at small things, but its just FYI. I still gave this place a 5 stars tho, =)

Wonderfully great experience, it's worth every minute. Ê Tucked away, in a slightly non-descript is a special little place. ÊIt's Asian food, sure; and one can proclaim to the high heavens; with the might of Joey Laurence "WHOA" once you take your first bite. ÊThe food service and quality was that mind shatteringly-smack_your_cousin-kick_him_in_the-?shin-good. Ê I dare say, with a place that has over 2000 reviews on Yelp, there has to be something that works. ÊI took my Seattle taste buds here, and armed with a more than attractive girl to help keep me honest, decided to find "The House." ÊThe dŽcor is simple and homely; the tables and chairs close, everyone her is cozy, without being cramp. ÊThe first detail you might notice after being seated is the little house cutout in the table placement. ÊIf you know the finer details like that are taken care of, you have to expect the food will have a focus on detail. Ê Looking at the menu, it's simple, one page of goodness. ÊThey seem to understand that a good kitchen with a focus, should stick with that focus, with only maybe 15 small places, and 10 main items. ÊWe did the following; two small, and two main plates. Steamed Mussels Tempura Shrimp on Greens Sea Bass with Vegetables Seared Ahi Tuna. Here we go... Steamed Mussels were cooked wonderfully, full of flavor, extremely soft and tender. The sauce was light and just enhanced the texture of these sea found delights. ÊThe Tempura Shrimp was a visual sight, a mountain of greens, with shrimp and avocado. ÊWhat makes or breaks a dish like this was the cooking of the shrimp. ÊIt was a delicious lightly fried masterpiece. ÊThe shrimp were tender, and juicy. Ê The greens balanced it out perfectly. Sea Bass, is an animal that is fatty, full of love fish. Êit makes the world feel better; and in this case, it does make the world feel better. ÊIt's blacken, just slightly on the top and bottom, a crust that balances the juicy flesh in the middle. ÊIt was soft, fall apart goodness-that-would-make-you-scream-in-joy-with-?new-found-salvation. Yes the clouds parted for this meal. ÊMine on this night was Seared Ahi Tuna. ÊA towering piece with three richly cut pieces of tuna, on the slopes of a rice and vegetable hillside; with rivers of what I recall, a spicy aioli. ÊThe fish superb, the flavor textures were perfect, and if you didn't know it, eyes closed, you might imagine yourself in pure Zen. Ê So "The House" proves to be good-amazing-loving-warm-from_the_heart food, but what is that feeling you have when you are done? ÊPure Satisfaction.

This little North Beach gem has never failed to impress me. The creative, bright Asian flavors and generous portions keep us coming back for more. The salmon rolls are a must and they occasionally serve a special porcini mushroom soup that I absolutely crave. This also gets an extra star for not being a pretentious place to dine.

Usually not a huge fan of asian fusion restaurants but The House may have change my mind. We went to The House as it was heavily endorsed by some co-workers particularly the miso black cod which they described to be mind-blowing and indeed it was. Between the 5 of us we essentially turned our dining experience family style, so we got to try a bit of everything. We split several small dishes and ordered up an entree each. Everything we had that evening was excellent, particularly the black cod. The black cod was served up with a delicious sauce and a roll cut into two pieces. The fish was brilliantly marinated/prepared, and it was so tender and buttery, I'd kill for a bite right now. The restaurant is pretty small and the air conditioning system didn't work particularly well that evening so it got a little irritating eating sweaty. Their sake selection could be kicked up a notch, but other than that, it was a great experience! Tip: Make a reservation. Second tip: Do not miss the chance to eat here ever. Third tip: Look at our food pics and other reviews here: http://www.facebook.com/É

Came with my mom and boyfriend at the recommendation of my sister. I've always been wary of fusion food. But this does a great job at bringing asian flavors into dishes without being overly forced or gimmicky. FOOD: Started with chicken livers/baby greens and mussels. Entrees had pork chop with pomegranate/currant sauce, sea bass, and lamb chop special. The mussels I could pass on next time. The chicken liver with salad was great. All the entrees were delicious - the winner being the pork chop (and I don't even like sweet sauces with meat usually). And the boyfriend liked the sea bass even though he's usually not into fish. ENVIRONMENT: Tiny! Gotta make those reservations. And because of the coziness, it gets a little bit loud. But nicely decorated with photographs. SERVICE: Friendly and prompt. They also had a lot of specials, so props to the waitress for remembering all of it.

Came here a few months ago and it was amazing!!! My boyfriend and I ordered their deep fried salmon roll, the flatiron steak with wasabi noodles, and their sea bass with garlic noodles. The salmon roll was divine, it just melts in your mouth. Its the perfect portion and balance; its not heavy nor oily. The flatiron steak with wasabi noodles was good as well and I loved the wasabi noodled; very different. My my boyfriend also really enjoyed his sea bass, but he liked the wasabi noodles more. The restaurant itself is really small and cramped, so there's not much privacy between patrons. It is also recommended to make reservations since they can only accommodate so little people at a time. Service was pretty good; can't complain.

I was blown away by just how good their food was. I came here with a group of girls for a bachelorette and the place is small. And, since I don't love fish/Japanes food usually, I was a little weary. However, I needn't fear because this place was awesome. We had steamed calamari, scallops, sea bass, mushroom rice with prawns, and fried green beans - and oh-my-gawd was everything amazing. I seriously didn't know I could like fish so much! I am still dreaming of the scallops, which were perfectly cooked. I would definitely come back here again - it's probably good I live 6 hours away, otherwise I'd be here all the time!

I really, really enjoyed lunch at The House yesterday with my newly-formed CM team, Mid-O-Lantic (not sure if that's the agreed-upon spelling or not). Alex S was in charge of making the lunch arrangements for a team consisting mostly of ladies, and the guy certainly knows how to please. A variety of fish entrees, noodle dishes and even salads were available for our ravenous appetites. But first, we started with tender rings of fried calamari and some steamed dumplings. For my main: wasabi noodles with grilled pork. This dish of comfort had just the right amount of heat and lots of fresh veggie straws to add a kick of flavor. The pork was excellent even though it was a little too fatty for my tastes. My colleague had a lovely plate of sea bass with snap peas. I had a couple of her peas and they were great. Best of all, most plates were well under fifteen bucks. I'm considering a return visit sometime this weekend!

The bf took me here for my birthday. What a treat! Looks like the Yelp community has spoken for me already, but may I repeat, get the sea bass. You will not regret it. I skipped the garlic noodles and opted for steamed rice on the side. The snap peas were a nice pairing with the bass. So delicious! While the ambience is nothing to write home about and the space is really crammed, you kind of forget that when you immerse yourself in their delicious food. Skip the salmon rolls. Try the truffle cake, mmm. I'd like to go back and try some of their other small plates, they all sounded intriguing. They have an eclectic alcohol list too! Treat yourself! Note: parking sucks really badly around here, so allot yourself 15-20 min before your reservation. But, there is a decently priced structure nearby on Vallejo, http://www.yelp.com/biz/É. Good luck!

When I read all the reviews, I had pretty high expectations for The House, but I didn't think it was going to be blow-my-mind-amazing, well I was wrong. Hands down best food I've eaten in SF (so far at least)! Service, food, and presentation were all impeccable. The only thing area for improvement would probably be to get a larger space. The tables are pretty close together so it gets a bit cramped. Make sure to make reservations! I came on a Wednesday night, so reservations were easy to make, but if you're coming on a Fri/Sat, be ready to wait for a bit. We ordered: - seared scallops - ahi tuna tartar - pork chop - black cod - chocolate pecan pie - creme brulee Total = $96. I don't like scallops or cod, but the way the House made it changed my mind. I wish i tried the seabass, after hearing all these raving reviews about it, but I guess that will have to wait till next time. The pork chop was literally falling off the bone and pretty much melted in my mouth, which is rare because pork is a bit hard to cook to get it that tender. Both desserts were good, but I enjoyed the creme brulee the most. It came with some pomegranate sauce? and the top layer was baked to a perfect crisp. Overall, I was very impressed by every aspect of this restaurant. House, be expecting me back again soon!

Asian fusion food is a difficult style to get right, and at The House they definitely succeed at the genre by turning out hearty, feel-good dishes turned up with a kick. After spying the Asian Wasabi noodles with steak in the photos I knew that that was the dish for me. And I was not disappointed. The udon noodles had a fab tooth feel and were spicy without overwhelming the rest of the flavors on the plate; the steak was perfectly cook and tender as could be. My only regret about the meal was that while the space and service were fine, there was nothing particularly spectacular or special about either. If only someone would bring this style of cooking to Paris where I'm based!

Overall: Slightly disappointed, but leaving as 4 stars because the food IS good. Does it live up to the hype, though? No. I really wanted to love The House (I spent a good amount of time online beforehand researching what dishes to order and salivating over the beautiful yelp pictures of the food), however I left slightly disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the food IS good - I just don't think it merits the 2,000 person 4.5 star average. It's the same kind of disappointment I felt after Aziza (except there, the entrees didn't actually taste good). We tried: - The hamachi sashimi appetizer - 3.5 stars (the fish quality was good but the salsa-like topping was more bland than I'd hoped) - The deep fried salmon roll appetizer - 3.5 stars (good, but I likely wouldn't order them again (IMHO the wasabi way overpowered the otherwise tasty salmon).) - The sea bass with garlic noodles - 4 stars (the main reason we came) (the fish was cooked well, the ginger / soy sauce actually made the fish slightly sweeter (which I wasn't expecting).. and I might order it again.. but.. somehow.. I expected more!) May go back again sometime, but will likely cross a few more off my to-try list first :)

The atmosphere and service was meh but the kitchen is on. point. I heeded Yelpers' advice and ordered the sea bass entree and it was perfect. ÊThe filet is soft and thick with a salty, buttery charred crust. Ê When I had the first bite my head tilted back, my eyes closed, and I almost fell out of my chair. For appetizers we had the deep fried salmon rolls and the oysters. ÊBoth were also stupid delicious.

Returned for a second visit near 6 months after the first. What took me so long anyway? Brought my wife's friend who was visiting from Korea so that she could enjoy the delectable goodies that they serve up at The House. In order to multiply our enjoyment, we had the ingenious idea of sharing all our dishes. Thus we proceeded in devouring each dish one by one. To start we had the tuna tartare with nori chips and a half dozen raw oysters. I enjoy trying different types of tartare at the many restaurants that I visit. I must say that The House has one of the best. It's the perfect blend of tangy, spicy, and fresh tuna taste along with the unpretentious chips that melt away easily into the background. The oysters were good, I enjoyed the spicy sauce that accompanied the oysters. It seemed to be their own blend that precluded the need of tobasco or cocktail sauce. Although I think I prefer tobasco. We had the sea bass and pork chops again and they were excellent, AGAIN! I just love biting into that sea bass. The sudden charcoal grill taste combined with the seared outer skin and soft inner sea bass is to die for. I don't understand how they cook the fish like this and not dry it out. Tricky tricky asian fusion cooks... :) ÊThe pork chops were soft and inviting and paired well with the pomegranate sauce. I still like the sea bass better and my wifey liked the pork of course. I swear she just likes to choose the opposite of whatever I choose... Since we had a third person with us we had the opportunity to order a third and NEW dish this time. (The real reason for coming to The House with a third person comes through.) We had the chicken with white truffle oil. The name of this dish does it no justice, neither does the real name on the menu. The chicken is cooked to perfection, nice and juicy on the inside and definitely not dry. The sauces surrounding the chicken were the kicker. This is truly what fusion is about. There was some combination of curry and other sauces that were just absolutely KILLER. None of us could stop eating the chicken, we all wanted the last piece. Another great dinner at The House. How can I not give this place 5 stars when I always walk away pleased? The prices are also pretty reasonable for a nice restaurant. We had 3 appetizers, 3 main dishes, and 1 dessert for $120 not including tip. I'd say that's a pretty reasonable price for what we had.

Unique, delicious, Asian Fusion cuisine! No frills decor in a casual small space, but a very refreshing change of pace from other 4+ star restaurants in the city. The food was phenomenal, and could be offered at a much higher price if it was served in a more upscale setting...but I like it just the way it is. Efficient service, and delicious food at fair prices. TIPS: If you're walking in, expect a wait. You can't go wrong with the Salmon Egg Rolls to start, and the Pork Chop or Sea Bass for your main dish! And don't forget to taste everybody's dishes at your table...you won't want to miss out on any of these delicious flavors!

The House that the food Gods built (if food Gods exist). My friend and I snagged the earliest table they could reserve on a Sunday evening - the 5 p.m. slot. Oh me oh my, this place was a hit, as it was packed even at this hour. As we looked around our fellow foodie neighbors, we began raving about the immaculate presentation of their appetizers - the fried soft shell crab, the deep fried salmon rolls, and the oysters - just to name a few. We opted for the fried salmon rolls - a solid start. Our only regret was failing to order "tapas style," as we were salivating, just eyeing the appetizers around The House. My friend opted for the sea bass, and I, the pork tenderloin. These portions were certainly hearty - but we couldn't put our forks and knives down. The sea bass was accompanied by garlic noodles (with the other options being rice or potatoes), and the noodles had the perfect blend of sweet & salty. This is a must-get for your side selection, unless you simply naturally gravitate to rice and potatoes. (If that's the case, though, you're better off at an American joint!) One word for the pork. Juicy. I wouldn't have been surprised if this pig was on steroids - in a good way, of course. I haven't had kahlua pork, lechon, or bacon this good. And the fried yam placed perfectly on the mashed potatoes were a perfect addition to this foodie masterpiece. The desserts looked enticing, and unique for an Asian fusion place. But the portions were just too much to handle - any more food and we would have brought (and weighed) The House down.

Well, well... wouldn't you know it? Another incredible meal, featuring seafood, in San Fran. Who'dah thunk it? When we walked into this tiny, Asian fusion restaurant for our team lunch, I was a little skeptical, but boy was I wrong. It's not an easy task to get this style of cuisine just right, but The House seems to be a crowd pleaser. The sea bass was in-cred-i-ble... seriously. Light, moist, flavorful and just all around perfection. It's served with delicious, fresh green beans and sticky rice with a soy sauce reduction of epic proportions. And you know who recommended it? Fellow yelpers, that's who! Listen to your yelpers, people! I also tried the shrimp and chive dumplings and, well, even though we were sharing them I ended up hoarding three of them for myself. The prices are a little high, but you certainly get what you pay for. Besides, there's really something for everyone on the menu. Our group of nine ordered everything from udon noodle soups, tuna BLTs to fried chicken sandwiches. Yep, everything. I was lucky enough to sneak a bite (or two) of the wasabi udon noodles with pork from my colleague. Oh yea, it was tasty. If you're looking for something a little different for lunch, you love seafood and Asian tastes, The House is definitely a spot to try.

Yum. The salmon roll was different and tastes good. The grilled sea bass was good, I normally get sick of that fish because its too fatty tasting but that wasnt the case here. The wasabi noodle has a mild kick and the steak was good. The soft shell crab had a pretty presentation. The fish sauce had a slow but good kick.

Yum! This is the 2nd time in a couple years visiting The House. The 1st time was a vague memory although I remember it was tasty. The 2nd time did not disappoint! We ordered the squid salad, fried tuna roll, steak w/ udon, and lamb. The squid salad was the only fail...barely any squid but the salad was good. The fried sushi was very tasty..kinda like a sushi tempura. The steak w/ udon was decent but the lamb...YUMMY! Great flavor with the sauce (which I usually do not like on any of my meats) and cooked well although slightly chewy in parts. Definitely impressed. Prices are reasonable for the fusion ambience and style. Place is definitely cramped but they sat us right away with our RSVP. Definitely return trips are in order and highly recommended!

This place was overrated for me. I was very excited to try it, but after the dishes, I was a bit disappointed. I started off with the White Shrimp Tempura Appetizer. This I liked. It came with a mountain of tender greens and a light tangy sauce with avocado and thin apple slices on the bottom. It was quite delicate and nice. Expectations up. I ordered the grilled salmon on a bed of bok choy in a bonito sake broth, topped with a thin slice of daikon and a side of rice. The salmon was a bit overcooked- it wasn't dry, but it was very firm and heading there. The daikon was just hard and chewy, but at least the broth was good. My friend had the sea bass and it was overcooked. It was dry, but the sauce was a nice complement to the sea bass. My other friend had the roasted chicken, which she liked until she got to the wing/drumstick portion and found pink pieces and stopped eating it. All in all, we left silently and didn't ask how we liked the meal and instead, trekked to find ice cream, hoping it would save us.

OMG....the food here is Outstanding! ÊI went here with my girlfriend on a whim and with no reservations. ÊThey originally told us about a 45 minute wait so they took my number and we went to a bar next door. ÊBefore I could even finish 1 beer they call me and tell me they have a table ready! ÊAwesome! ÊWe started off with the ahi tuna tare tare and the charred octopus salad with fried pork skin. ÊThe tuna was good and had a nice spice to it, but the real hitter was the charred octopus salad! ÊThat thing was amazing! ÊIt's basically a lot of finely sliced veggies thrown together with octopus and chicharron in a light vinaigrette - everything complemented everything else so well - the tanginess, the textures, the slight hint of spice - soooo good. ÊIt's probably the only other salad (next to my mom's chinese chicken salad) that I would completely fill my belly on and be totally satisfied. Ê So, naturally with a good start like that, I was extremely excited for main course. ÊI ordered the flank steak over wasabi noodles. ÊSounded a little odd at first and like it wouldn't go together, but boy was I surprised. Ê I had ordered it medium rare, and it came out that way! ÊI hate the places that ask you how you want it, just to get a dry, overcooked, tasteless waste of meat. ÊAnyway, the two just went together beautifully - the meat was tender and the noodles were tasty, slightly spicy and complemented the meat well. ÊI'd say this is probably the only dish I've ever had that incorporated noodles and steak on the same plate and it blew me away. Ê My girlfriend ordered the pork chop - not as good as what I had, but still awesome. ÊThe chop was cooked medium (chef's recommendation) and I don't think I've ever tried a juicier pork chop. ÊThere wasn't a single millimeter of meat that wasn't tender and juicy. Ê The House has certainly jumped to the top of my list as one of the best restaurants in the Bay Area and possibly the world!

Do not let the look of this place fool you - the food and service here are amazing! This little restaurant is just off Grant Street and except for all the people inside it doesn't look like much. Even their website is not very descriptive and the place is not very large but the food is out of this world. Have to try the Crab Cake and must order the SEA BASS as it's the best I've ever had in the city. The menu is full of delicious looking Asian fusion delights and we'll defiantly be coming back here to enjoy more. Local hints: This place is in north beach so know that parking is a pain in that part of town. Absolutely make a reservation and there are a number of fun little bars just down the street so if it's a nice night plan to taking a walk after dinner and enjoying a cocktail.

If you can deal with the claustrophobic space, which often has the frustrated waitstaff dipping and dodging to avoid colliding with seated customers, you are in for an incredible treat. This is the best seafood/asian fusion restaurant in the city. The cuisine is simply sublime. We started with the fried salmon rolls, which are far from what you would expect - not ground salmon, but big, bold strips glistening inside a wonton wrapper. Then the seared scallops swimming in a rich lemon sauce, topped with fresh watercress, presented beautifully with a dollop of caviar on a cucmber in the center. It was an array of colors worthy of Van Gogh, almost too beautiful to eat. Followed by the ahi tuna tartare served in what tasted like a wasabi glaze, presented on wontons for ease of operation, and the octopus salad, which is a blend of textures, from crunch pork rinds to crisp vegetables to chewy cephalopod. And finally, the soft shelled crab which is presented like something out of science fiction, but extremely tasty and fresh. Main entrees were the steak, sea bass, and the mushroom rice with bonito flakes. The mushroom rice was easily the standout dish - delicate, flaky, fishy bonito on rice with the texture of risotto. The steak was extremely tender, and the sea bass was moist, flavorful and delicious. Each of these one dishes could have been "the best dish" at any other restaurant. All the deserts, equally good. The upside down cake and chocolate cake in particular.

My friends and I wanted a nice, final meal after our weekend in San Fran. We are all visiting and The House was recommended by vayable. So we booked reservations at 8PM on a Sunday...it was still packed when we arrived. The place IS really small. It looks like it seats 40-50 people max. We ordered calamari, caesar salad with crispy scallops and crispy octopus. My caesar salad was basically a caesar salad..the scallops were small bay scallops and there were maybe 4 on the plate. Deep fried and were soggy, not crispy at all..Everything else we ordered was really good. The calamari was crispy and not chewy. I probably would be chose the mussels if I were to go back. We also ordered the sea bass, the pork chop and the seared ahi-tuna. All winners. Presentation was great. We all came dressed in jeans and I was a bit nervous but nobody said anything and everyone else was dressed pretty casually too. Service was great, we got free refills on our lychee black tea and they were ninjas about it because we never even noticed! Originally we wanted to go to Gary Danko, but thinking back on it now, The House was perfect as the price was where we wanted to pay without being too hard on our wallets. We are 20somethings here. The waitress was really attentive and it was a perfect mood to chat about our trip and our favorite things..The House included!

I finally made it to The House and actually got parking right in front on a Saturday night. You definitely need a reservation, as it's a tight space with no real waiting area. Ê You start with house made pickles that get the appetite going. ÊWe went for the calamari appetizer, which literally came out in like 2 minutes. ÊIt was a little tough to enjoy as people waiting by the door kept bumping into our chair, and there was a huge chilly draft every time the door opened. ÊThe calamari itself is nice and crisped and not overdone, with a pretty standard cocktail sauce, garnished with shredded kimchee. They had a lot of specials on the menu that night, but as everyone had recommended the sea bass, I had to get it. It was tender but had a nice sear on one side, and it was flaky but not too rich. ÊIt had a good amount of flavor for something not drowned in sauce, although a small drizzle of the reduced soy glaze helps it out a lot. ÊI got it with rice, which ended up being plain white rice, so I think noodles would have been a better option. ÊThe stir fried green beans were thin and flavorful but very oily. Then we were debating between the pork chop and the steak, and the wasabi noodles for the flat iron steak helped it get chosen. ÊThe steak was pretty tender, but it lacked the flavor I expected. ÊThe beef was fresh, but maybe it just needed some more salt and pepper? ÊOn the other hand, the noodles underneath are well seasoned, with a little kick from the wasabi, which was not overpowering. Ê Portion sizes are pretty good and left us a little too full for dessert. Ê Am I the only one not giving them 5 stars?? ÊIt wasn't bad, but I think it was just too hyped up. ÊPrices are very reasonable for what you get, but I tend to be pretty critical with fusion style restaurants. Ê It's a cute little family owned place with lots of regulars. ÊService is very friendly and prompt (water is refilled quickly), and they keep coming by to check if you're done. ÊI understand the need for quick turnover in a small space, Êbut you almost feel guilty for eating slowly. ÊHowever, if you like fusion, it's worth checking out.

Came in here last week and was impressed. Put this on the shortlist of spots to hit up while in San Francisco if you're into community food, creative grub and solid atmopshere. I won't bore you with me being impressed by the kamachi, oysters & the mussels while thinking the crabcakes were ho-hum, but I will say this: "The House has done for sea bass what nobu has done for black cod." Ridiculously good.

Had reservations here on Friday at 6:30 and got seated with minutes. I can honestly say this was probably one of the best meals I've ever had! The crab cake was absolutely divine, it was kind of spicy with wasabi mixed in but totally fresh. The Sea Bass was definitely the best Sea Bass I have ever tasted. I think they must have poached it and then grilled it, it was just delicious. My boyfriend doesn't even really like fish and he kept stealing bites. I definitely recommend this place as a must! It is definitely a nice dinner (price wise) - Entrees were $20-$27 and appetizers were $10-$15 It was worth every penny!

I finally was able to stop by again with C, a House first timer. We had a 30 min. wait on a Thursday ~6:30pm, which is not surprising. We got to explore the area a little bit. I don't know why, but I get a bad/unfriendly vibe from the maitre d. She rarely smiles and seems constantly stressed - I guess it is pretty stressful running a busy restaurant and maybe she was having a bad day, but for such a highly esteemed establishment, I guess I expect a little more. Our server was definitely more friendly than the one I had last time. She was really sweet. We had the terriyaki rib eye and the sea bass with garlic noodles. The rib eye was different from the one I had last time and wasn't as good. It was a little charred on the outside, which turned bitter in my mouth and masked the natural flavor of the meat. The sea bass was, like everyone says, amazingly soft - it felt like butter in my mouth. But my absolute favorite part of the meal was the garlic noodles, I could eat a WHOLE bowl of them. Although this House experience was a little disappointing in comparison with my amazing first time, I would definitely come back. It has so much potential for being one of my favorite restaurants.

Crap...where has this place been the past however long that the house has been open???

ÊReminded me of pepper lunch in milpitas...but the chicken was cooked absolutely perfect...the right amount of seasoning...and a heaping plate of noodles. ÊSuper addicting. Ê And then my dish...the winner winner. ÊI had the wasabi noodles and pork. ÊThe server told me the pork is cooked medium. ÊI heard my mom's voice in my head saying that you have to cook the crap out of pork in order to prevent any foodborne illness...I wasn't about to say no to the recommendation of the chef. ÊI said sure, why not? Ê That had to be some of the best pork I have EVER had...it was juicy...seasoned well...gosh I'm salivating just thinking about it. ÊThe noodles weren't overpowering with the wasabi...it was done so well that it just accented the dish. So freakin good!!! Ê And then dessert...we ordered the coconut creme bržlŽe with passion fruit...the first bite was like a huge palate explosion. ÊReally good stuff. Ê The service was fantastic...she had personality and was right on point. ÊI think they mostly get shirts and ties that frequent the restaurant...and also foreigners? ÊI tried to crack a joke when she asked how our dessert was. ÊI said it was disgusting...even though it was obvious that I licked the plate. ÊHaha. ÊHer face dropped for a moment and she looked really confused...wondering how I could say such a thing when there wasn't a drop left on the dish. ÊI had to hurry up and say I was just kidding! ÊShe was great though...definitely knew what she was doing and how to take care of the guests. ÊAwesomeness! Êoh, and the prices were extremely reasonable! 5 stars...one of my new fave restaurants...can't wait to come back again and try out dinner this time!

This place is delish! Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Please make sure you make reservations, its a really small place and you would definitely have to wait otherwise. It was cold outside and people were huddling up next to the small entrance. Once we sat down we were greeted with a little plate of pickled cucumbers. Our waitress let us know the specials of the day and got to look over the menu, which doesn't have at on of options but so many things sounded tasty. We had the fried salmon roll and grilled calamari (special) for apps. The calamari was perfect - not over cooked and chewy at all. It came with a tangy tomato sauce. The salmon roll was mostly cooked all the way. It looks like they just diagonally sliced the whole roll so pretty big serving. The sauce was great and so was the cabbage slaw that came with. I ended up ordering the special which was a miso black cod that came with a California and avocado roll. Again sliced diagonally length wise. The rolls were laid on top of the miso black code which was just so flaky and tender and delish! Below that was some broccoli which I thought was a bit too bitter for me. One of my friends had the wasabi noodles with flat iron steak which I had a taste of. The noodles were great! They used udon type noodles (a fav of mine) and it was mixed in a sauce that had a taste of wasabi but not the overpowering spice of it! Yumm all around! Food came out of the kitchen pretty fast, and the intimate setting was really nice. You could actually hear the convo you were having - loved this place.

It is not hard to understand why The House received so much love. The food here is a happy Asian American love child. Not pretentious. Not being hard to get. Just really down to earth good food that made excellent use of both Asian and American elements. You got to give credit to 'fusion' food that is done right. Granted I don't love every single dishes I have tried, most were more than delicious. The Kurobuta Pork Chop was likeable. It was a bit bold and quite showy but definitely made a lasting impression. Deep-Fried Chicken Liver was alright but slightly underwhelming. Seared Scallop with Creamy Crab Meat Pasta, a special of the day, was not as memorable as the dishes on the regular menu. Mango Tapioca was a classic Asian dessert and I am glad they did it well. Key Lime Pie was terrible. I hated that biting bitter sourness. I don't know what happened there. Like many restaurants in the area, parking could be hard to come by. Seating is very limited too because the restaurant is quite small. Do plan ahead and make reservations.

"Oh me oh my!" It's hard to figure out what this place should be considered as since it's pretty much a tiny hole in the wall, going up a slight hill, nestled a block away from China Town. ÊIt's pretty much almost impossible to spot the place out unless you know you're going there. ÊEither way, this place has to be one of the best dining experiences I've had so far in my life! The first time we came here, my friend's relative that lives in NorCal introduced us to, THE HOUSE. ÊIt was closed LOL. We didn't get a chance that day since it was full of exploring and sight seeing and such. ÊI believe we came back the next day and finally stepped foot into this fine establishment. ÊYet being so tiny and confined since the seating was limited to about 10 or so, the ambiance of the place completely nullifies that. ÊIt's really nice being in there and the staff is good. Moving on- The dishes were very interesting as I've never had Asian fusion before of this quality. ÊMy friend's relative mentioned a Pork Chop dish, that seemingly wasn't on the menu, at all. ÊSo I guess it was a seasonal dish maybe? ÊBut they were able to make it anyways. ÊWe all order different dishes and had some appetizers but I don't remember the names of them since well its about a few years since I was there (this review is years behind LOL but I have pictures! ÊJust check them out and salivate) So I'm going to be talking about the pork chop a lot, gonna tell you right now haha. ÊIT WAS DELICIOUS. ÊThe currant reduction sauce was out of this world. ÊThe presentation was amazing. ÊThe Chop itself was juicy and the flavor was jizz in my pants. ÊI just couldn't believe how good it really was. ÊWe told the workers there we're from Long Beach and we drove all the way here just to eat here, which is pretty much a half truth. :D Fast forward another year or two, we're all back again here at the house and the guess what? ÊThe Pork Chop is now on the menu haha. ÊIt was a Kurobuta Pork Chop with pomegranate and currant reduction sauce. ÊWe had it again (of course) and it was still delicious. ÊI honestly couldn't stop thinking about it for about a week after consuming it haha. ÊI honestly can't wait to come back and have it again, along with any other new specials or items. (The chop!) http://www.yelp.com/userÉ THE HOUSE!

This place was a gem, I would give it 4.5 stars!!! With so many raved reviews and recommendations, I was so excited and in the end it was simply amazing. I didn't give it five stars because there was a couple of dishes that was okay for me. - The pork chop: this was my favorite dish, cooked with perfection and tasted so yummy (5 stars) - Sea bass: I thought it was good, thought a little bit dry. However, the flavor was there (4 stars) - Uni special: I didn't really like it because it was served on some kind of radish bed, it was better off with rice (3 stars) - Soft shell crab: it was tasty, can't really go wrong with deep friend stuff (4 stars) - The ribeye: my second favorite dish of the night. The meat was so succulent and well cooked (5 stars). - Bean Tempura: yummy yummy (5 stars) - The garlic noodles were really good here, must try (4 stars) - Oysters: it was really fresh, loved it (4 stars) - The chocolate cake was just okay for me, nothing special (2.5 stars) Overall, I would love to come back!!!

This was the second time I've been to this establishment and again, was not disappointed. Service was great... a cheery Thai waitress was our server and was very friendly and attentive. We enjoyed... Steamed mussels (we literally drank the broth after consuming all the mussels) Pork Chop with pomegranate - currant sauce and mashed potatoes. This was mine and the presentation and taste was fabulous. A little more fat than I'd normally like, but the sauce was so good and the pork so tender and juicy, I barely noticed. Came with some beautiful flamboyant plaintain chips. Grilled Seabass with garlic ginger soy sauce, garlic noodles and grilled asparagus. I stole a few bites of this and the sauce was amazing. The fish very light and buttery. Steak. Also stole a few bites of this...no complaints. Super flavorful. Chicken Breast. Did not try.. but my picky 13 year old sister absolutely devoured it. Dessert selection seemed average. Decided to venture elsewhere. Only con... parking in North Beach. Was it worth it? Without a doubt.

Came here for dinner after hearing and reading rave reviews but I was pretty disappointed with the food and service. ÊHere's what I had: Fried calamari - I asked for extra tentacle, but was given zero tentacles. ÊAside from the waitress not listening to my request, the calamari itself was so blah. ÊI could've gotten much better calamari at Cheesecake Factory. Ê1 star. Wasabi garlic noodles w/ skirt steak - Noodles were soggy and the wasabi wasn't distributed evenly so I nearly choked after eating a bite of noodles loaded with wasabi. ÊThe steak tasted old, like it was about to expire within the next hour. ÊEven though I was hungry, I didnt' even want to finish my food. ÊI took it to go and had no inclination to bring it for lunch today. ÊYuck. 1 star. Summary = this place is totally overrated. Go to Chapeau or Luella instead, the food quality there far surpasses The House.

What is it about this place that's able to find the perfect combinations that make my taste buds smile? ÊGreat execution of Asian fusion dishes. Even after 12+ years, The House still shines. Between a 7pm reservation we had and 15 min later, the whole place practically filled up. The two friendly servers spouted out the days' specials, which contained at least 6 items (wouldn't it be easier to print a daily special menu insert rather than spending 5 min reciting it for each table? Just saying ... For apps, the tuna tartare with chips was delicious and delicately flavored with spices. The pan fried scallop appetizer special was expertly cooked as well, although they were slightly fishy. For mains, the sea bass pleased as always, with flaky white meat absorbing the juices and sauce so well. The accompanying garlic noodles were too saucy (def rec choosing the plain rice instead) and the snow peas were rather bland. Dessert-wise, the mango tapioca was frickin amazing! In comparison, the special Japanese pumpkin pie with crushes macademias was good but not as delicious. Good beer selection. Liked the Hitochino, red rice version. Turnaround for food is amazingly fast ( almost too fast). In and out in record time. Resos def recommended to avoid inevitable wait times.

I'm a little confused how this place has so many reviews and so little "hype." I don't have to call months in advance to get a reservation, people aren't talking about it all around me all the time, but by golly, there's a delectable Asian fusion restaurant smack dab in the middle of North Beach. The House should probably be called something more like "The Apartment," since I think square-footage wise it's smaller than my apartment. Grilled sea bass is definitely a must. Flaky, moist and just down-right delicious, you've got to try it. I've also sampled the specials (a crab/scallop risotto and kobe beef steak, plus the wasabi noodles are very unique). Unsung hero of the night was the tapioca dessert. Normally I dislike Asian tapioca-desserts but this cool, vanilla-ice-cream-like product coupled with fresh mango is absolutely to-die-for. Ê(Yes, it earns all those hyphens) As others say, don't dare showing up without a reservation and it's a 4 people or fewer kind of place.

REALLY small place. Things i've tried here: Tuna Tartare with soy chips - pretty good, they use a wasabi sauce which can be too strong for some people. I liked it. Crab cake - also had wasabi aioli under. I would like to taste more crab. they should have chunks of crab but its so mixed up with all the other ingredients its just a bit mushy. I ordered their seabass - seabass was really buttery and they give a good portion of it. I asked for noodles with it and i really like the texture of their noodles. It also came with a lot of snow peas, adds a nice crunch to my meal. Friends had: Pork chop with pomagranate sauce- the sauce is amazinggg.. taste like a bbq sauce with pomagranate juice. really goood with everything. wasabi noodles with slices of steak- my friend ordered medium rare... and it was like rare. No excuse because they get to slice it and see how rare it is. Overall the food is really good but I think everything was a bit too oily for my taste. I know people cook veges with oil to make them look yummy but too muchhhh!! :( TIP: make reservations!! I went on a Tuesday night and they only offered us a table if we would only stay an hour.

Fantastic Asian fusion food in North Beach. I've heard friends rave about this place, so I decided to try it out on my most recent trip to San Francisco. I came here with a few of my friends, so I was ale to try a little of each dish. We ordered a couple plates of the tuna tartare, calamari & the salmon roll to start. Tuna tartare had a bit too much wasabi for my liking (I strongly dislike wasabi). Calamari was good, nothing special. The salmon roll was also good. ÊOf these three appetizers, I would probably order the salmon roll again. For drinks, most of my friends ordered alcohol, except me. I ordered green tea & my tea came in its own little pot. On to the food: I had the Grilled Sea Bass w/garlic ginger soy. Came w/snow peas & noodles. The Sea Bass was perfectly grilled & moist. Buttery. The way fish is supposed to taste. I also had an opportunity to taste the mahi mahi, grilled salmon, pork chop w/pomegranate sauce & the rib eye steak. Everything was delish. ÊI don't think you can go wrong with any dish at The House. We all shared the creme brulee & tapioca for dessert. I found the caramelized passion fruit topping on the creme brulee a little tart, but the mango tapioca was a hit with everyone. Came out to about $50 per person.

I am not sure if it is my European taste-buds that are the issue here but in my opinion, there was nothing 'special' or 'great' about this place or the food (ok, there was one, but I'll come back to it later). I had the Mushroom rice with king prawns and if I am brutally honest, it was stodgy, bland and tasteless enough for me to only eat half of it. Putting that into context, I lick plates clean after almost every meal and often get forked in the elbow from table neighbours as I lean across to help finish their plates. Yeah the decor was clean and simple, and the service was good, but based upon what I ate I am not sure I'd want to go back...sorry. Now, to the one 'great' thing that was also a bit freaky: on top of my dish was this really fine papery stuff that when it got warm (from the food it was sprinkled on), it started waving and moving around making the dish look like it was still alive. It freaked one of my friends out but I found that pretty cool.

Yum yum yum!! I will definitely eat here again. Small place so it can get a bit noisy, but also romantic. I'm a dork and loved the little house cutout on the menu (my boyfriend kept thinking he'd spilled something because he'd just see it out of the corner of his eye). Scallops: Delicious appetizer and beautiful plating. Scallops cooked perfectly, great sauce. Octopus salad: The octopus itself wasn't cooked well but the rest of the salad was great. We just ate around the octopus (maybe order without?). Wasabi noodles: I LOVE wasabi so this dish was perfect for me. I had leftovers and was very excited to eat them for lunch the next day. Fish special: Sorry, forgot what the special was but it was delicious. I have a feeling it would be hard to get a bad dish here. Creme brulee: I think this was a fruity version? Regardless, remember loving it and happy to end the meal with a lighter dessert that was quite tasty.

It's not the most romantic setting, but The House definitely delivers some awesome food. The Ambiance: This place is pretty small and loud. It's not the best place to have an easy conversation without raising your voice a few times. The decor is pretty simple and sparse, and doesn't quite match the caliber of the food (but being Asian, and used to Asian places, I didn't really care too much). One unusual aspect of this place was that they seemed to give you time limits on your table. As patrons were walking into the door, the hostess would say "We can seat you as long as we have to table back by __ o'clock". Even though we made a reservation, we were still told that we had an hour and a half limit at our table. I understand that this system allows for more efficient seating and maximizes the number of diners per night, but it feels odd to be pressured to finish by a certain time. The Food: Fried Salmon Rolls ($9): Each serving came with four "pieces" (two long and two short) of the roll. The rolls were cooked just enough for the salmon to remain slightly raw on the inside, which was awesome. Dipped in the hot mustard, it was a flavor explosion in your mouth. Grilled Sea bass ($26): Following a personal craving for sea bass recently, I had to try it out, and it was very good. Generous portion of fish with a nice grilled flavor. It wasn't the absolute best melt-in-yo'-mouth sea bass I've had, but it was pretty damn close. The garlic ginger soy was tasty, but salty, so be careful and don't just douse your fish in it. The noodles and snow peas that complemented the fish were done well, and comprised a filling and satisfying meal. One friend got the Angus Ribeye ($25), and as a bonafide steak lover, definitely enjoyed his generous cut of meat. another friend got the Pork Chop ($23) and was also satisfied with his meal, particularly the pomegranate sauce that came with it. Ê Service: They allowed us to sit at our table while two of our friends went to find parking (parking blows around here), so that was cool. The waitress was brisk, and waters were refilled on several occasions. The food came out at a pretty good pace, which supports their notion of turning tables over in a timely manner. Overall, no real complaints here. Although I get suspicious when a place boasts "Asian Fusion", The House will not disappoint in treating you to some awesome food without superfluous frills.

HmMm, Asian Fusion at it's best! We had dinner reservations for a party of four, but we still waited approximately 30 minutes for our table. I am not too sure whether they are punctual with their reservations, because there were a few other parties with reservations that had to wait as well. I guess it doesn't hurt to make reservations anyway though, because the restaurant is tiny and it can get really crowded and cramped. The menu was very brief with one dish that really stood out to me, the warm wasabi house noodles with Angus flatiron steak--so naturally I went with that! We also ordered two appetizers to share: deep-fried salmon roll with Chinese hot mustard (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) and the blue lake bean tempura (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É). The appetizers were beautifully presented and tasted wonderful. The deep-fried salmon roll was warm and buttery. The blue lake bean tempura was lightly battered and deep-fried to perfection. The main course, the warm wasabi house noodles with steak (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) was bursting with flavor. The warm wasabi noodles left a brief and subtle burning sensation in my mouth that was quickly neutralized with the steak and slaw. The steak was a little on the chewier side, but edible. I sneaked in a taste of my girlfriend's grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) and it was heavenly! The sea bass was so crispy and blackened on the exterior, but still very flaky inside. The staff was very knowledgeable and attentive. I am usually skeptical of Asian Fusion places, because their food is always lacking. The House is far form lacking; I was very impressed. I do recommend giving them a try!

This place should be called the Hizzzouse because this place is just perfect. All I got to say is everything that we ate was amazing! We got the Salmon roll and tempura lobster tail for appetizers; the Kobe beef New York cut and sea bass for entrees. The appetizers were delectable. The salmon egg roll amazed me because it had so much salmon in it. First off there were 2 pieces cut into halves, so 4 pieces. They were basically salmon with egg roll batter. Don't get me started on that hot mustard sauce...it was so good with a perfect amount of spice. The tempura lobster tail was a special and it basically melted in my mouth even though it's fried in tempura batter! Sheesh. Seabass - look at everyone else's review. You cannot go wrong with this piece of crunchy on the outside and super-soft on the inside. The dipping sauce... I wish I could put that on every fricking fish I ever eat. Bomb! The Kobe Beef New York Cut... is to die for. It was worth every penny I paid for it. The meat was perfectly cooked at medium rare and the sauce complimented the meat very well. If you're ever in the area, go here, but make reservations first. It's about .9 miles from both fisherman's wharf and downtown. I know because I walked here from downtown and to fisherman's wharf afterwards. This place is cray-cray good and I wish I could give this place 1 million stars. ;) (RIP Whitney Houston)

I'm going to add to hype and say that this is place is pretty awesome! We made a reservation for 5pm on a Saturday (which is when it opens), arrived 15 minutes late because we couldn't find parking, and found that the place was already 3/4 full. I would say the entire place could probably seat around 50 people - it's small, but not a hole in the wall. At the recommendation of all the reviews, we order the pork chop and Êthe sea bass. Both were very satisfying, but different, and therefore need equal attention. - The sea bass was soft, almost like it was steamed, but crispy on the outside from the grill. It was accompanied by garlic noodles, which I didn't not find very interesting, but still the overall dish was inspiring. (~$26) - The pork chop was accompanied by a pomegranate sauce, fried taro/yam chips that towered over the mash potatoes, and a few pieces of asparagus. I enjoyed all of it to the bone. (~$22) Even though I did sneak off 1/4 of my bf's sea bass, I think I enjoyed the pork chop more because it really isn't too hard to cook soft fish. It's all about timing and steaming. And my momma taught me right! We ended the dinner with the chocolate cake that was topped with a scoop of coffee ice-cream (to test these yelp reviews), and it was great! the consistency of the cake was soft and almost brownie-like. (~$8) For the romantics: Mood-lighting happens after 5:45 pm (when the sun sets).

The House is great for both lunch and dinner, but I much prefer to eat here during lunch because it's cheaper for about the same portion and there's fewer people, thus shorter wait time. Main entrees served during lunch and dinner vary. There's always about 3 to 5 specials of the day, with oysters most likely being one of them. Also, depending how late you eat dinner and if you wait outside the restaurant, you may encounter some crazy, drunken panhandlers. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the flatiron steak with roasted shitake mushroom sauce (lunch item). HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! Very tender steak, cooked to your desired perfection. Ask for medium well, you get medium well. The mushroom sauce is AMAZING. It's sooo creamy and delicious that I could lick the plate clean if no one were looking. I also love their oysters, both cooked and raw, and their spicy cilantro mignonette sauce served with them. It's packed with so many flavors, definitely giving your tongue a tickle. I'm somewhat thankful The House is such a hassle to get to from the other side of the city, or else I'd be eating here weekly.

My friend's mother made reservations here a week ahead and heard it was good. The first time I came here was I believe about five years ago. I don't remember much from then,but I did remember the restaurant was small and we waited for a while. I've heard even though you have reservations you might have to wait for a while, about 30mins. Without reservations you could be waiting for easily 2 hours. So I suggest making reservations. Parking is always crazy so after we found a spot we headed to The House. It was pouring rain so we got seated right away. So if it's pouring rain, it's a good time to go. We were seated and immediately served drinks. They give you a small plate of cucumber pieces soaked in vinager that was really good. Only thing is that they charge you if you want more. We ordered our food right away. My girlfriend ordered the seabass, which sounded like the most popular according to yelp. Her mother ordered the steak, and I ordered the Ono. The Ono was delicious and looked like a scuplture. The seabass was delicious with the yummy mashed potatoes. The green beans however were not so great. With my meal I had the lychee black ice tea and it made my meal taste better. For dessert we ordered the coconut creme brulee, chocolagte truffle cake, and the apple crisp. My favorite was the apple crisp because it was warm and delicious with the vanilla ice cream. The creme brulee was good, except for some burnt parts on the sugar top. The chocolate truffle cake was a little too rich for me, but it was perfect for my girlfriend's mother so she ate it. Overall service was good. I've heard from friends and family that they haven't gone back because of the horrible service from their last visit. I on the other hand had great service and a great meal. It's on the pricey side so its good to go every once in a while.

I came here for a friend's birthday last night. ÊNow, it's not that this place is bad, but I don't really understand the hype everyone's said about it. ÊIt's ok, but it's nothing special. ÊAnd I dunno, I don't know if $26 for a pork chop is really "reasonably" priced. ÊI was expecting something more imaginative, more...infusiony.

RESERVATIONS A MUST! They only hold the reservations up to 15 minutes and then they will try to accommodate you as needed. ÊParking in the area is tough so come early. This is a very small restaurant in the north beach area, which can get pretty crowded so beware if you are claustraphobic! ÊThe decor is very simple and clean but the food makes up for its simplicity. ÊAsian fusion has always made me skeptic but this place proved me wrong. ÊThe dishes are plentiful and very well plated. ÊI must emphasize very WELL plated for a little restaurant like this. ÊIt would make you feel like you are in a fine dining dinner but in a smaller scale venue. Ê What we ordered: 1. Deep Fried Salmon roll with chinese hot mustard- I loved this! ÊIt felt like I was eating an eggroll with medium rare cooked salmon in the middle, which is hard to master. ÊThe chinese mustard sauce, take it a bit at a time. It definitely is strong! 2. Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak- I was scared for the challenge of eating wasabi noodles but this was nothing to be feared! ÊGreen noodles with a hint of wasabi, which went well with the steak. ÊIt wasn't overpowering at all! ÊDefinitely unique in its combination! 3. Chicken breast with roasted portabella white truffle oil sauce- the meat was so moist and tender. Êit went perfectly well with the mashed truffle sauce potatoes that came with it. my boyfriend was absolutely in love with it We didn't get to try their desserts but we will definitely next time when we are in the city! ÊDefinite must to try in SF!

OMG OMG OMG! This place is amazing!!! My husband and I were in San Fran for the night and used Yelp to find a restaurant in walking distance to our hotel with great reviews, which brought us to "The House". We did not make a reservation, but I suggest that you do. It was a Weds night and The House was PACKED! We only had to wait 45 minutes for a table, but you know it is a GOOD sign when a restaurant is packed on a randome weeknight. The food here is PHENOMENAL. My husband and I started with the dumplings which were delish! And I had the sea bass while my husband had the steak. Both were OFF THE CHAIN. The quality of the food here is outstanding and so flavorful. Staff is friendly and attentive. If we are ever in the San Fran area again, we will definitely be back to The House!!

Uninspired. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing. Friend had the hamachi which was the special of the day. Wife had the chicken dish with truffle oil. I had the grilled sea bass with noodles. Men. I've experienced better. And they sat us at 6:10 and said we needed to go by 7 pm.

The House benefits from its charming exterior and prime location in North Beach. It is seemingly a tasteful date spot in an intimate space. This restaurant was a disappointment for me on all accounts. The food is not horrible but it was the kind of meal you would expect to have on a first class UA flight. I am surprised to see that this place has 4.5 stars and many reviews. We ordered the flank steak with garlic noodles as well as the truffle kobe steak. The asian fusion felt forced; the steak was cooked well but it was layered with needless sauce creations that masked the natural juices of the grass fed beef. Such a tragedy. It's like like forcing a Betty Johnson dress on Audrey Hepburn. If you are remotely claustrophobic and value hearing your companion(s) over dinner, this is not the place for you. It's an uncomfortable tight and loud space. There is much better food in the city however, I'm prettty sure this place will continue to be popular.

Great place for a special occasions. Reservation is recommended and parking on a street is difficult, but there are 2 parking lots right around the corner. Yesterday (Chinese New Year) I take my wife for her BD and Valentines day celebration. Because of the traffic (Chinese New Year Parade - big deal in SF) we were 20 mins. late for our 9 PM reservation (I call 5 days earlier for reservation and the earliest time was 9 PM) & we had to wait a little. But it was worth it. Kobe beef steak on special, ÊShrimp dumplings with Chinese chives ÊPork chop, Blackberry dessert and bottle of Australian Shiraz - everything was very good.

I went to The House for my birthday and immediately I saw the wait outside. I was lucky that boyfriend had a reservation because I could tell that without it, it would be a looooong night. As soon as we got in some girl began mean mugging us and whispered " they won't be seated, the wait is too long." RUDE. I guess she gets cranky when she's hungry. We did get seated because unlike her we had reservations. ÊMAKE SURE YOU GET A RESERVATION! You need it. My boyfriend and I ordered the salmon rolls and the tuna for appetizers. Okay, so maybe I'm crazy but the salmon roll was not that good to me. I didn't get the hype. The tuna on the other had was excellent. We ordered the garlic steak and sea bass for dinner. Both were bursting with flavors and the garlic noodles were perfect as a side. They tasted like a 10X better version of the garlic noodles at P.F changs. Overall, this place is worth checking out. -1 star for the salmon roll and not giving me dessert for my birthday. They told me if I bought my own dessert then they'd give me a candle. That wasn't a good present.

The food here is great! I love coming here, although it is a bit heavy on the wallet... I usually have a reservation when I come here to eat since this place is really small and has very limited seating. So either get there early before the rush or make a reservation ahead of time. I've been here twice, and both times I have had a pleasant experience. Both times I have ordered the Wasabi Noodles and the Sea Bass. So good. I can't even describe how good the sea bass is. Once it's in your mouth, it's like heaven! And the wasabi noodles. Amazing! I'll always order these two here. I recommend it! It's been a while since I've been here so my review isn't as recent as I would like it to be. But from the recent reviews, it seems that the wasabi noodles and sea bass is still the popular items!! Food is a bit pricey, but well worth it. Yum!

If the food in my own house was as good as San Francisco's The House, I'd never leave home! I'd also be 400 pounds but it would be worth it! Located in North Beach, The House is one of the few non Italian joints in the area. This tiny place has very limited seating; I would say it can hold a max of 40 people. I think reservations are a must. The dŽcor inside The House is simple and elegant. The menu here isn't too large but everything they serve is beautifully presented and tastes amazing. My wife and I were so torn on what we wanted to order as our main entrees we decided to order three and split them, along with an appetizer and a dessert. This is all we ordered from The House; Kobe beef papaya salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, pickled radish, fried crispy rice and a light vinaigrette http://www.yelp.com/biz_É Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy sauce w/ garlic noodles and grilled green beans http://www.yelp.com/biz_É Kurobuta pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce w/ mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus http://www.yelp.com/biz_É Warm wasabi house noodles w/ angus flatiron steak and Kimchee http://www.yelp.com/biz_É Chocolate truffle cake w/ vanilla ice cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_É Every dish we had was exploding with bold flavors. Out of all the dishes I had, my favorite was the Grilled sea bass. It was perfectly cooked and melted like butter in my mouth. Actually, every meat here is perfectly cooked, super tender and extremely flavorful. The pork chop dish was great, especially the pomegranate currant sauce it was sitting in. The wasabi noodles with steak, which was recommended to me by my buddy Kent D, Êwas great too. The noodles had such a great flavor. I could have eaten bowls and bowls of those noodles alone. The chocolate cake was so rich and decedent. It was a great way to end a phenomenal meal. The prices here aren't bad considering how fantastic the food is and how large the portions are. The service was top notch as well. Honestly, I have dined at many restaurants in SF and The House could be my favorite thus far. My entire experience at The House was flawless. I can't wait to go back again.

Our last meal in San Fran during our 5 day visit.... no regrets. The decor was simple and unpretentious, the service was stellar and the food delicious. I would definitely visit again on my next trip! I was impressed with their beer selection (not a large list, but great choices) and had a Chimay red. The SO had a lychee iced tea that he wasn't as impressed with - I suspect he was supposed to mash up the one lychee to get the lychee taste, but he didn't want one mashed up lychee. Would have been better if had 2 or 3. For appetizers, we ordered the scallops and the salmon roll. Both were tasty and we were quite pleased with them! As for mains, he got the sea bass (which lives up to all the reviews on yelp) and I got the wasabi noodles. MY BIG ADVICE: DO NOT order the salmon roll AND the wasabi noodles. Firstly, the salmon roll comes with a wasabi-based dipping sauce, so I couldn't even taste the wasabi in the wasabi noodles (until I cleared my palate with some of his white rice). Secondly, the slaw that comes with the salmon roll is the same slaw that comes on top of the steak on the wasabi noodles. This was actually pretty disappointing - as good as the slaw was, I was ready for something a bit different and I felt like this was an opportunity for the chef to present something new. I guess there was one regret ... I should have gone with the pork chop =/ But all in all, it was great fusion food (and I'm pretty picky when it comes to Asian fusion)

ÊEveryone knows how hard it is to make a good pork chop, but this was absolutely 100% perfectly cooked. ÊMeat was tender and juicy and well seasoned.

For the four years that I've been coming here, The House has never failed me. I think Anthony Bourdain should definitely come here for the Layover episode of San Francisco (I haven't seen that episode yet but if he doesn't want to miss out, The House is the place to go). If you haven't already done so, please try the pomegranate pork dish. You won't consider that a mistake in your life--so do it! Sad to say, the pork chop is so good, that for the four (maybe five) times I've been to The House, I've always ordered the pork dish. I will for sure order something else next time though. My date ordered the curry udon noodles with chicken (not sure if this is only on the lunch menu). But I couldn't help myself from drooling over his noodle over my plate of pork chop. This does not mean that you shouldn't try the pork chop or that the curry udon noodle is better, they are both equally as good--it just means I need to not order the pork chop next time. Anyway, you leave feeling really content. My favorite hole-in-the-wall place in SF. :)

This is my favorite restaurant in San Francisco. Everything I've eaten here has been good. Every time I've eaten here, the food has been solid. Last night, we ordered appetizers from a list of their specials and it was AMAZING. The lobster tail with salad was spot on. Their scallops were perfectly cooked. Tender, not stringy, not watery and melt in your mouth flavorful. Also, why is their sea bass SO GOOD?!?!?! Where in the world do they get this magical sea bass? I think their sea bass is on crack or something. How in the world do they get their pork chop to be so juicy and flavorful? The only thing I would tell anyone to pass on is the dessert. Their dessert tastes like something I can buy at the supermarket.

The value for the quality of the food and taste is seriously unbeatable. ÊMy GF and I walked there for lunch after we toured Alcatraz...and the reviews are right, The House is Unbeatable.

ÊThe Chicken was the perfect temperature and the vegetables were very fresh. The Shrimp and white bean dumplings were flavorful...but they were just steamed, believe they would have been better if they were pan fried with a slightly crunchy noodle.

My fabulous bf took me out for my b-day to this uber cool Asian fusion restaurant. He made reservations but we still had to wait to get seated because it was PACKED.

I ordered the Grilled Sea Bass with garlic ginger soy and my bf ordered the Angus Ribeye Steak housemade teriyaki, toasted garlic butter dish. Both were really good. I got my bass on the wasabi noodles and I have to admit that it was a bit heavy. I wish it came with a light side. The noodles overpowered the fish. We also got dessert.

I came here for Christmas Eve dinner without a reservation and waited about 30 minutes if not less. I am guessing we didn't have reservation because my date said so but he was tricking me that night so don't count on it. The owner was walking around checking in with everyone. I think this is the first time I ever seen this happen at a restaurant. Its a nice touch to a quaint place. This place is tiny. It gets packed fast. Lights are dimmed for dinner. I'd suggest dressing up a little bit for dinner. White cloth napkins. Ê Ê I wonder if there was something alive on mine because later that night I noticed a little bump on my lip where I distinctly remember wiping. But no worries it was gone the next day. I had the salmon dish. It's a slice of salmon on a green veggie island in a bowl of broth with rice on the side. The salmon was delicious. It is nicely seasoned and cooked to perfection (not under or over cooked). I'd love to come again to try the salmon wrap and the pork chops. They were out of pork chops by 8pm.

The House may very well be the upset winner of our recent San Francisco trip. Asian fusion can really be a question mark of a category, but this place nailed it. We came here for lunch, and just to be safe, called ahead to get a reservation. We were seated promptly, and were given some delicious cucumber pickles (hint: save half of these to clear your palate at the end of your meal). We ordered the warm wasabi noodles with salmon. The noodles had a nice kick, and the veggies tossed in gave the bed a nice crunch. The salmon was seasoned and cooked perfectly--really moist. We also tried the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. It came with a side of flash-fried green beans which were amazingly flavorful. The noodles were similar to our other dish in form, but had a sweeter flavor, instead of spicy. As for the sea bass itself: wow. Again, it was cooked to perfection with a nice crust on the outside, and a firm, yet juicy center. We didn't really use the black bean sauce on the side, as the meal had enough flavor without it, and could really stand on its own. The House really knows how to cook a piece of fish. We were really impressed, and definitely recommend it!

I've been to some high-end Asian fusion restaurants, but I think The House may top them all - and judging from the packed house that my fiancee and I arrived to on a Friday night, it's a pretty popular place to eat. Definitely call ahead of time (it doesn't have to be weeks in advance), or Êyou'll end up waiting for a bit - and there's not really a lot of space to stand if you're waiting. Service here is very quick, and the waitresses are on the ball with knowing the specials. The food, for lack of a better word, was breathtakingly delicious. For appetizers, we had the oysters - of which I'm usually not a big fan, but the cilantro sauce added a dose of spice that really added another dimension to them. The kobe beef tartare and uni flatbreads were delicious as well. The beef was delicious on its own merits, but I really liked the uni on top of a piece of avocado - both are foods with smooth textures, and the flavors blend really well together. The entrees were great as well. I had the kurobuta pork chop; I'm usually not a huge fan of pork, but this was cooked to the right tenderness and wasn't overly fatty. It also came with a pomegranate currant, which was less fruity than anticipated (which was good) but added a slight twinge of sweetness to the dish. My fiancee had the miso grilled cod, which was perfectly cooked - the cod fell apart so quickly and was extremely tender. Lastly, the desserts - the Japanese-style pumpkin pie was fantastic. I can't pinpoint the main difference, but the natural sweetness of the pumpkin vs. the somewhat artificial canned pumpkin that is sold in the store was the main difference. The chocolate truffle cake was also delicious as well, particularly with caramel drizzled on top. This is definitely one of my all-time favorites that I've been to. There are a lot of other interesting items on the menu that I'd like to try out sometime as well, and I do hope to come back when I'm in SF again.

Great place to go with friends. It's casual, yet intimate. I took the in-laws here with the hubs for a little dinner celebration. Food was great. Steaks, wasabi noodles, and seabass. Service was good too. I would give this place 4 stars, but it's quite cramped in there and since it's so busy, they pretty much tightly line up the reservations so we felt rushed to leave after finishing our dinner. I'd still go back though!

With so many reviews and such a high rating, I expected more from this place. ÊHad dinner here a couple weeks ago with some friends and was disappointed. ÊNothing was really bad, but nothing was really good either. ÊThe service was good and I had a good time, but it was more about the company the the restaurant or food. ÊSome dishes I remember are.. Beef Salad: Wasn't exactly what I was expecting. ÊContained fruit and not really any greens. BBQ Oysters: I thought there would be more to this dish, but its literally oyster with BBQ sauce. ÊThe BBQ sauce was okay, but I thought the combination of BBQ sauce and oysters left something to be desired. Mushroom Rice with Grilled Prawns: This was my favorite dish. ÊThe rice was flavorful and creamy. ÊDelish! We ordered so many more dishes, but these were the best or most disappointing for me. ÊParking is hard to find. ÊWe ended up parking at the garage by the police station on Vallejo. ÊIt's not that far and I believe $3 an hour.

I officially dub 'The House' as my new favorite Asian Fusion place. My amazing boyfriend catered to my obsession with Asian Fusion by taking us here for our monthiversary! Our reservation was for 7:30 and we were seated right away when we walked in. For drinks, I had two glasses of their Sauvignon Blanc and he had two glasses of the Chimay beer. Don't know what Chimay beer is? Don't worry, I googled it for you. It's a Trappist beer. Trappist beer is beer that is brewed in a Trappist Monastery under the control and responsibility of monks. Revenue goes to social service. It's a Belgian beer. I tasted it and thought it was pretty damn delicious! Very easy to drink and got Vincent buzzed after just one hehehe. Our drinks were all $8 each and totally worth it. We ordred two appetizers to start. First, we ordered the selected oysters on the half shell with spicy cilantro mignonette. Yes, they were raw. Then, we ordered the deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard. Your mouth should be watering right about...now! The oysters were SO GOOD. I've never had such amazing oysters. They were very fresh and the sauce had a nice kick to it. The deep-fried salmon roll sounded so simple, which it was, but it was also jam packed with flavor! The chinese hot mustard sauce was amazing. I had to drench my salmon roll in it. Both appetizers blew my mind. I think that it is absolutely imperative to use great quantities of both sauces when eating these appetizers because they really take the dishes to another level. As for the entrees, we ordered the warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak and the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. We had the steak cooked medium and it came out perfectly. The steak was tender and delicious. I really liked the wasabi house noodles as well. You could definitely taste that wasabi flavor, but it didn't overpower the dish by any means. There were also some cabbage on the side that were really well seasoned. I don't even really like veggies, but I loved whatever they put on that plate. The sea bass was AMAZING! It was cooked so well. I like sea bass because it's got this buttery flavor to it. That dish also came with some noodles as well as snap peas. The dish also came with a sauce similar to soy sauce, except a little bit thicker. Salty and delicious! I was so impressed by this place. The food was out of this world and service was great. Even though it was crowded, we were checked on consistently throughout the night. It couldn't have been better. It's definitely on the pricey side, but it's so amazing. I really really really really hope my boyfriend takes me back here soon! I really hope he's reading this because I AM ALREADY FIENDING!

I'm not sure what everyone's raving about. Sure, the deep fried Salmon rolls were tasty and the Apple Pie was the "best thing in the meal," but that's not really a complement. The clam chowder tasted OK but the main course seabass had none of the signature butteriness due to overcooking. The flank steak, between being under cooked and gristly, made the table jump whenever we tried to cut through it. The pile of garlic and wasabi noodles lacked flavor and felt a bit greasy. Maybe it was was an off night, but three of five dishes missed the mark, including the two mains. I won't be back unless someone else is paying.

4.5 stars One of the best restaurants in SF. ÊFlavors are bold and yummy, better than Bobby Flay for sure. ÊTook the family here for my wife's birthday dinner. ÊHere's what we had: Appetizers: Pan seared scallops, medium rare. Paired with pinot gris, Ê5 stars Himachi crudo, 6 stars Unagi, 4 stars (just had fresh bbq unagi from Japan, cant beat that) Crab cake, 3 stars (tasty but not lumps of crab that you expect from a 4-5 star restaurant) Entrees: Pork chop with promegranate currant reduction-heavenly! W/ pinot noir, 4.5 stars Seared tuna, 4 stars Black cod, perfectly grilled, 5 stars Sea bass, great sides of noodles and green beans, 4 stars Dessert: coconut creme brulee with passion fruit sauce: 4 stars Excellent meal, perfect portions and very tasty! ÊI'm still dreaming about the himachi crudo....

Call me crazy but I thought the House was decent, meaning - not horrible but not something that makes me salivate the instant I hear "The House." It was our first dinner destination in SF, but I do not have dreams of what the food would taste like again... In all fair honestly, we tried majority of the plates, family style. Miso seabass with wasabi noodles. Neiman pork chops in a pomegranate currant sauce Seared ahi tuna Angus ribeye Wasabi noodles with flat iron steak Presentation is beautiful. Service was okay, but I can't blame them because we came in when they were doing last call on a Monday night. Maybe, I'll give it a second shot the next time I'm in SF but for now, my cravings for "The House" are satisfied.

I made a reservation at 7:30 and was promptly seated. ÊI guess I was lucky because many of the reviews complain of long wait times even with a reservation.. We had this sushi eel thing which tasted like...sushi. ÊThis was good, but tasted like they used imitation crab. ÊGood, but not top quality. We Êhad the cod for an entree which was phenomnal. ÊExtremley fresh and not dry like most places serve it. The ahi entree was also good. ÊIt comes rare and tastes great. The one thing that makes this place good is the sauces they use. ÊThey enhance the flavors of everything! Warning: I ordered a beer, but they brought me out a 3/4 full beer, it seriously looked like someone took a giant sip out of it. ÊI'm sure it was probably the bottle, but the thing that weird was, A. they didn't pour the beer in front of me and B. tasted like Asahi beer instead of some blonde beer I ordered. ÊThe waitress assured me I was drinking the right beer so I let it go. ÊSo make sure they pour the beer in front of you!!!

Again...not sure how I've never reviewed this place?? I've been going here since they first opened their doors last 90s, and amazingly they are still producing the same great quality food as they did from day 1. The only reason why they don't get 5 stars is because of the size of their location...you definitely can't be afraid to be cozy in this place...especially with strangers. Our table for 2 was mashed between a table of 2 and a table of 4....definitely cozy. It sometimes feels as though you're eating off of your neighbors plate :) but that's what brings people back here perhaps...very cozy...hence the name i guess..."the house" Things to never miss: - Oysters - Grilled Sea Bass (the noodles are always perfect) - Seasoned Rib Eye - House Salad (the dressing is light while the citrus isn't overwhelming) - every bite of the salad is very refreshing. - Wines by the glass can use some help...and overall selection....but for SF, the selection is well priced.

One of my all time favorite places in San Francisco. ÊIt's a tiny little place, and you must have reservations. ÊA long long time ago, there were two locations, one in the inner Sunset (I think that was the original location) and this one in North Beach. ÊThis restaurant has always been fantastic. ÊAnd there's always an excellent choice of wine. Ê My boss from many years ago introduced me to this restaurant. ÊShe mentioned that she grew up in the same area as the restaurant owner. ÊMy boss' family was also in the restaurant business, so she knew the owner of this restaurant really well. ÊThe first time I went there, she introduced her small group of employees to the owner. I was so pleasantly surprised by the uniqueness (especially for that time) of the Asian fusion idea. ÊAnd I'm really not a fan of Asian fusion food, but this place is the exception. ÊI try to come here every year, and this restaurant has never disappointed. ÊEverything from the food, wine, and the wait staff - superb. Ê Perhaps most importantly, I think this is the perfect date spot.

Yum! I been to The House for the first after hearing many friends rave about it this past week. ÊWe came here for my boyfriend's actual birthday dinner. ÊThe location itself is difficult to find parking and the place is relatively small, probably not ideal for a large group and it's slightly dim. We had the Ahi Tuna Tartare and crabcakes as starters, I had the infamous grilled sea bass and my bf had the domestic Kobe steak special of the night, and we ended with creme brulee and the apple pie for dessert. Ahi tuna tartare = I did not like this dish at all. I hate wasubi!! I absolutely hate it. ÊI wished they would had listed a litte more detail of this dish on their menu because if i knew it was mixed with a wasubi sauce, I would have gotten something else. Ê(This is the factor of the 4-stars rating) Crabcakes - these are not your traditional patty-shaped crabcakes, it's more like a pear-shaped. The crabcake was a good size for two and had some sort of tartar sauce on the bottom. Seabass - OMG is all I can really say when the sea bass entered my mouth. ÊIt was juicy and good and went well with the garlic ginger soy sauce, which I was a little skeptical at first because I was worried the ginger would be too overpowering. ÊAnd the noodles it came with was... well let's say this, thinking about it is making my mouth salivate. ÊYES, its that good. Steak - well it tasted a little too fatty for me but maybe I just gotten a bad end of it but my bf enjoyed it. Creme brulee - This was listed as a Coconut creme brulee with passionfruit puree but I didn't really taste any coconut. The passionfruit puree was really light on top but contrast will with the creme brulee. ÊI love creme brulee and this was good creme brulee Apple pie - I had a small bite of it and it was actually warm, which is how apple pie should be and it's not the usual pie but it had those crumbs on top. This was good apple pie and I usually don't like applie pies. Service was attentive and dishes were nicely made.

How could I not try this place after seeing over 2000 reviews & such good ratings?? What a wonderful find...thank you fellow yelpers!! Be warned - this place is small and a little cramped & reservations are a must. Came here Saturday night & the place was packed but was pleased that we were seated right away. I have to say the service throughout was also excellent which amazed me since the place was packed - they are doing alot of things right it seems... They brought out some pickled cucumbers to start off with. We decided to skip the alcohol and try the lychee ice tea and found it very refreshing. For starters we shared the shrimp & chive dumplings and the deep-fried salmon roll. I am not a huge shrimp fan but still enjoyed the dumplings - the chive was a bonus. The salmon roll on the other hand...oh wow so good!! They do not skimp on the salmon but watch out for the Chinese hot mustard sauce...that hit me when I dipped too much of the roll in it. For dinner we narrowed down to the glazed salmon in the sake broth & the grilled sea bass. I was craving noodles and it totally made my night when the server said the sea bass comes with either garlic noodles or rice...awesome!! The sea bass was just cooked perfectly - soft, moist, and just flaked with the fork. The cooks definitely know how to make this right!! The green beans were cooked well - not overdone so had a nice crunch & very flavorful. The salmon was also very good. The broth though has a nice spicy kick to it - must have some chili flakes in there. We could taste the chili but it definitely was mild enough to not overpower the dish. And then yummy dessert - so many looked good but we finally picked the coconut crme brulee w/ passion fruit puree. This just hit the spot - sweet, sour, & crunch all in one...we left very happy!!

The food was good but not great, too greasy, and certainly not worth going back for. ÊThey serve farmed salmon instead of wild caught. I had the mushroom rice, it tasted good, if you like butter and cheese. They should call it, "Rice and Cheese", I couldn't eat it even though I was really hungry. The hostess was quite rude and snooty. Our server was nice but couldn't answer a single question we asked about the menu items. The rave Yelp reviews are undeserving, in my humble opinion.

It's a SIN and a huge disservice to yourself if you haven't tried this place yet... I considered leaving an essay-style review, but there's already enough of that available to you. ÊI'm here to tell you that after 6 years, this is STILL my favorite restaurant in SF. ÊIt's by no means cheap, but it's a STEAL for the consistency, quality, presentation, and service. ÊSo for the price, it's darn hard to beat! For my entree, I've only ever gotten the Kurabuta pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce because it's THAT good. ÊI've tried most of their other entree offerings from the plates of friends and I was no where near disappointed. Ê As for the appetizers, try them all! As for the desserts, try them all! (I would especially recommend the coconut creme brulee with passion fruit puree) If you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert, you're looking at ~$60 a person after tax and tip. ÊGET AT THIS PLACE! ÊRegardless of party size, be sure to make a dinner reservation. ÊFor larger parties, 6 or more, do it about a week in advance.

Its New Years Eve. Ê RSVP at 7:30pm, seated at 8pm. ÊBut I will still give them 5 stars for their service and food! We waited half an hour long, but the hostess was thoughtful and comped us a Salmon roll with this Asian style coleslaw. ÊAnd yes, it was yummies! For dinner: Fried pork belly - It was a bun with a slice of fried pork belly tucked in the middle with a hoison sauce. ÊYou can then add veggies to it. Ê"Soft" on the outside and "crunchy" on the inside. ÊIts almost like a Pekin Duck Bun. Very flavorful. Ê- Like Duck entree - Now this was super duper yummies! I can still remember the flavor that burst in my mouth. ÊI thought the mash, asparagus, blackberry, and the sauce worked really well with the Duck. ÊIt was cooked to medium rare; just perfect for me! ÊAhhh- phenomenal. ÊIf you are a "duck" kind-a-person, definitely recommend trying this. Pork entree - It was flavorful, but not enough for me. ÊIt still tasted a bit bland towards the inside and a bit dry. (But that's pork for you.) ÊNot too crazy about this one. Finished off with a glass of Pinot and I'm good for the night!

Unfortunately, for all of its hype, I was not overly impressed with The House. ÊIt was good, but just not up to all the rave reviews I had heard about it. After a friend (who is a major foodie) mentioned it to me, my boyfriend and I decided to try it. ÊIronically, once we were inside the place, both of us realized we had already come here to eat before!!! ÊApparently, it must not have been that memorable, which is why neither of us had remembered that we had already tried it before. Ê Really can't remember what we tried the first time there. ÊThis last time that we went, I had the wasabi noodles, and the BF had their uni clam chowder and sashimi. ÊMy boyfriend did think their clam chowder was really good. ÊI liked the wasabi noodles -- tasty & kind of spicy --- but just didn't find the overwhelming WOW factor that made me want to go back. Overall, good, solid food. ÊI just don't find it overly memorable, or a place that I still think about afterwards.

Despite everyone's rave reviews about House, I'm not ever that impressed with their food. After dining there three separate times, I've concluded that House gets 3 stars. This time I ordered a special - the kobe beef with mashed potatoes and greens. The beef was so chewy that I had to spit some pieces out. However, I only did the opposite with the mashed potatoes. On a positive note, for apps, I did like the chicken liver salad with its toasty chicken liver crunch. The ahi tuna strips are also always good. And in their defense, my friend is a huge fan of the seabass entree. I applaud the House for their coconut creme brulee as it was extremely decent. Will return for Apps and Dessert only.

Q: How do you know you really like a place? A: When you make a reservation for your next visit during your current one. Yep, I am smitten with The House and grateful that I made it a last minute addition to my "to eat" trip hit list. The place is small and a not-so-hidden gem, so you're best served making reservations. On both visits, my dining companions and I opted to skip the specials and focus on the regular menu items. The menu consists of an assortment of starters and mains, by sharing we were able to try a nice cross-section of the menu: *Ahi Tuna Tartare - excellent, one of the most flavorful tuna tartares I've ever eaten *Deep fried salmon roll - delicious and the chinese hot mustard will do wonders for any congestion! *Maine crab cake - inventive presentation and teeming with crab. This was the one dish I would've passed on, but only because it was too rich for me. *Steamed mussels - good, but average compared to the other items I tried. *Grilled sea bass - OMFG, how do they make this fish so moist and juicy?! The fish practically melts in your mouth Served with udon noodles and green beans, it's a can't miss dish. Did I say OMFG? *Grilled ahi - not as amazing as the sea bass, but still an excellent dish. Generous amounts of ahi are presented over sticky rice and spinach. We capped off each dinner with a slice of chocolate cake. Dense and rich, almost fudge-like, and served with coffee ice cream it was amazing and a perfectly decadent way to cap off an already decadent meal. Service was friendly and prices seemed reasonable for the quality and quantity of food delivered. The House is definitely on my short list of places I would love to return when I get back to San Francisco.

A long time ago, The House used to have a second location on Irving. That location was not very good from what I remember. You can't survive charging $20+ for Asian fusion in an area highly populated by Asian restaurants. So anyway. My friend made a reservation for a belated birthday dinner for herself / early birthday dinner for me. We were told we would have to give them back the table by 8:30pm. While I understand that this is a small restaurant, I do not like being rushed. I'm one of those people who eats, notices a crowd and says to my group "hey we should get going, there's people waiting." Since I anticipated The House rushing us, we went ahead and decided we wouldn't bother with dessert at this restaurant. Good thing because the dessert menu wasn't impressive anyhow. Well.. What can be said about The House that everyone else hasn't said? It's pretty good and worth the money. I had the sea bass and it was delicious. Although it comes with a ginger soy dipping sauce, I barely used it. The fish was tasty on its own, how I believe fish should be. Flat iron steak w/ wasabi noodles was good also. My friend ordered the rib eye w/ garlic butter and that was super good. If you want to eat here, a reservation is HIGHLY recommended.. but don't be shocked if they tell you what time you need to be done eating. A little off putting and pretentious isn't it?

Oh man, this place is dinky! ÊSo make sure to place a reservation before you come. Other than that, the food is awesome. Ê My girlfriend and I started out with the deep fried salmon rolls. ÊI can see why it's a popular item, since the crispiness was just right, and the salmon was of good size. ÊInterestingly, the mustard dipping sauce that accompanied the rolls was probably my favorite part. ÊIt had a great tangy but spicy taste to it as well (probably had wasabi). For the main course, I ordered the Kurobuta Pork Chop W/ Pomegranate Currant Sauce. ÊThe Pomegrante sauce was heavenly. ÊIt was savory, but had a citrus and meaty taste. ÊUnfortunately the Pork Chop was a bit overcooked and a bit too chewy, but the sauce made up for it. ÊMy girlfriend ordered the duck with a blackberry reduction. ÊHer duck was cooked a lot better than my pork chop, but the blackberry reduction wasn't as great as the pomegrante sauce. Ê Whoever the Saucier is at The House, is really talented.

Truly DELICIOUS! ÊExcellent Service! I came here for lunch without a reservation because I didn't want to fight the dinner crowd. It was 1pm and my friend and I got the last table available to the little restraint. This made us super happy because we didn't have to wait. I am sure at most times this would not be the case. We shared a salad with fried to perfection fish salad as an appetizer, and each ordered an entree. I had the steak from an iron plate and my friend had the glazed salmon. Both tasted fantastic. The steak was tender and thinly slices while the salmon to grilled to perfection. We ended lunch with the creme brulee. The sugar was thinly torched and every bit melted in to my mouth. Sadly I didnt not like the sour sauce that was on top on the sugar but overall it was still good. Not too sweet, just the way I like it. The waiters were super friendly and refilled our water when needed. The decor is romantic therefore I feel that it is very date appropriate. I will definitely come back and try out their dinner menu next time.

Though I'm giving this place 5 stars, they did do something that really drives me crazy! ÊMy friend and I are enjoying our appetizers, we're on the last one and there is one large plate between us and then we each have our own small plate with fork and knife. ÊAll of the sudden, the waitress comes up and tries to take away our small plates, fork and knife...we both ask her not to saying "no, wait, we're not done!!" ÊBut she took them anyway saying she had to because she's bringing out our main dish. ÊI thought this was really pushy ... she brought us a new fork and knife a couple minutes later and we had to have the rest of the appetizer both cutting and forking in the middle of the table. ÊJust seemed really silly and rushed. That said, the dumplings were amazing, the salmon roll was incredible and the flat iron steak on noodles was fantastic, spicy and absolute heaven! Ê Love this little restaurant, great food and can't wait to come back and give them another shot....I just hope they don't rush me through my food again.

The House does Asian-fusion in such a beautiful and delicious way. Usually Asian-fusion places try too hard but The House definitely gets it right. My sister and I shared an order of classic fried calamari and it was the best calamari we've ever tried. The breading was not greasy and it tasted great. Even with the lemon squeezed on top, the calamari never got soggy. I don't know what they do with it but it's great. I ordered the seared ahi-tuna and it was SO good. The pieces were the perfect warmth and thickness, the spicy sauce around the edge had just the right kick, and the rice and veggies were fragrant and delicious. I finished everything on my plate. I haven't tried everything on their wine menu but they definitely have a delicious selection from what I've tried so far. They really know how to pick out their wines. Overall, my experience was wonderful here. The service was polite and prompt and the atmosphere is very soothing. There is definitely a crowd because this place is popular but the noise level never got too bad. The House is a great place for a date or a small party.

It was a chilly Sunday night and I suggested that the boyfriend and I go to Brixton for dinner. He said sure, made reservations and we were off. We walked a couple of blocks until I thought to myself, this doesn't look like the place... "SURPRISE! We're at The House!' "WTF YO! YEW LIED TU ME!" Oh well... we were seated quickly and everything on the menu sounded delicious. I ordered the chicken breast and honey ordered the steak with wasabi noodles. I wanted to order the wasabi noodles but I thought that the wasabi would overwhelm my food. Definitely not the case. There was just enough wasabi for a kick in the noodles and the steak was fairly fresh, except for one bite. My chicken breast was delicious and had beautiful garnishing and even yummy mashed potatoes underneath! We also had some chocolate dessert? Don't remember what its called. Definitely will be back with a group of friends. :)

Delicious. ÊI came here with a friend after hearing all the hype. ÊThe place is cozy, a little too cozy. ÊVery small, should be renamed to "The Room". ÊOther than that, everything was great. ÊService was attentive and they take reservations. ÊWe got the calamari to start, which I must say, was the best calamari I've ever had. ÊShe got the wasabi noodles with steak and I got the sea bass. ÊThe noodles had a zest to it but wasn't overwhelming. ÊThe sea bass was cooked perfectly and was complimented well by the greens and the sauce. ÊI was actually surprised the prices weren't that bad, considering it's in North Beach. Ê I recommend this place!

Apparently they don't really understand the definition of a "reservation". ÊIt means to reserve a table for you do you don't have to wait when you get there. ÊI made a reservation 4 days ahead of time, but when we arrived exactly on time, we had to wait another 30-40 minutes to get a table! I don't care how good your food is. ÊIf you don't know how to manage simple reservations you don't know how to run a restaurant. ÊSo even if you make a reservation prepare to wait anyway. Êcompletely ridiculous. Furthermore, the host did not even so much as apologize for the wait. ÊIn fact, she simply asked for our name and didn't tell us anything for 40 minutes. The waitress also came out too early with our entrees, and literally took our appetizers away while we were still eating it. Ê And the Wasabi noodles are WAY over-rated. ÊThey aren't that good at all. ÊI could hardly taste what was "wasabi" about it.

HANDS down my FAVORITE restaurant in SF. ÊThis is what I recommend to all my friends when they ask me where to eat in SF. Reservation is a must, it is a rather small restaurant and they don't often take walk-ins, although I have seen a few lucky individuals score openings. Ê This is some of my favorites. ÊI would keep the party size small, since they don't have a lot of tables for large parties. ÊOnce went with a party of 6 and got squeezes into a 4 person table. Appetizers: Deep fried salmon rolls: filling and skin ratio is good, pretty generous with the salmon. Ê Kurobuta Pork cheek buns: devoured within minutes, wish there were more. Tuna tartare: flavors are simple and straight to the point. Entrees: Pomegranate Currant Porkchops: The dish that won me over, I believe this is the perfect example of asian fusion. ÊThe porkchop has a hint of the spices and flavor that my mom use to make her porkchops and the pomegranate give it that hint of acid and sweetness. ÊMust try! Sea Bass: my second favorite dish, the noodles it comes with..drool..and the vegetable has been different each time I've gotten it Miso Cod: The California rolls that come with it are very interesting, definitely the only time I've seen them served like that. ÊAlso yummy. Unfortunately their desserts aren't that memorable. ÊBut, the restaurant is located in the heart of North Beach, there are tons of cafes within walking distance with great pastries or small gelato shops. Service is good, almost too good, they clear the table and have the next item on your table within minutes, doesn't allow much time for digestion. ÊAs long as you don't feel hassled by this, you should still have a memorable dining experience. Parking in North Beach is horrendous, really make sure you leave enough time to look for parking, or else fork up the money to park in a private lot.

Favorite restaurant in SF so far, I love this place! I've been here twice and luckily both times we didn't have to wait more than 10 mins for a party of two. So far I've had the chance to try: Deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy Hand's down favorite would have to be the Flatiron steak w/ wasabi noodles for the range of flavors. But everything tasted amazing and the service was awesome!! I would definitely go out of my way to stop by here every time I'm in SF.

This is one of my favorites in the city, but my other half thinks it's just ok...so it averages out to 4 stars. the wait is ridiculous here...twice recently we've put our name down and we were called an hour after the promised time! The sea bass is great. Did not enjoy the wasabi noodles with flatiron steak...the meat was really tough. They didn't do anything about it though when we voiced our opinion.

As humans we tend to remember things better than they really were. So, in my mind, the true test of a good restaurant is whether or not it's as good the 2nd time as it was the first. I've been to plenty of restaurants a 2nd time only to walk out a bit disappointed. I went to The House the first time several years ago with my family. I don't remember many details other than that I had lamb and we all thought the meal was spectacular. When I returned to the House a few weeks ago with my husband an in-laws, I was worried it might not live up to my memory. But boy was I wrong! This place was just as good as I remembered. My husband and I split the Ahi Tuna Tartare appetizer -- it was absolutely amazing; I'd highly recommend it. My in-laws got the fried salmon roll which was also good but definitely would take 2nd place in my book. For an entree I had the "Sesame soy glazed salmon in a bonito sake broth" and the fish was cooked to perfection. We almost didn't get dessert, but I'm glad we did! We had a chocolate truffle cake which was absolutely UNREAL. I've never had any kind of cake that tasted like that. My husband and I are still talking about it. The House is some of the best food you can find in the city for the price and the service is excellent as well. Just don't expect to walk-in without a reservation!

Been here 2 times and it's a 5-star experience every time! ÊNice little hole in the wall type place in North Beach. ÊThe House is Asian Fusion at its best and won't disappoint once you get past the crowd of people standing in line. ÊAmbience is pretty classy and upscale, but at the same time pretty casual. Ê Made reservations beforehand for prime time spot during 6-8 pm and once we got there they sat us at our reserved time. ÊFor the main entry, me and my friend ordered the Deep-Fried Salmon Roll with Chinese hot mustard and Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. ÊThe Sea Bass melted in my mouth with every bite I took! ÊThis isn't your ordinary Sea Bass, it's Chilean Sea Bass! ÊThe salmon perfectly complements the sea bass with that kick of mustard. Ê Ê For dessert we got the Coconut Crme Brulee with passion fruit sauce and Deep Fried Bananas. ÊThe crme brulee is sweet and creamy. Highly recommend the House for it's exquisite taste and ambiance.

The eternal question: sea bass or black cod? I vote for the cod. You'd expect the sea bass to be a fattier fish, but the cod is by far more buttery and flaky. If you really can't stand California rolls, though, either find someone at your table who does, or else pick something else because -- to its credit -- the restaurant doesn't shirk on the sushi portion. The sea bass comes with more distinctive sides, and it's a meatier, more robust filet. Still good, but if you're expecting the sort of fluffy, lightly-grilled whitefish you sometimes get at other restaurants when you order sea bass, go with the cod. Everything else on the menu -- and I really to mean everything -- is terrific, and the restaurant's high rating is absolutely deserved. I especially like the chicken livers and the calamari.

THE #1 Asian fusion restaurant in SF. Trust me I'm a lawyer. Hah. Ok no really, I first tried this place in 2007, and most recently New Years 2011, and it's been able to retain its quality through the years. RECOMMENDATIONS/TIPS 1. Any seafood appetizer really, but especially the Maine Crab Cake or their specials. 2. If you're on a date with a girl (or guy) who aren't planning on testing their waist elasticity for the night, try 2 appetizers and split the entree. More flavor exploration and diversity for a little less dinero. Ê 3. Grilled Sea Bass. F*@% yes. This dish generates serious word of mouth. And while it's in there, it just literally melts away in these perfect flakes that disappear much too quickly. I never knew fish could be this tender outside of the raw variety. 4. A Riesling to go with that Sea Bass. 5. Don't count on trying to walk in for a seat. Make reservations at least 2 days beforehand if you want a decent time CONS - Don't expect anything service-wise past semi-attentive inquiries about your enjoyment of the food and making sure your water is filled. - Desserts don't quite match up to the quality of the main courses Ê - Good luck trying to find decent parking in North Beach. I usually end up at the garage @ Vallejo & Powell. PROS - Generally amazing quality for only $$ prices - Ambience is perfectly tuned for what kind of meal you'd expect there. Not too dark so you don't have to squint to see your buddies, but also dim enough for romance. - Speaking of romance, I saw McDreamy here once. I think he helped get my GF in the mood. Thanks McDreamy...I think.

First impression: Cute little (emphasis on little) place in a cute neighborhood. ÊI love venturing away from chain restaurants so I was pretty excited about trying this place. ÊThe wait was a little long even though we had a reservation, but it was bearable. ÊWe were promptly seated at the table right next to the door, which I was pretty bummed about because of the super tight squeeze against the divider and constant breeze from the doorway. ÊNext time I think I'll request a table closer to the back. The food: ÊWe ordered the scallops with microgreens. Okay, if I could rate this I would give it a 10. ÊThe scallops were cooked perfectly and the sauces and microgreens were in perfect pairings. ÊI ordered the special, which was the kobe beef with cauliflower and mashed potatoes. ÊAgain the sauces were the perfect compliments to the meat. ÊMy only complaint was the food wasn't piping hot when it arrived :/ The sauce was actually hotter than the meat. ÊFor me though, the flavors could not get any better. ÊFor dessert, we had the coconut creme brulee which I wasn't sure I would be fond of because of my so so feeling about coconut, but this was absolutely delicious. ÊJust enough sweetness and enough tart to cut the sweetness, yum! The service: Our servers were pretty good about refilling our water and keeping us updated on our orders. ÊOur food was prompt which is amazing considering how busy this place is! Overall, I think the sauces at this restaurant make the meals, meaning I couldn't imagine anything I had without it, nor would I want to have it without. ÊThis is a place that leaves you feeling kinda cramped eager to stretch , but kinda forget about it when your food arrives. ÊAfter a while though I was still wishing for a little elbow room and personal space. I'll be back soon so I can have a taste of the lunch menu!

This is such a little restaurant tucked away in a little section of Grant Ave. that I did not expect the flavors to be so big and bold. ÊWe had a shittake mushroom soup with truffle oil, seared toro tuna salad, Chilean sea bass, and a braised pork shoulder. ÊI loved most of the dishes, especially the two appetizers. ÊThe Chilean sea bass is seared really well, locking in all the flavors of this fish. ÊThe side of green beans and noodles it came with were mediocre though -- kind of like dressed up Chinese food a la P.F. Chang's. ÊThe braised pork shoulder had a piece of crispy skin fried separately and placed on top of the pork meat, which I loved chewing on. ÊThe soy broth it came with was so flavorful that I drank it all up. The House has their food presentation down. ÊEvery dish was plated in an artful way. ÊLots of people take photos of their food here...so bring your camera if you are one of those people who post instant photos to Facebook everywhere they go. 1 star off: Desserts need more work and creativity. ÊThe chocolate truffle cake just tasted like any frozen chocolate cake -- or a la P.F. Chang's as well.

Ok, before I get started on this review, please note that it takes A WHOLE LOT for me to take time out my busy schedule to write/blog a review and I am a "very-very picky person" (says my bf and family), so here it goes... First time here, I ordered the Ribeye ($23) along with the steamed mussels ($10). Can I say that they were both outstanding. I've never had mussels as delicious and soft and delicate like this one. Usually, I am kind of hesitant with ordering seafood when I'm dining out, but I am more than glad that I took a chance on these steamed mussels. It literally melts in your mouth. That was finished in less than 3 minutes! The ribeye- oh, where should I start? I am a meat and steak lover, had steak/beef almost everywhere you can imagine, but here, here is different. The ribeye was so soft and moist (had it well-done) and just melted away on my tongue. How else can I describe it? It was the best piece of meat I've ever had. My bf had the fried salmon rolls ($10) and he loved it. I, however, had a taste and didn't like it much. It wasn't bad, but TO ME, it tasted like any other salmon, but maybe because I am not a fan of salmon. My bf called me "F*ing crazy" when I told him how I felt about it som don't let my opinion of the salmon stop you from trying it. Came in for lunch the other day and had the flat iron steak ($15) that came with mustard greens, mashed potatoes and some kind of delicious sauce. Hands down, my favortie dish! I admit, at first my heaert sank when I realized that the steak was sliced instead of whole because I figured it'll be dry. However, as soon as I stabbed my knife and fork in it, my heart was up and pumping again! So delicious and again, it just melted in my mouth. So tender and juicy and the sauce, the mashed, and the greens just compliments it. The bf has the pork loin sandwich ($9) which he said was good, but not great... obviously, because he digged right in my plate as soon as he was finished with his. I've been dying to try the grilled sea bass($25-27) which LOOKED super delish. NOTE: Highly recommend that you make reservations before you come or else you'll be drooling over people's food while waiting.

My bf and I decided to come here for our anniversary dinner since we have heard good things about this place and its in our neighborhood. Ê It definitely helps to make reservation since they do get packed and the place is generally small and cozy. I made reservations the day of on a Saturday and was able to get the time I wanted. Ê After arriving 15 minutes early for our reservation, we were seated 15 minutes later at the time of our reservation. ÊThe waitress is caring and seems like she cared about our needs as apart of their restaurant experience. Ê We ordered raw oysters which consist of what I believe to be Kumamoto which is more of the grimier ones with a strong aftertaste. Ê We ordered the kobe beef skirt steak that came with mash potatoes and the recommended sea bass dish from yelp reviews. Wow, I am so glad we did. The sea bass's texture is perfect. I would recommend to dip only a tiny bit of the black sauce that resembles sweet soy sauce as it will be too salty. The sea bass came with stir-fry udon. It was a bit salty. Ê I was really pleased with their wine selection. We each ordered a glass of Piesporter Riesling, Reuscher-haart, Mosel, Germany 2008-very sweet and a glass of pinot noir, Country Line, Anderson Valley, ÊCalifornia 2009- buttery and not dry. Our bill came out to be about 100 dollars. Entrees ranged from 18-28 dollars. Wine came out to be 12-14 dollars a glass. I dont recall what the pricing was for the oysters.

The House may very well be my favorite restaurant in San Francisco. Since I live nearby, I come by for Saturday lunch almost every other weekend and it's a great way to start the day =p. I'm really writing this review so I have a record of different things I've eaten there. Deep-fried Salmon Rolls: Two rolls of salmon wrapped in seaweed & deep-fried. Slice diagonally before serving for a stunning presentation. Spicy mustard, crunchy seaweed, and juicy salmon makes this an instant favorite. Uni Clam Chowder: As a disclaimer, I like the earthy sweet taste of uni. As the waitress(who's awesome) put it, it's not going to change your mind about uni, but if you like it, this dish is for you. The uni goes phenomenally well with the clam chowder, I'm amazed at how well the two flavors go together. All the other ingredients are fresh and add different perspectives to the soup. When I bit into one of the small potato bits, I finally realized how much a simple potato can add to a dish Grilled Seabass with Garlic Ginger Soy: The seabass was well seasoned on it's own, so you must have some of it without the sauce first. However, once you dip it in the garlic ginger soy sauce, you really taste how the two flavors combine (like that scene in Ratatouille). Awesome!!! Grilled Chinese Chicken Salad with Soy Vinaigrette: Normally, I don't like salads, but the Asian-style grilled chicken goes superbly with the soy vinaigrette. Add in really tasty greens and you have a salad worth ordering.

At first, I thought that The House was a little bit out of place in the Italian district, but it definitely holds it down when it comes to taste! I went with a group of friends who suggested this place over E & O Trading Company. There was a bit of a wait on a Friday night, but I found it completely worth it! The deep-fried salmon roll was a delicious appetizer! I'm definitely ordering it again when I'm back in SF. The sauce that came with it was the perfect pairing, just be prepared for a little heat! The crab cakes were perfect, but a little hard to share. I ordered the Angus Steak with Wasabi Noodles, and to say that it did not disappoint would be a wild understatement. The texture of the meat was exactly what I wanted for a medium rare cook. I picked little bites off of my friends' plates, and the Sea Bass and the Pomegranate Pork Chops, were both amazingly delicious. I really don't think it's possible to go wrong with the choices at this place!

The Grilled Sea Bass with Garlic Ginger Soy is a *MUST HAVE*. If you only go to this restaurant once, you need to order this dish. Be sure to pay close attention to the server when they announce the specials of the day. I've been pretty impressed with every dish here and I typically order something off of the specials menu to share with the table. Be sure to call ahead early to make reservations. If you don't have a reservations and you are a walk in, they will call your cell phone when your table is ready.

With a burning desire to arrive on time for our reservation, The Mad Hatter mercilessly threw me on the back of his motorcycle and we sped down the freeway. I held on for dear life but lost my innards and therefore my appetite on 280 somewhere. Ê I was especially defensive when we arrived to the venue which was no more than 5 blocks from my work. "Great" I murmured. I more than anyone hate being taken to amazing places by my work for fear they are like the other tourist traps in the neighborhood. It had all the elements for a tourist trap. Quaint, modern take on contemporary steakhouse. It just screamed caesar salad for $10 and $10 to add chicken. Ê Needless to say I was wrong, ÊI was agog with admiration after dinner here with The Mad Hatter. To start we had the ahi tuna tartare, deep fried salmon roll and the maine crab cakes. To be honest, the appetizers weren't phenomenal or anything memorable. However, the opposite holds true for their main dishes. For our entrees we both got steak, I had the angus rib eye steak and he had the special, new york steak with sauteed mushrooms. All were presented beautifully and I could barely contain a smile with the first bite of every dish. I don't think I've ever had such a perfect steak. You will not be disappointed here, even after the bill, which totaled at $150.00 Expect it to be crowded with little to no elbow room and everyones conversation dominating yours because the venue is relatively "quaint" and very busy, very popular.

Shockingly, on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend - we found parking on Grant, just a few stores up from The House for our 12:30pm reservations. ÊAfter reading hundreds of reviews about wait times, etc, I was amazed at how quickly we were seated, and the fact that half of the restaurant was empty upon arrival. Ê We went for 3 of the starter specials: ÊToro Nigiri, Scallops, and Kobe Beef Tartare on Crostini. Ê FYI, all of the starters we had came in 3's. ÊSo if you're dining w/just 1 other person, you'll have to Ro-Sham-Bo for the 3rd and last piece, or if you're dining w/2 other people, you're fu6ked- because you'll definitely want more than 1 bite of the creative deliciousness that The House gives you. ÊAnd the presentation! ÊThe presentation of the food was absolutely beautiful. ÊThe Toro was fresh and fatty. ÊThe Scallops were seasoned with what I think must've been called Hella Slammin Yummy Seasoning Packets. ÊAnd the Crostini that the Kobe Beef Tartare was placed on? ÊCannnnnnnnn I marry you. After realizing how small (but wonderfully tasting) the starter specials were, we were still hungry. ÊSo we went ahead and ordered the Unagi Avocado Sandwich. ÊOH. MY. GAH. ÊIt's been repeated in hundreds of reviews on here already. ÊAs simple as the sandwich may sound, it's mouth watering good. ÊDo NOT doubt me on this one. ÊIs the Pope Catholic? ÊWhat'd I say. It's a small spot, but do yourself a favor and make reservations. ÊThey don't have pricing on their online menu, but everything we ordered ranged from $11-14 each. ÊIt's pretty reasonable for a place that serves tasty food prettier than some of the higher end restaurants I've dined at. ÊI told my friend, if I was ever mad at someone- they could redeem themselves by bringing me an Unagi Avocado Sandwich from The House. ÊFuture boyfriends: ÊTake note.

Let's call this review "Bringing Down The House", because I love Queen Latifah. Nothing short of awesome was my experience here, the infamous little trendy hotspot always sitting there sweetly off the lighted cusp of Columbus street. I finally got to the sweet penetration, and was not disappointed (as I'm sure most cherry popping's go). This place gets right to my threshold of trendiness, where before you taste the food you wonder if you're in for what I call the LA syndrome- all bark and no bite. Or that is to say, all design and no taste. Well the two appetizers we ordered- Fried salmon rolls and Scallops, proved all that wrong. They were so good, and really got me geared in for my entree. And alas! It arrives. Pork Chops in a Pomegranate Currant sauce. Soooo amazing. I'm such a sucker for anything involving pork (Judaism is *so* 200 AD) and this did not let me down. I also love pomegranates and currants, so that sauce was just more amazing good stuff jetting around my mouth (oh u kno). The service was nice too, not the highlight of the meal but who needs one with food like The House's. Gimme more!

Oh my goodness, this place is DIVINE. Made reservations for a party of 8 last night at 6:30pm. We were promptly seated. The two highlights of our dishes: 1) Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy ($26) http://www.yelp.com/biz_É My favorite dish of the night. My first bite of the meal was the sea bass. It was PERFECTLY cooked, and PERFECTLY seasoned. It melted in my mouth - I thought I was going to die and go to heaven right then and there. The sea bass is complemented with flavorful garlic noodles and tasty green beans. 2) Angus ribeye steak, housemade teriyaki, toasted garlic butter ($25) http://www.yelp.com/biz_É A steak lover's dream. This ribeye is enormous. Every bite is filled with garlic buttery goodness, and it rests atop a bed of seasoned mashed potatoes and kale (?). I loved everything except for the vegetable, which I believe was kale. It was dark and bitter. Service was quite good. They thought we had left behind a credit card, and called us immediately so we could get it. Even though it wasn't one of ours, I appreciated the call. While pricey, the portions were large and I left extremely full and satisfied. I ended up paying $32 after tax & tip. A few tips: 1) Maximum 2 credit cards per order, so bring cash if you come in a large party 2) Parking is incredibly difficult to find, so come early if you want to make your reservation. 3) There is a no-show fee for reservations, so they will take your credit card # down when you make it.

Not as good as I remembered it when I went way back when but it was familiarly good. I liked the wasabi noodles with the flank steak. I had my steak medium rare and it was tasty, although I would have preferred to have it sliced thinner. I tasted the pork belly and it too was pretty good with a good helping of meat and vegetables. The flavors melded in pretty well and there was a good balance between sweet and savory. The tuna tartare was delish. It was fresh and the wonton chips added good crunch and flavor to the entire dish. The place was filled up at 6 pm (an hour too early for me to eat) but due to a concert at 9, we had to get reservations way early. Perhaps my palatte had changed a bit- I did like the meal but I did not find it superb. Maybe another dish another time? There were many other dishes that seemed appealing such as the sea bass and crab cakes. Definitely reserve seats in advance, the place is very popular and seating is sparse-it's a teeny place. Parking is a pain so get there way early to have sufficient time to park. Prices are on the higher end and portions run on the larger scale. Our waitress was nice and helpful.

To sum it up: Great food, a little pricey, cozy space. The restaurant is really small and was all full when we arrived for our reservations. And it seems like it is a good idea to make one before you come otherwise you may have to wait a bit. We ordered the Asparagus appetizer, Steamed Mussels, Grilled Sea Bass, and Pork Chop. The Grill Sea Bass was delicious, moist and flavorful. The Steamed Mussels has an amazing broth that I wish I could have just drank with a spoon. The Pork Chop was cooked well and was balanced nicely with the pomegranate currant sauce. Overall, I had a great experience here. Even with the slightly pricey bill, I was Êcompletely satisfied with my meal and my belly was happy. One a side note: It definitely would be a good place to impress a date.

The House is a refreshing reprieve from all of the Italian places in North Beach. From the outside you could easily pass it off as nothing special, but don't be fooled - it is a fusion gem. The menu is great offering both small bites and meal-sized portions. My boyfriend and I always order one of their main dishes and then split a few tapas sized plates. My favorite is the rock-lobster tempura. It is not super cheap but also not totally overpriced. We can get out of there for under $40 with a drink each if we plan right. If you like Japanese or seafood you will love The House!

I'd say this is one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco. ÊI LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Ê Been here about 4-5 times and loved it every time! ÊI always order the same dish...the Grilled Sea Bass with Garlic Ginger Soy Veggies and Noodles. ÊThis is probably one of my favorite dishes in the world!! ÊIt never disappoints me and I finish it every time! Ê(I barely finish my dish all the time.) I had my birthday dinner here last year and our table ordered almost every entree. ÊGot to try the ribeye (my boyfriend's favorite dish here), pork chop, and the blacken cod with sushi. ÊEverything was delicious and worth trying. Last time I came with my boyfriend, we ordered the clam with okras appetizers. ÊI was a little disappointed on the dish since I usually have high expectations for this restaurant. ÊThink I can go without this appetizer next time. ÊFor entrees, he ordered the night's special of the strip steak. ÊThat was no disappoint either. ÊHe said it might be his new favorite dish there. I'm no different - ordered the sea bass! The restaurant itself is super small and the tables are really tiny. ÊThe ambiance is dim lighting, but can get a bit loud among all the customers. You definitely need to make a reservation upon going and I highly recommend bringing friends along with you.

Tried to make reservations for today (Tuesday) on Saturday night... nobody ever picked up. I left a voicemail as it told me to and that the reservation desk would get back to me... never did. ÊTried Sunday... nobody picked up again. T tried today (Tuesday) thinking I'd give it one last shot... and surprisingly someone picked up! Called around 1pm and asked if it were possible for a reservation at 730 for a table of 4... surprisingly they had space. WOOT! So first time here after seeing all the yelp reviews and even my sister told me to try it out. Parking... can be a total nightmare here. Especially since its on a one way street... be ready to circle around a few times especially during busy hours like dinner. Appetizers, shared the oysters on the half shell. It was decent, the oysters weren't bad, but they weren't amazing either. What did it was the spicy cilantro sauce that it came with, but looking around at the other tables, I may have been happier with another choice. Also shared the classic fried calamari, now that was good. Definitely worth ordering! Finally, my main was the warm wasabi house noodles with the angus flatiron steak... medium rare... droool. It was really good. The sauce was a bit salty, so near the end the noodles that absorbed the sauce made me beg for more water (figuratively speaking). But everything on the plate complimented each other when you ate it in one bite... the noodle, the steak, and the salad on top. The meal was filling and good. I didn't try my friends dishes but one of them ordered off the special and the other two got the kurobuta pork chop and said they enjoyed that as well. Definitely worth giving this place a try. It is pretty small in there so I would recommend reservations (if they ever pick up that is). I'll be coming back!

We ate there on Christmas eve and it was packed even for our 5pm reservation. I liked everything about The House! They opened on time, seated us, and gave us a list of numerous daily specials (would be nice if they printed it or put on a board) as well as the menu. There are so many dishes there I would like to try, it will require multiple visits. ÊThe wait staff is friendly and efficient and they didn't blink when we asked to substitute salmon for flatiron steak in the noodles dish. The barbecued oysters special was out of this world, and the salads were crisp and dressed just right. The entree was excellent, salmon cooked perfectly! ÊWe had a special desert too - a pumpkin pie with macadamia nuts and it was fantastic. I just wish they'd lease the empty space next door to make it a little bigger, but then again, I'd hate to disturb the operation of this perfect little restaurant.

This place is GREAT! It is small so you probably want to make a reservation. The food was some of the best we had on our San Francisco trip. We ordered the tuna tartare and soft shell crab appetizer. Both were delicious. For the entree, we shared a black cod special that came with a soy reduction sauce, california roll (with real crab meat) and chinese broccoli. Out of this world flavorful and the fish was cooked to absolute perfection. We'll come back here time and time again whenever we are here. I hope it Êbecomes a main stay for the area.

This rating, without even setting foot in the door? Well, I *would've* included a food review if I could... I called two weeks ago and made reservations for last night (Saturday) at 9pm. Called ahead about 8:40pm to let them know we were running late, and the woman who answered the phone revealed that she had no reservation for me at all. In the middle of the process of her making me repeatedly spell out my first and last name *and* give her my phone number twice, she kept saying, "Nope, can't find you!" (I mean, wouldn't it be obvious on first check of just two of those three details?) She sounded really annoyed, like she was doing me a favour, and said I couldn't dine there at all that night as they had no free tables. At this point I told her that that was fine, that we could obviously find something else, but that I would be putting on my Yelp! review that they'd "lost" my reservation. (Good thing we didn't actually get over there only to find we were outta luck!) Then she got quite rude -- "Miss, I *told* you, I don't *have* anything here for you! Do you want to eat here, or NOT?" Of course, her having just told me that there was no way for me to dine at the restaurant that night, I wondered aloud how I could possibly eat there if there were no tables... (I also mentioned that I'd be adding her rudeness on to the review.) At this point she got flustered, denied telling me they were full, and told me she was going to pass me on to the hostess (... but... but... if she wasn't the hostess, then why was she answering customer phone calls?) -- who told me I could come in at 10:15 if I wanted. That was a nice possible resolution, but we decided not to accept the offer, and went elsewhere instead. As a previous reviewer has said, there are too many great places to eat in this city without having to deal with this kind of pricey behaviour. Perhaps my mind will be changed when I eat the food -- but maybe even not, since I'm vegetarian: When I called to check about possible off-menu options (tons of places will rustle something up for you if you ask them nicely!), they said it would depend on what the chef had in that day; and when I responded that maybe I could call in on the day of or the day before, I was told (literally) "Oh, I wouldn't bother". Thanks, House. Thanks.

Went here twice this past weekend. Once for dinner and again the next day for lunch since they ran out of the Pork Chops that I wanted. The fact that we went back the second day is a testament to how good this restaurant is. First of all, make sure you have reservations for dinner. The place is TINY and always packed. There is nowhere to comfortably wait either so you'll be awkwardly standing over someone else eating or getting hit by the door. Otherwise you can always stand outside. Price: On a generic level, it's spendy for your typical Chinese meal, but this isn't typical and it's worth it. Atmosphere: The place is small and very intimate which can translate to being kind of loud but it's not bad. I love that it's not hoity toity. No flash, just good food. Dress: Casual. Jeans and a nice t-shirt will suffice. If you're self conscious, go with jeans and a polo and you'll be good. // GET IT: AHI TUNA TARTARE WITH ROASTED NORI CHIPS bursting with flavor and perfect combo of tender and crunchy. If you normally like tuna tartare this is a no brainier. Probably my favorite of the night. MUSHROOM RICE WITH GRILLED PRAWNS The rice is more like a risotto with an awesome truffle accent. Truffle fans will enjoy this. The prawns were good as well but the mushroom rice is the highlight in his dish. Never had anything like it. // IF THOSE TOP TWO THINGS AREN'T YOUR THING, GET THIS: GRILLED SEA BASS WITH GARLIC GINGER SOY the sea bass was grilled nicely and left the middle tender and buttery. My wife got this but I liked my mushroom rice more. We got the garlic noodles with it which were great and I wish there was more of it. I think you can get something else other than the garlic noodles. Maybe a salad but I'm not positive about that. // IF YOU'RE HUNGRY GET THIS TOO (they're good but otherwise, you're not missing out too much): WHITE SHRIMP AND CHINESE CHIVE DUMPLINGS were good but nothing crazy unique. You've probably had a dumpling like this before but sometimes you just want a dumpling and this will satisfy your craving. MAINE CRAB CAKE WITH PICKLED GINGER REMOULADE was fresh and quality crab meat. Crab cakes can get dense, too rich and heavy but these were fresh with light ingredients. The remoulade sauce was good as well. At the end of the day, nothing crazy. Needless to say, we'll be back. Look at that, i said it anyway!

I hate to pull the food snob card here, but I will. The food is just O.K. people! Either the other reviewers are folks who don't eat out much, or don't understand good food - all 2000 of them - or perhaps we hit this place on an OFF day. Honestly, the food was AVERAGE, what is everyone thinking?? The oysters were fine, just fine, the calamari, meh (far better at Vanessa's in Berkeley...with the best calamari EVER, ANYWHERE), the salad just alright, and the off-the-charts-rated-by-others-pork chop (drum roll please), not so great. So, I won't completely trash this place. The servers were very nice and, that, in itself, might warrant a return on a different day, with hopes that we will agree with the masses rather than diss them! Let's cross our fingers.

As a single girl, I sometimes think about what I'd like in a potential boyfriend. He should be nice, smart, funny, sweet, and arm candy material. ÊOh, and if he can make me wasabi noodles with grilled chicken just like how they make it at The House, I'm sold. Mike C. suggested meeting up here for lunch on a Friday, and I was torn between the three noodle dishes: udon noodle soup, curry noodles, or the warm wasabi noodles. ÊAfter asking the waitress what she thought, I went for the wasabi ones, but swapped out the pork for chicken instead. We split the fried salmon rolls, which is basically salmon wrapped in nori, deep-fried, and served with a spicy mustard sauce and a slaw on the side. ÊThe salmon was juicy and tender (and not by any means overcooked), and the seaweed skin was fried to a perfect crisp. ÊI only put on a thin strip of the mustard sauce (which was kind of runny), and it tasted great because it wasn't too hot, but gave it a great kick. The wasabi noodles had a very faint hint of wasabi (not very strong wasabi flavor if you're worried), but it was basically pan-fried noodles (like a yakisoba) with pieces of grilled chicken. ÊSo. Freaking. Good. ÊNot too greasy, no flavor was overpowering, everything just worked. For a lunch place, the prices are steeper than your usual sub-$10 salad or sandwich, but it's so worth it if you want to step out of the Financial District and onto a quieter corner of North Beach. Single guys, get your woks ready.

Thanks Dru C. ÊYou did not steer me wrong w/ your review about The House. ÊI'm so jelly of SF folk that you can dine here whenever you want. ÊI loved our dinner so much!

ÊI wouldn't recommend this place as an intimate & romantic place, but it's definitely a nice place to take someone on a date that you're comfortable with already. I ordered the Angus Ribeye steak.

ÊMy mouth is watering just thinking about this darn steak! My handsome date ordered a special that they were having, which was a scallop dish. ÊHe really enjoyed it too and finished every last piece.

Came here for date night with the boyfriend and we had a great time! We had reservations for 7PM and were seated right away. For starters, we ordered the deep-fried salmon roll with Chinese mustard. The rolls were garnished with a heaping amount of green caviar. Each salmon roll is wrapped with seaweed and then deep-fried. I loved the contrast of textures between the chewy salmon and crunchy exterior. Go easy with the Chinese mustard - it has a strong kick and definitely cleared up my sinuses Ê:D For entrees, my boyfriend and I decided to share the special - a halibut with clams in coconut curry and the infamous seabass with wasabi house noodles instead of the garlic noodles. I was blown away by the presentation! The seabass was AMAZING! The texture is so smooth, soft, and perfectly chewy. The seasoning was a touch too salty, but other than that it was perfect! The wasabi noodles were a little on the oily side and I didn't taste any wasabi in the noodles. The halibut and curry was good, but the seabass stole the show that night! We shared the coconut creme brulee for dessert which was good, but nothing amazing. I ordered the lychee iced tea which is unsweetened (but you can request for sugar on the side) - it had the perfect hint of lychee flavor - delicious! The ambiance of the restaurant is simple and cozy. The tables are crammed a little too close together. The table next to ours was clearly fit for two people maximum, but they still tried to cram three (big) people to one small table. The service was not bad, but felt rushed. The food came out so fast, as soon as we were done with our appetizers (literally 2 minutes later) they came out with the entrees. We were seated at 7PM and were finished with dinner by 7:45PM. Also, the restaurant is pretty loud, so the waitresses need to speak up! I could barely hear them when they were introducing the specials... Parking in North Beach area is hard to find, but we got really lucky and parked around Washington Square Park. Be prepared to spend a good 20 minutes circling for a spot or pay for parking in the garages. The food is creative, packed with lots of flavor, and beautifully presented. Prices are very reasonable as well. I definitely recommend checking out The House!!

Hands down the easiest restaurant to review - Every single dish ordered was delicious and left us wanting more! We were a group of 7 - had to wait for a table, but the waitress will give you a buzz Êon your cell phone a few minutes before your table is ready (how cool :))...so we walked over to Steps of Rome to get a drink. ÊI'd definitely recommend making reservations if you're heading over for dinner on a weekend....the restaurant isn't very big so space is limited - ambiance is cozy - good for both date nights and a night out with friends! We ordered all the Starter Specials our waitress mentioned (sorry none of this is on their menu): -Toro Nigiri - totally melts in your mouth -Grilled Octopus - the octopus was the perfect texture (not chewy) and I wanted to lick the plate cuz the sauce was to die for -Scallops - heavenly, I seriously could have had a plate of these succulent scallops all by myself - sux I had to share :P -Beef tartar - super interesting presentation - the tartar nestled on a perfectly crisp toast and a gorgeous radish, the taste matched the presentation. For our main courses: -I had the Halibut with clams (Special that night) - omg perfection on a plate - don't know how they incorporated okra in the dish, but yaaay for that! What others had and of course I had to sample a bite of every dish: -Sesame soy glazed salmon in a bonito sake broth: since I definitely plan on going back there - this will be the dish I order, the sake broth was flavorful and the salmon was done just right and they serve the salmon on a bed of greans which makes it a perfectly balanced meal... -Grilled ahi tuna with spicy mustard aioli - the best presentation ever - deserved all the oooooohs and aaaaahs cuz it was freaking tasty on top of that... -Niman ranch pork chop - the pork was so tender; it had this amazing caramalized glaze and was so good Desserts: Mango Tapioca - refreshing Chocolate cake with coffee icecream on the side - I was stuffed and still couldn't get enough of it :) We devoured all this with 2 bottles of their Nigori. Ê Overall - blown away and beyond satisfied! Worth every $$$ spent there! ***side note: Êthey allow the use of only 2 credit cards for a group...so carry cash if you're splitting the bill and don't want to run to the ATM.

Please take the Sea Bass off of your menu. And you need to do a better job of tasting the food before it leaves the kitchen, especially when it's being made before hand, referring to the mashed potatoes served with the rib eye. First off all, we were late to our dinner reservation and there were already three people ahead of us waiting for tables. But thankfully because we had reservations we were seated first before some others. BUT i had to go to the cashier and let the hostess know that i was late for me reservation and that we have arrived. BUT the hostess, had a rude attitude like "uh, ok." and looked at me with almost an annoyed look. oysters I recommend. the asparagus was served cold, and i do not think that was mentioned on the menu. they like to put SESAME SEEDS ON EVERYTHING! it's ok on a couple of signature dishes, but it can be overkill. the sea bass, don't get this. everything was super oily on that plate. the noodles and the green beans. oily doesn't mean seasoned. and the sea bass, i'm not sure it was fully fully cooked. it wasn't as flaky as i was expecting it to be, no real exciting reason to be savory. and the ginger soy sauce was so-so. not a date place, especially when you're so close and be a part of your neighbors conversation. parking sucks. the food arrived pretty fast. we didn't have dessert because we couldn't even hear ourselves think.

I think this is probably my favorite asian fusion restaurant. Came here last friday and the food was sooooooooooo good! the sea bass was cooked to perfection, the deep fried salmon roll was good, and the oysters were good especially with the sauce. Came here today again, sea bass, though good, did not compare to the one i had last friday. my guess is that the fish was overcooked. recommended my sister and bf to try their black cod special and concluded that the fish had gone bad. It had the texture of mashed potatoes and it was overly watery. The oysters and salmon roll are still good, but the tuna tartar is not that good imo. Based on today's experience, I would give this restaurant a 3 star, especially for the price, but since I love this restaurant so much, I just couldn't do it. Basically, I'm going to assume that weekends are when the ingredients are more fresh.

This place just radiates positive vibes as you walk in. So maybe we made reservations for 10 pm and didn't get seated till 1040...who cares. ÊIt was well worth it. The ambiance was warm and intimate in this small, nearly shack-like restaurant. That coupled with some fantastic food definitely redeemed every one of those 40 minutes I waited. Ê The roasted unagi with avocado rice stole the show. It was a meaty portion of eel with just a light coat of eel sauce. The rice was moist, brightened up by some avocado. ÊWe split the seabass for an entree which turned out to be the perfect complement to the unagi. It was light and fresh compared to the heavier tastes we started with. I totally recommend both fish! We also had a couple sidekicks like kobe beef tartare and shrimp and chives dumpling. It was hard to taste the beef in the tartare, cause it was heavily mixed with aioli. The crostini and apple gave it good texture but the flavors just weren't gelling all that well to me. And the dumplings were probably playing it safe- they turned out tasty but ordinary. They play the Asian fusion menu really well and while some of the apps were nothing special, the unagi and seabass were just amazing. If you're looking for sophisticated comfort, The House knows best.

Food is great, but the attitude of the servers is another story. Called to RSVP for a party of 6 and I felt the person on the line was annoyed that I was called. They request you to leave your credit card # in order to RSVP a spot. Apparently it's somewhat for their security in case you do not show Êup, they would charge your card for $10 per person unless you call in advance to cancel. I understand the restaurant is small and it hurts them if people do not show up. I'm sure they get it all the time so I wouldn't blame them for having such an attitude. Still, they should improve on their customer service.

I usually don't like sauce with my meat dishes but I always ask for more pomegranate sauce on the side with this pork chop dish, The blue lake bean tempura is always perfectly fried and the tempura batter is light and crispy, ÊOne time they had a special of the day appetizer which was just fresh hamachi and blue fin tuna, but it was so fresh and delicious. I saw the delivery guy from Royal Hawaiin deliver their seafood so they definitely are getting quality. I would say service is attentive and they are polite. ÊDefinitely love coming here for lunch.

The House doesn't really need another stellar review, but what the heck, the food is that great! ÊTheir pork chop is heavenly, and they sure know how to grill their fish. Seasonings are excellent, and often contain a very welcome element of surprise. The wine list is quite good. The staff super friendly, although they have to work in extremely narrow quarters. It doesn't get too loud, so you can actually carry a conversation. ÊReservations recommended!

With 1800 near-perfect reviews - you can't go wrong. ÊI am pretty sure that restaurants like this one in SF is the reason why Yelp was started. This place doesn't look like anything special. ÊBut let me just say that as a Yelp Elite for the past two years and having eaten more than my fair share of awesome meals in my 43 years (so far) on This Planet, I ate one of the best meals (top 10) I have ever eaten. It is not big, maybe 15 tables with seating for 40 people. ÊThe wait started at 7pm when we walked by on our way to a bar up the street. ÊThere are going to be people who write bad reviews about this place based on the fact that seating is somewhat chaotic. ÊOur group of 6 walked in and were seated before a couple who were waiting before us. ÊThis would be understandable except we sat a 4-top with two extra seats on the ends and any other restaurant would have seated a couple at it. We started with an appetizer of unagi over wasabi rice - Incredible! ÊAnd albacore (tuna) tartar that was the best sushi-grade I have ever tasted. I had the Sea Bass - the combination of fish, SAUCE on the side, rice noodles and green beans was awesome. ÊOne of the specials was prawns on a mushroom risotto. The steak on noodles was equally good. Did I mention the amazing service!? Nothing was bad about the meal. ÊI took five of my co-workers here and every one of them thought it was equally as good. ÊI think I may get a promotion out of it!

I have no qualms with the food...it was excellent. In fact, I didn't find it particularly overpriced either, it seemed fair based on the high quality ingredients and presentation. It's the service and the general feel of the place that was a let down. Nothing wrong with the ambiance, but the place was always a bit overcrowded. Also, the host was rather inconsiderate and told us the wait was 30 minutes when it was nearly 1 hour, without giving us an update unless we asked. Also, our server was very cold and impersonal, just placing the food on the table and leaving. For future reference, a reservation online is a must. Second, you must try the Pork Chop, it has the most incredible pomegranate glaze! The salmon roll was a tasty appetizer, and the Kobe Salad special was light and flavorful. Lastly, the dessert was a chocolate "cream pie" though it was basically just a mousse...very decadent nonetheless. Again, no problems with the food, only with the people involved.

We arrived at 6pm and got a table for 3 straight. we were delighted as previously we had arrived at 8pm and there was a wait for 1.5hr. So either come early or book as this a popular place and for good reason. ÊThe food is awesome. ÊI had the special which was kobe beef with garlic potatoes and cauliflower with mushroom toppings. ÊDelicious. My wife really enjoyed her salmon and sister in law only had a mushroom soup which wasn't even on the menu but they happily provided. ÊAll the portents we nicely sized but would not be considered large Right after we decided we were definitely coming back. ÊThe only thing to note is the price. ÊIt is not cheap especially the wine but we were all in agreement that it was worth it. Oh yeah and a big tip is to have the creme broulee for dessert. ÊI wanted to lick the bowl.

Date night with the significant other... the occasion? payday of course! Came here because it was recommended by kat c., a fellow foodie who lives in SF, and I wanted to explore the food in SF more since I've exhausted the restaurants in the East Bay. TIP: Called in and got Reservations for 8pm, but was told if I tried to come earlier they would try to accommodate me. Came at 6pm and was seated almost immediately! We order the Salmon Rolls for appetizer, split both the Sea Bass and Kobe Beef for entree, and had Fresh Peaches and Vanilla ice cream for dessert. The Salmon Rolls were SOOOOOO good. It's a must try! I could eat 10 more orders of those. I'm salivating just thinking about it... The Sea Bass is so good, buttery, and melts in your mouth. The S.O. doesn't generally like fish, but thought it was really good as well. The Kobe Beef was a special, it was a perfect medium rare. Soft and delicate, but with full flavor. You can taste the quality in it! The dessert was alright, but it was the perfect way to end the meal. I got the Lychee Black Tea to drink with my meal, but I should have just gotten wine. It was mediocre. Despite the fact that the Tea and the dessert doesn't deserve a 5 star rating, all the other elements really gives those stars back! I can't wait to come back here!

They are unafraid of separating you from your dead presidents at The House, but these are happy transactions: we ambled in here with a group of twelve, keen on sharing family-style goodies of the Asian Fusion and New American persuasions, and though The House is aptly characterized as boutique sized, they made plenty of room for our hearty party and kept the good bites coming. Highlights included a light and tasty sea bass, delectable Kobe beef, Ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips, asparagus with roasted sesame dressing for some of our veggie diners, steamed mussels with garlic infused shrimp broth, and creative craft brews and summery wines on the flow. Fortunately, we managed to stick the landing with a creme brulee (featuring sea salt, a fair juxtaposition for creme brulee's typical exploits). In all, The House was a warm and delicious way to spend an evening. Frankly, that we found food as good as the company within said something to me. And that's enough to extend smiles beyond a transcendent meal itself.

Food.. Absolutely terrific. Off the charts for me. It's Chinese-American Fusion like my parents used to make sorta =), but well, add in a few decades of culinary evolution, and you'll have what they have here. ÊThe food is very consistent in quality over the YEARS that I've been coming here. Service: Great this time! (more details below..) My wife and I usually try to avoid North Beach on the weekends, but since we had a special occasion to celebrate, we braved the partying crowds of Halloween and the nearly impossible parking situation to make it to our restaurant of choice for the evening - The House. Once there, we had to wriggle our way in through the door to get our names on the waiting list. ÊYes, it helps to have reservations, but after about 35-45 minutes of standing near the door, enjoying the scene and studying the menu by the window, we earned our table. ÊSo you CAN do it without reservations, but ya just have to wait a little. For appetizers, I ordered the Mixed green salad with Avocados, Apple and with White Shrimp Tempura. ÊIt was delivered without delay.. only about five or six minutes after ordering. I rarely say "WOW.. that was good" involuntarily about any appetizer, but here.. I did! ÊIt's THAT good. My wife ordered one of the specials for the week - a hothouse Tomato Soup served with a fried clam on top of a small dollop of mashed potatoes. ÊNo disappointment here. Soup was light, and the fried clam seem to have been fried in their same batter as their calamari. ÊIt was a delectable beginning to a terrific dinner. I had been pining for a decent steak over the last week or so, and while The House is probably known best for it's seafood and pork entrees, I ordered the Angus Rib-Eye in a garlic-butter sauce as my main course. ÊThis red meat offering is usually served over a bed of mashed potatoes with Chinese Mustard Greens. ÊAs for my preferences, I had them substitute rice instead of the mash, which they were glad to do. ÊThe entree arrived medium-well just as I had hoped, seared and caramelized beautifully both aromatically and visually. ÊYUM! ÊEach careful bite was incredible and savored with much care. Service? ÊHmm. this time, it was actually pretty friendly for once. Our waitress was attentive, not obtrusive, and water service was right-on. No waiting, no issues with "throwing menus" in front of the customer. Much better than my prior visit back in 2009. After this latest visit, I am happy to reinstate "The House" to my list of all-time favorite places to enjoy a high quality meal.

I can't believe I haven't tried this place before! ÊI came here for a date not too long ago and was blown away by the food quality. ÊWhen we arrived, I was a bit bummed that they had already given away our table after a short ten minute delay. ÊI'm glad we decided to wait, because the food was to die for. ÊWe had four dishes in total. Ê Caesar Sald with Crispy Scallops: ÊA Their caesar dressing is really something else. ÊIt has a nice tart flavor to it, and isn't too creamy. ÊThe scallops are fried, and were a nice golden brown served right out of the frier. ÊThey just melted in your mouth with a rich seafood flavor. Deep-fried chicken liver with baby greens: ÊA I thought the crispy scallop salad was good, but this was another level. ÊThe chicken liver was fried as well, and had the perfect consistency and richness with every bite. ÊIt was tossed in a vinagrette dressing that really let the creaminess of the chicken liver shine. Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak: ÊA Cooked to a perfect medium rare, the flatiron had the perfect texture. ÊFlatiron is not known to be a soft cut of beef, but is instead known for its very beefy flavor. ÊEven though it was a little rough, it exceeded my expectations for a flatiron. ÊThe wasabi noodles were simply delicious. ÊThey were udon style and pan fried with a wasabi sauce. Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy: ÊA+ The sea bass was grilled and was also served over a bed of noodles in a sweet soy sauce. ÊThe sea bass was cooked perfectly, and juices melted out of it when I first cut it. ÊIt was right at the point where it was almost rare, so it was not dry at all. ÊI was very impressed that it wasn't mushy, but actually had some give to the texture. Overall, a great place. ÊI can see why this place was so full even on a weeknight. ÊPlease come try this place! ÊI will continue recommending it to my friends. ÊThey don't have to many covers, so be sure to make reservations. PROTIP: ÊThey have a great wine list that can easily be paired with many menu items.

Tiny place that can accommodate large parties. Gotta love that. The staff are real pros who are not only efficient in serving our party of twelve family-style helpings of Asian goodness but who were also very helpful with respecting my vegan diet amongst a sea of carnivores. Bravo! I am smitten with the tasty asparagus that had the best sesame dressing that I have tasted in a long time! They also whipped up the warm wasabi house noodles entree with tofu in lieu of angus flatiron steak as shown on the menu. Yum in the tum! The wine list had a nice roster of varietals that paired wonderfully with the menu. I must point out that my glass was never allowed to be empty as the staff were ready to top it off at all times. Yes, my heart is bursting with mad love right about now! I would definitely have another feast here when I am in San Fran again.

Double-ply toilet paper? You have my attention, House. And my being impressed didn't stop there. Our team of 10 did a family-style meal, so I had the opportunity to try (hog?) lots of tapas and entrees. The tiny venue could be intimate -- or could be incredibly loud ... when you have a big, rowdy group like ours! But the careful presentation and solid wine list make it a place that would be appropriate for a date. Highlights of the evening for me: the tuna app, rare sliced steak, and kobe steak. Everyone swears by the sea bass. But that was more like 4 stars for me. Overall, it's Asian Fusion at its best -- a great mix of influences, strong flavor, and some spice. Of the desserts, the fudge-y chocolate cake was amazing (when is chocolate not?). The blueberry cheesecake was a bit tart for my taste. The creme brulee had some salt topping it, which added a nice dimension to the dessert.

This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in the city. I lived in Asia for 15 years, so I know a thing or two about good Asian food. PROS - Sea bass - beautiful beautiful dish Ahi tuna - best ahi tuna tartare i've ever had Crab/shrimp tempura - this is a freshly cooked tempura placed into a nice salad. delightful wasabi house noodles with flatiron steak Nice ambience Good proximity to a lot of nice after dinners spots (hello Naia gelato!) CONS - -This is an incredibly popular restaurant so make a reservation as early as possible. If you call the day of, you will probably not get a seat. If you walk in any time between 6-9pm you will probably not get seated. Hands down one of my favorite restaurants here. In theory, it is very similar to Slanted Door but with better food, better value, and less pretentiousness.

This place was sitting in my "to try" list for such a long time, and when my date asked which restaurant I want to try, I just jumped on the opportunity. Finally! Maybe it's because I had such a great expectation to this place (but with 1900+ reviews with 4.5 stars, how could you not have high expectations?), but at least to me, this place turned out to be a bit of disappointment. The service was okay. Nothing outstanding, but it's not like we were ignored or anything. Although we had a reservation, we still had to wait for about 20 minutes, which was still acceptable. [ Appetizer ] Scallops: Great. Sauce was amazing and scallops were very well cooked with full of flavors. Lobster Tempura Salad: Tempura was not at all greasy, so it worked really well with the salad. Again, the dressing was amazing. [ EntrŽe ] Seabass: Of course, I had to try their famous seabass. Yes, the fish itself was excellent - no argument about that part. But the ginger soy sauce was way too salty and too strong. From the moment I tasted the sauce, I knew it could ruin the whole dish. The sauce was completely unnecessary. And then, it came with this sad looking noodle, which I couldn't even figure out what it was. It almost tasted like Japanese Yaki Udon, but the texture was way too soft (it did have a nice flavor, though). Angus Flatiron Steak: The steak was cooked very nicely. It was tender and juicy. But what is wrong with the noodle?? It was again very soft and too spicy. The spiciness was definitely from the chili and not from wasabi. I tried the noodle and it was so spicy that I couldn't even have a second bite. And again, where is wasabi?? [ Dessert ] Crme brulee with passion fruit sauce: Nothing outstanding. Very mediocre = disappointing. The bill came out about $90 for two, which I think it's relatively affordable. I just don't really understand why this place gets such great reviews. Did we just order wrong dishes? Don't get me wrong, I actually like Asian Fusion Cuisines, but I've been places that can execute the dishes better. The House has such great potential and they do some dishes really well, but I really felt they're just not able to perfect the entire meal. In other words, there was always something wrong in a dish, which is disappointing because they did their appetizers so well.

We walked in at ~6:30pm without a reservation and were seated in a matter of minutes - spare table in the back in the midst of a full house, YAY! The House really is a pleasant little surprise; located in an area full of late night drunk food and strip clubs, The House sits idly. Its a very small restaurant (like all SF restaurants), and has very limited seating - they suggest you make a reservation a month in advance in order to avoid waiting, but thankfully we got there at the time that we did since a line did start to form once we were seated. The House's specialty is seafood, with an Asian Fusion flair. The menu at The House seems to change every now and then in order to fit whats in season, but also with 4-5 daily specials and a few staples (i.e. wasabi noodles, sea bass, kurobuta pork chop, etc.). Going off suggestions from Yelp reviews, we went with their specials and their tried and true wasabi noodles. Special Appetizer; Scallops w/ micro greens (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) I have never been a huge fan of scallops, with the exception of in my sushi... but my boyfriend loves them so we went for their crispy scallop special that night. OH.EM.GEE. these were the best scallops I've ever had - and the dish definitely became my favorite of the night! The scallops were cooked perfectly - not a hint of rubberiness, just perfect/delicate break-with-your-fork butteriness. They sat in a pool of this most devine heart-clenching sauce, with a small mound of micro-greens to cut the butteriness... each bite was surreal. If you happen to be at The House when this is on the menu - GET IT; you'll thank me later... 5 stars. Special Appetizer; Big Eye Tuna sashimi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) It was difficult to navigate our way through this dish, but it was enjoyable - hard to compete with coming after the scallops though... 3.5 stars. Special Request; Seasonal Fish (Mahi Mahi) w/ Wasabi Noodles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) YESSSSS, they take special requests! I don't remember how they said they were serving their seasonal fish that night, but it wasn't with their wasabi noodles... so we kindly asked if they would make it like so, and they said yes - yay! The mahi mahi was cooked perfectly, and topped with a nice and tangy salad of pickled onions - which I wish there was more of - Êhelped to cut the butteriness of the dish. The noodles (udon style) were the perfect thickness and cooked just right, though the taste of wasabi was not very prevalent - A-OK with me, since I'm too weak-sauce for strong wasabi taste anyway, but it did make the noodles less impression-lasting. They also gave us some of their ginger soy sauce (which typically comes with their sea bass w/ wasabi noodles dish) on the side, even though it was totally unneeded since the dish was already perfectly seasoned/sauced. Overall a great LARGE dish, perfect to share between 2-3 people, though nothing extraordinary that I felt I couldn't find anywhere else... 4 stars. I am typically wary of Asian Fusion, but this was overall a great experience with exceptionally prepared food and caring/accommodating service. Prices are reasonable for the size and quality, plus atmosphere is dim and easy going - perfect for dates or just nights out. I can't wait to come back - I really want to try their deep-fried chicken liver salad and their lunch menu, unagi avocado sandwich :D

Admittedly, the food is good. Not the regular "eh"-good, it was "oooh aah"-good. But other aspects of my experience left much to be desired. We came on father's day, made a reservation ( was warned that you must arrive on time ) and was promptly seated. The main head of the House, some lady that stands near the cash register and just answers phone calls, has a permanent grimace on her face. I hope she smiles a bit more for her sake. Q: how many people can you fit in a sardine can? A: 23 people! The House is not a house, it's a 400 sq ft dorm room. My family of 5 was squished in a tiny corner, with barely any elbow room to pick up a spoon. We were given an itsy bitsy amount of pickled cucumber as an appetizer, which my father enjoyed. He asked for another small dish of the cucumber, since one is not enough for five people. AND shockingly, he was flat-out denied...ON FATHER'S DAY. The waitress snootily stated that an additional plate was $3...I was in a incredulous coma. Pickled cucumber...are you kidding me? every asian restaurant gives dollops of this for free. I guess $$$ means super stingy as well. If the following dishes of mushroom rice, grilled sea bass, salad and stir-fried udon noodles were not as amazing as they were, I would have seethed and spitted venom. I think this is one of those once in a lifetime dining experiences.

when a restaurant averages 4.5 out of 5 stars while being reviewed over 2,000 times, you know you are in for a treat. Êlocated near chinatown in san francisco, the restaurant certainly lived up to its reputation. although its considered asian fusion, its a lot less asian than i expected.

I love this place. We came here for our five years anniversary. I have read about this place but never really came around to it. Parking was hard to find but lucky after making four circles around the block, I saw someone leaving across the street. Scored! I recommend making reservation because the place is small and it can fill up quick. The food was amazing. We started off with the fried salami roll which was perfect but the sauce was a bit spicy for me. My bf had the kobe special and it was delicious. The meat just melt into your mouth and you can't help taking another bite. I had the wasabi noodle with flat iron steak. It was good but the steak was a little rough. I would definitely come back.

Even when we say we aren't going to have them, a table nearby will be eating them and we immediately fold and place an order. Because the restaurant is small and the tables are close together, everyone ends up carrying on conversations with their neighbors. The last time we ate here we sat next to a young couple on their honeymoon from Georgia. ÊThe bride told me that she did hours of research before their trip and discovered that The House was one of the most recommended restaurants in San Francisco (quite the accomplishment for a city with such great restaurants). She said it was the best salmon that she had ever had and couldn't figure out why - it was like magic. ÊIndeed.

Crab cakes - this place knows how to dish up some bomb crab cakes. There's some tobiko in there and every bite just pops in your mouth. Scallops- 5 stars! If only the scallops were a little bigger Heheheh Fish w/ noodles-two words "GYM TOMORROW" Ok...and as for the last dish.... Salmon w/ miso broth- the fish was good, but I wish they didn't put too much broth on the dish to the point it looks like the fish was swimming in it. Other than that, This place is off the house!! Prices are fair for the portion. Geez....You guys truly woo'ed me in with your service and beautiful presentation on your awesome FOOD.

Asian fusion in the a gorgeous and delicious form. We had a huge party of people and this small, intimate location accommodated us. The wine was flowing, delicious Riesling, and the glorious, tasty food was getting passed around. ÊWe went ahead and ordered various plates and just shared. Ê The staff gets huge props for dealing with a large group and keeping our glasses full and taking various orders and being so lovely about it. The most memorable dish, the flaky, deliciously, light Sea Bass. WOW! It literally melted in my mouth and the teriyaki type sauce was a perfect match. The green beans and mashed potatoes were a great addition. The scallops were glorious in all their flavor and texture. The shrimp and orzo pasta dish, I literally wanted to lick the bowl clean, it was so savory. The desserts, WOW! I was so full from all the amazing dishes that I didn't think I had room until I laid eyes on the flan and chocolate deliciousness that was placed in front of me. Do NOT skip dessert! Save room!

Came there again for dinner on a Wednesday. Our reservation was 6:30pm and we were seated right the way. The waitress was so friendly and helpful. We ordered: Grilled ahi tuna (rare) with spicy mustard aioli (5/5) - It was delicious! The presentation of the dish was nice and the tuna was fresh. I really like the sushi rice on the side. Very good combination. Pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce (5/5) - Again, it was so good. The pork chop was so tender and juicy. The sauce was flavorful but not too heavy. The portion was good too. Can't wait to go back to try other stuffs beside pork chop!

Make reservations! Don't say I didn't warn ya. Came here with friends right when they opened at 5:30pm on a Thursday evening. Seriously, we got there right on the dot and thank goodness because when we said we had no reservations (party of 3), staff said hold on while we check if we can squeeze you in. Well, they found a small table for us that was meant only for a party of 2, but they added a 3rd chair. I didn't mind because we didn't make reservations after all. Okay, so now the food. We ordered 3 appetizers and 1 main dish to share. Everything was yummy. Seriously, everything! - Deep-fried salmon roll with Chinese hot mustard. 5* I think this one was my favorite. I definitely want to order it again if I return here. - White shrimp and Chinese chive dumplings. 4* This was also good. - the third appetizer was one of their specials for the night. It was a scallop dish. So yummy. 5* - Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak 5* I don't care so much for the noodles, although it was good as well, but I was mostly impressed with how perfect the steak was. We ordered it medium rare and it was just perfect. My friends, who had gone to an expensive steakhouse the previous night, said that this steak was so much better. This place is very, very tiny. You might get lucky and be seated right away without a reservation, but I highly recommend calling for a reservation. It only has one restroom (unisex) but it was clean.

I don't what it is, but I REALLY like this place. ÊPossible reasons: 1. I went here with a friend who I normally eat at 3 star places with. ÊHe chose the restaurant, so I was expecting something 3 stars. ÊLow expectations = easy to blow away my expectations? 2. Really cute, sleek wood interior. ÊSmall space. ÊFeels cozy like a home. 3. ÊEach placemat on the table has a tiny house stamp!! ÊLike a little house is cut into your placemat. ÊI thought it was really cute. Ê Ok, onto the more substantive stuff. ÊWe ordered the specials of the day for nearly everything. ÊThe day we went the appetizer special was seared scallops. ÊWOW! ÊReally divine scallops. ÊI don't even know how they cooked them, but they were better than the scallops I had at Spruce ( imagine that!). ÊWhen the first bite exceeded what I had tasted at Spruce, I knew that I was in for something spectacular. ÊAt times like this I wish I had gone to culinary school so that I could describe the food better....but I didn't so I can't. ÊThe scallops were amazing though. Ê For the entree, we ordered the 1) Grilled ahi tuna with spicy mustard aioli and 2) Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. Ê Both dishes get an A+ for presentation. Ê I am terrible with spicy food, so I was a bit nervous about the ahi....it would've been awful if it was too spicy for me to enjoy. ÊBut, the ahi wasn't spicy at all - it just had a lovely mustard aioli flavor to it. ÊThe ahi was served with white rice and some leafy greens (maybe bak choy?) that had been stirred in the fry pan. ÊThe leaves were a bit too salty for my taste, but complimented the ahi nicely since the ahi did not have a lot of flavor on its own. ÊThe ahi quality was excellent. Ê The sea bass just melts in your mouth. ÊIt is served with thick noodles and some greens. ÊThe fish comes with a good garlic gingery dipping sauce....the sauce was great. ÊI found myself even dipping the ahi in it. Ê For dessert, we got the special of the day. ÊPeach and nectarine pie with vanilla icecream. ÊHoly $jsfs. ÊMove over Marie Callendars! ÊThe pie was served warm....perfect crust thickness, fresh peaches and nectarines, perfect sweetness. Ê I was blown away the whole meal. ÊI really liked that the ambiance wasn't over-the-top fancy (I hate over-the-top fancy), but yet the quality was still very high. Ê The restaurant itself is small so I can imagine that there's a huge line on the weekends. ÊHighly recommend!

The house, this review saddens me because I would've given it 5 stars the times before when I was there. I've been here for 4 times before and the taste and presentation is out of the ball park, but this time, I went with my boyfriend hoping to impress, The House disappointed me. We had the tuna tartare and it was a little watery, maybe the chef didn't dry off all the water that was with the fish when they were washing it, but I never tasted their tartare to be so bad. We got the NY steak and the pork chop. NY steak was slice in a triangular way where one side was thinner than the other, The thicker side of the steak was great but not so much the dry thin layer. C'mon, shouldn't they know what a good steak is about even though it's Asian Fusion?!? The pork chop didn't disappoint since it's always the signature thing they have. IT was a little overcook from what I remember from the last time I had it but nonetheless, still very juicy in the center. The one star knock off was... We were there at 6 knowing it'll be jammed pack any later... The waitress told us that we can sit but they need the table back in an hour. I'm thought it was rude for them to tell us that but I guess better informing us before than trying to give bad customer service like we're being rush. From what I just read on the side, the waitress does always seem stress. C'mon, I believed she worked there for a while and she's always just stressed out. It's kinda crazy. This review is only for the experience I had last night. I still would rave about it.

Came in after seeing glowing reviews on Yelp. ÊDefinitely did not live up to the 5 star reviews. ÊI don't think there is 3 star Michelin restaurant in the world with more 5 star reviews than The House, which seems is a little fishy to me. ÊHere is review of what we ordered: Salmon Rolls: Salmon wrapped around sea weed then deep fried. ÊSuper hot mustard dipping sauce. ÊWasn't very good. Ê Wasabi noodles with steak: Steak was cooked properly but was chewy and flavorless, which tells me they use low quality meat. ÊNoodles were soggy and too salty. Halibut (special): Was fine, nothing special. ÊA little under seasoned but was fine otherwise. Overall the food was just OK. Again, nothing special. ÊI would give this place 3 stars, but had to take one star away after factoring in the price ($100 for two people) Ê The House does have a great vibe and a good wine list. ÊI will not be coming back.

I went here for the first time with my friend Sam because he is on a mission to try to replicate the "Wasabi Noodles" here. Its a very small venue. You are so close to your neighbors you might accidently fork their plate. If you are going to come try this place out definitely make reservations or you will be like us and have to togo it and eat in your car. I had the white shrimp, avocado with green dish. There is nothing fancy or makes it stand out that I would have this dish again. It was seriously greens in a light vinaigrette and some deep friend shrimps on top of paper thin slices of apples and avocado with a mystery white sauce (not very typical in an Asian dish). I think that is what cause me to make my own sauce later. My friend Sam got the Wasabi Noodle dish with chicken...maybe because it was in a brown togo box that made not want to try it but I did. It was quite good and made me wish I got the same dish. I think it is the Asian in me but I don't like fancy Asian "Fusion" joints. If I am going to get some Korean Ribs or a Fancy Salad I would hit up an all you can eat Korean BBQ joint or Plutos.That's just me...if you have a few extra dollars to throw out there for French size portions this place is for you.

SEA BASS. SEA BASS. SEA BASS. It was the softest, juiciest, and most tender piece of fish I've ever had. I thought the sesame soy ginger sauce & green beans complemented the fish very well. Every bite of fish melted in your mouth. This place deserves 10 stars. Only gripe I had was parking. It took us a while to find street parking but it was so worth it in the end. Please go here and get the sea bass!!!!! It will change your life. Really ;)

Probably one of the best Asian Fusions I've EVER had. I was treated out to this lovely restaurant for our 7 year anniversary at this small "house" but hoppin' place! We had reservations for 7pm and called to informed them that we would be a few minutes late. They told us they were only going to hold it for ten minutes max. I'm glad they kept their word unlike many restaurants that give it away regardless and you would still have to wait! We were seated right away, by the window. Best seat in my opinion! And quickly read our specials of the day. We ordered: 1) Soft shell crab with spicy soba noodles (their special of the night) 2) Ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips 3) Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak (my bf swapped for NY steak, DEFINITE MUST!) 4) Angus ribeye steak, housemade teriyaki, toasted garlic butter 1) Crab was a-ok, however presentation was nice. Spicy soba noodles had a nice balance of sweet/spicy. 2) MMM, ahi tuna was fresh and tangy! The chips add a nice crunch to the tender fish. 3) The NY steak just melts in your mouth, the noodles had a strong but not overpowering wasabi taste. 4) MAN, I LOVED my Angus ribeye steak. I proudly devoured it! Tender, perfect medium rare, topped with crispy basil and garlic. The mash potatoes were such a delight. It was also nicely paired with the gai-lan veggie. I think one of the reasons that THE HOUSE is so successful is that they have both nice textures and a WOW factor in their flavors. Many restaurants lack one or the other, at times both. PLUS, their portions & prices are awesome! Cheers to The HOUSE! You guys just raised the bar for Asian Fusion!

The noodles were incredibly soft, so were the scallops. It's a good kind of soft, like melt in your mouth-type soft. The toppings on the scallops were crunchy and the beans were cooked properly. I remember the noodles being incredibly salty. The highlight of the meal was the scallops. They were very very good. It was crazy soft and melted in my mouth. I know I keep repeating the same thing, but you must understand how crazy soft it was. It's like I didn't even need teeth. The sea bass was fresh and was seasoned properly. It was good. Overall, I enjoyed my food but it's so crazy expensive I probably won't be back in a LONG time. We paid 80 for two people. We're poor college students, so we'll come back if we win the lottery. Four stars for the meal, minus one for being so expensive.

Love. Love. LOVE ! Everything was phenomenal ! The wine, the appetizers, the entrees, the service -- it was all exceptional. We ordered a special they had as one of our appetizers. It was a grilled calamari with something on top that made the dish look like it was movinggg ! It was a pretty exciting experience ! You must try it. Plus, the dish was full of smokey goodness ! The other starter we got was the deep fried salmon. GET IT. End of story. For my main dish, I got the Wasabi Noodles with a Flatiron Steak, cooked medium-rare. The noodles were just the right texture and flavor, and the steak was cooked to perfection ! No condiments necessary because everything was seasoned so well. The bf's entree was the Rib-eye steak cooked medium rare. It was total M&M's status. The steak literally melted in your mouth ! SO yummy. The portions were also gigantic. We could have shared and topped it off with dessert at the end, but of course we didn't think things through until it was too late. Oh well. We'll be back, we promise ! We're determined to try every plate at least once. (:

How is it that I didn't know about The House? Geez. I haven't been Yelping for a while and almost 2000 people go and upstage me by having come here first. Had a friend visiting from out of town on business and my fav foodie guy picks this place as one of the places he's been dying to try. Arriving a bit early, we waited in the doorway taking photos of the restaurant while waiting for our friends staying in SF to join. After ordering a bottle of wine to start, we perused the menu and decided to order 3 out of the 4 specials of the day. One was a hamachi plate with tobiko and avocado, served on a bed of large cucumbers. Delicious. Following that we had a mixed greens salad with figs, grapes and a light dressing. This was good, but I can't remember what else was in it, so it mustn't have been that spectacular. Then we had a fried soft shell crab. The flavors here were delicious. It maintained it's juiciness and texture, while being easy to eat and cut. Finally we ordered the scallops which were the jumbo sized, and they had 3 to share. Tender and cooked to a perfect consistency, this was a great way to end the appetizers. For dinner I forgot what everyone else ordered, but I had ordered the sea bass. The fish was really well cooked, but I have to say whatever sauce they served it with was way overpowering. I generally like my sea bass served with a light broth so that you can really tasted the fish. This sauce was completely overpowering, but I am lucky that they already pair it as a side dish, instead of drizzling it all over the fish. Fantastic dinner for a weeknight in the city. I'm glad Chiawen was visiting so that we could take a break on a weeknight for great conversations and fine dining over wine with whine.

The House is a tiny restaurant in the Italian District specializing in Asian Fusion cuisine. ÊIt has a great ambiance but is very small (and always crowded) so make sure you book a table ahead of time! ÊThe tables are situated close together but we had a great time getting to know our neighbors at the table next to us when we went (I blame the wine!). When I went there with my husband and friends, we ordered the grilled octopus and the Deep-Fried Salmon Roll with Chinese Hot Mustard for the table. ÊMy husband was in love with this dish - It had just the right amount of spice! For my entree I ordered the Angus Ribeye Steak with Housemade Teriyaki and Toasted Garlic Butter. ÊIt was soooo good.

We went at 6:15 p.m. on a Thursday. We picked this restaurant because we live down the street and haven't tried it yet. I read on yelp that it was asian fusion and we don't visit asian fusion restaurants often. My boyfriend was also craving sushi, so why not? We called to see how busy it was and and had to make reservations. The place is small. There were a couple groups eating when we arrived. We were seated pretty quickly at a two person table in between a group and a couple with a child. The seating arrangement next to us had the 3rd person sitting with the back almost touching our table. It gets a little loud in the restaurant. The restaurant was put together well though, very neat and simple. My boyfriend commented on how they had their picture frames sunken into the wall. We had service immediately, and were told the specials of the day. We tried Seared Scallops for a small plate. It was one special of the day. It was good, and sweet. Then we had Deep Fried Salmon rolls. These were delicious like other yelpers have said. I could eat these everyday! ( Although, that might not be very healthy) And raw oysters. It came with a cilantro mignonette sauce, which I didn't think was very special compared to any other mignonette on oysters. I had the grilled ahi tuna for my main dish, and my boyfriend had the kobe steak with mashed potatoes and mushrooms, which was another special of the day. Both of our meals were delicious and we ate them all up! Both were nice and rare. And everything was presented very beautifully. We also had some sake to drink, with demon in the name. I can't remember the exact name of it, but it was very light and easy to drink. People say that this place is expensive but for just two people, I thought it was fine. We pay that much for most restaurants in SF. And sometimes much more than what we paid!

Food here is just OK...not great, not bad...just ok. ÊNot sure why it has such rave reviews. ÊPresentation of food is nice though..too bad it's not as tasty as it looks. Shared the following 3 appetizers & 1 main course: Roasted unagi (eel) with avocado sushi rice(3.5 stars): Typical sushi you can get at any restaurant. ÊI liked how the bonito flakes are "moving" on top when they bring it out to you. Ê"Safe" dish b/c it's very typical. Deep-fried salmon roll (2 stars): ÊDid not particularly like this one..maybe wasn't a fan of the cooked salmon (bit dry)? ÊWasn't bad...but wasn't good either. ÊSkip this dish. Softshell Crab (3 stars): Also very typical. ÊGood, but nothing special. ÊAlso served with small portion of noodles. ÊNice presentation though...there are these fried "wonton-stick" things that stick out of the crab that give it a tree-like look. Ê Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy (4 stars): ÊBest thing I ate out of the 4 dishes. ÊGood BUT it still isn't anything to rave about. ÊSea bass was nice & buttery, and I liked the green beans that came with it. ÊIt is also served w/ Udon noodles I believe. It's already well seasoned & salty enough, so even though they give you extra sauce on the side, you won't be needing it.

Apps were the softshell crab, fried salmon rolls and ahi tuna- 4 stars Entrees were the seas bass and cod - 4 stars Dessert was coconut creme brulee with passionfruit sauce - 3 stars Overall the food was solid (4 stars). the food/food quality itself is as good as some of the better chinese/japanese restaurants i've been to, but it didn't exceed them. Like, i've had as good tuna tartare and even better softshell crab at good japanese restaurants; i've had as good of garlic noodles as chinese restaurants, etc. The cod an bass were exceptional, but i've had as good of bass at Katsuya in LA and prime 112 in Miami, but it's up there with the top 3. I think what really set this place apart is the presentation (as you can see), but then it almost sets a higher expectation for how good the food should taste. You're almost primed to think that the food should be better than what it is (even though it's already GOOD), and then you find that the food is not as great as the presentation makes you think it should be - does that make sense? Anyway i'd definitely recommend people try it out; i kind of like the casual/hole-in-the-wall atmosphere cuz then the food takes you by surprise, but it's not necc a restaurant I would keep going back to since only the presentation is truly unique, not the food.

I've been coming to The House on a regular basis for the past couple years for both lunch and dinner. ÊDuring my recent lunch outing, I could not believe how bad the service had gotten!! Ê There were only a few occupied tables. ÊThere was no greeting by the 2 waitresses. ÊWe were glared at and then seated. ÊI understand the House usually takes reservations over walk ins, but does that mean you serve us lunch with your nasty attitude. ÊIt took us 20 minutes to get the waitress' attention. ÊWhen she finally came over, I politely asked her what the specials were and she replied, "Oh, I thought you were ready to order!" Ê I was completely stunned. ÊAm I not paying for this meal?! I was actually quite ready to walk, but since we were on our lunch hour, we went ahead and put in our orders. Ê The food was okay. ÊDefinitely not as amazing as it used to be. ÊAs the lunch hour wore on, I noticed there were still quite a few empty tables. Ê Throughout our meal, I saw the waitress 2 times - put our down in (we waved her down) and for the check (we waved her down) There's nothing I dislike more than terrible service. ÊIt doesn't matter how delish your food is if your service stinks! I'll really have to reconsider going back. ÊMaybe if they bring back the male servers with the pleasant attitude.

One word: AMAZING!!! Everything from the presentation of the food to the quantities to the taste was impressive. I went with a group of friends; we were 6 altogether. So we got to sample quite a few dishes. We started with 2 appetizers: blue lake bean tempura with pickled ginger soy and the soft shell crab tempura (a special not on the menu). Both were yummy, yet if I had to pick one it would be the bean tempura. The crab tempura may have been a little hard to share because there were 6 of us. I ordered skate as my main dish, which came with cauliflower and mashed potatoes. I ate every last bite of this dish! It was excellent. Note: it was a special that night and not on the regular menu. My friends ordered: the mushroom rice with grilled prawns, scallops with orzo (special), and three ordered the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. I got to sample each of these dishes. The sea bass was "melt in your mouth" delicious. The scallops, which is one of my favorite sea food dishes, were wonderful as well. And you can't go wrong with the prawns. Finally, we ordered 2 desserts. Yea, we had a feast! We ordered the apple pie and the chocolate cake with coffee ice cream on top. Our table favored the warm apple pie. Wow, I'm still thinking about it! Only one minor, yet not such a big deal, issue, is that we were seated later than our reservation, which was at 8:30PM (on a Saturday). Must have been about 15 minutes late or so. It was worth the wait!

This is the exact opposite of my kind of restaurant. It's Asian fusion. It's a sardine can. And it's in North Beach, which is half nasty nightclubs and half tourist traps. This restaurant also doesn't need another review, but I'm compelled to write one because the food is not only great, it's a great value for San Francisco. I came here for my birthday dinner last year and for a double date last month, and I've eaten just about everything. Your birthday is a good time to be obnoxious by sampling your guests' food at will. I enjoyed my second visit more, though, because I could don a t-shirt with jeans and eat like a T-Rex. A few of the dishes are of dinosaur proportions (e.g., wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak)! The menu is short and simple, yet diverse and thoughtful. My favorite appetizers were the deep-fried salmon roll and roasted unagi. I don't generally care for the texture of either, but wow--these were winners. The only appetizer I didn't like was the deep-fried chicken liver because there were just too few gems in that haystack of a salad. I already eat slowly, I don't need to waste time hunting and gathering the good stuff. As for the entrees my favorite was the butterfish special with crab sushi. The butterfish rivaled that of Roy's (http://www.yelp.com/bi...) and the crab sushi put it over the top--this is one to not share, even with a birthday girl. The wasabi house hoodles, grilled sea bass, and Niman Ranch pork chop are all great as well but simply incomparable. Dinner for two could range from $50 to $100. This is a lot for Asian but reasonable for fusion. I highly recommend reservations unless you're a native Italian and ok with having dinner at 10pm--but if you're a real Italian, North Beach is definitely not your scene.

I've heard so many good things about The House for the longest time (mostly the 4.5 stars averaged over 1700 reviews) and finally got to come try it a couple nights ago. The venue is indeed pretty small, but gives you a more intimate and cozy feeling....kinda like your house! Perfect for small parties or a date, Definitely make reservations! The food was amazing. I've always enjoyed asian fusion but this place definitely highlights how great it can be. We got the ahi tuna tartare and seared scallops with caviar that were both amazing. Entree wise, we got the wasabi noodles w/flat iron steak cooked medium rare to perfection, and also the black cod as their special. Debated on whether to try the seabass or the cod and I'm definitely glad that I chose the cod. It was so soft and buttery, just amazing! I also loved the veggies and the longest ever california roll that went with it. Everything was cooked to perfection. The cold sake was also a great accompaniment to the seafood meal, and the service was also fantastic throughout. Of course, can't forget the dessert! Got the dark chocolate truffle cake with coffee ice cream, which was great but I must admit dessert isn't their highlight. Definitely would come back again in the future =)

If you ever crave for Asian fusion cuisine, The House is the place to be. Ê Parking was a pain but you could valet park in the back. ÊService was fast. ÊFood came out shortly after putting in the order. Ê I took Connie C's recommendations and ordered the miso black cod and seared scallops. ÊSpot on. ÊBoth dishes were amazing. ÊFish was flaky and moist with a sweet reduction, just melted in my mouth. ÊScallops were warm, soft and seared perfectly. Ê Get both dishes if you dine there. Ê Definitely will go back for more.

Came here last night for the first time to have dinner with some good friends. I am simply blown away. Ahi Tuna Tartare is so freaking delicious. Porkchop was so tender and flavorful. SEA BASS is a MUST. Melts in your mouth GOOD! There are two downsides to this place. Its VERY small and crowded. You are basically bumping elbows with the table next to you. Parking is horrible. If you ever go to SF, you know that parking is a total b*tch. Make reservations and come EARLY to find parking. There are also parking garages around. Besides that, I highly recommend this place. I already want to go back!

hey guys. I don't remember the last time I did a yelp review, but after eating at this restaurant this past weekend, I haaaaaaad to get on here and talk about how f*#!%n delicious it was. ÊThis restaurant is seriously one of the BEST restaurants I've eaten at. ÊI'll break it down: (rating 1-5) Appetizers: Oysters = I give it a 4 Ê/ Served 6 fresh small oysters on a bed of ice with lemon & good sauce. Deep Fried Salmon = 5! / ÊServes 4 with shredded veggies at the bottom & a good Êstrong wasabi dip. Ê Entrees: Grilled Sea Bass with Garlic Noodles = 5! / They serve a good size sea bass with sauce, & garlic ginger soy veggies & garlic noodles. ÊThe sea bass seriously melts in your mouth & has enough flavor where you don't need to add sauce. ÊThe garlic noodles are hella good too, just as good as PPQ; maybe better ;) Pork Chop = 5! / Whaaaaaat was this really pork? Sure didn't taste like it. ÊCuz It was sooooo tender & soooo juicy. The sauce/glaze was too much to handle. Ê Dessert: Pineapple Upside Down Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream = 5! / The cake was served on top of a rasberry yogurt sauce. ÊMe & my bestie kilt it! Service = 5! Our waitress was very informative & attentive & gave good recommendations & wine pairings. Ê FYI = This restaurant is tiny so make reservations to save time, BUT since it's located near Broadway, parking is a bitch. So expect to come an hour before your reservation. Ê Enjoy!!

With almost 2000 reviews I am pretty hesitant about writing a review BUT I figured since I enjoyed this place so much I should. Came here with my parents and my cousin last month. We were visiting from LA and was looking for something different to eat since we wanted to try a new place than our usual places that we would go to when we are in San Francisco. So after going through Yelp we decided to go to The House since it was walking distance from our motel. We walked in and it took awhile for someone to acknowledge us. When they did they told us that there would be an hour wait since they were all booked and that they would call us when they had a table. 15 mins later they called us to tell us someone had not shown up for their table so they were going to let us have the table. When we came back we were seated right away. Inside is really small and you can kind of hear the conversation at the table next to you. They offer a lot of different specials for the night there was something for each course and we took advantaged and ordered most of them. For an appetizer we ordered the grilled calamari. This dish was okay it didn't amaze me. I ordered one of the specials of the night scallop and orzo pasta. This was AMAZING!! The scallops was cooked perfectly and mixed with the orzo pasta it was a nice smooth flavor. Around the outside of the bowl they had some spicy oil so every now and then I will mix it with the bite I was having so it can give it that kick. I took a picture of it but my flash was acting up (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) My cousin got the other special of the night Black Cod with California Rolls. Their rolls are not cut like traditional cut rolls this one cut down the middle leaving you two long pieces of California rolls. In addition they didn't use imitation crab meat but actually crab meat so that was a plus. The fish itself was very moist and the sauce with it accompanied it very well. My parents got the popular dishes that The House offers, one the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy and the Angus rib eye steak, house made teriyaki, toasted garlic better. Both dishes were very good and lived up to the hype they have been getting with these dishes. Finally we ended up the night by getting the chocolate cream pie and the special Japanese pumpkin cheesecake. Personally, I really enjoyed the Japanese pumpkin cheesecake more, but that may be because I am not a chocolate person. The cheesecake was warm and had a scoop of ice cream on top and the best part is that it wasn't too sweet. Oh and we ordered the Almond cookies to go because we saw some other people ordering it. It wasn't the traditional type of almond cookie this one was more like a butter cookie with a giant kick of almond. I enjoyed being able to take this home and enjoying at my own pace.

This place has good food, but I'm just not that into asian fusion. ÊYou can basically get same/similar dishes at a Japanese restaurant for a cheaper price. ÊThis place isn't expensive for what you get, but there are just better places to go. ÊStill A-OK though. I would only go back if someone really wanted to eat here.

This place lives up to all the reviews. ÊEverything was great to awesome! ÊI'm sure I'm not contributing anything new so I'll keep it short. Ê The sea bass was cooked perfectly. ÊI have never had a sea bass that was cooked to perfection like that. ÊIt was like butter. Ê Hands down the best dish of the night. ÊJust pure awesomeness! On any other night the flank steak with wasabi noodles would have been the star but against the sea bass it takes a distant second. Ê mmmm....sea bass.....mmmmmm

This place is great! The food is excellent from the taste to the presentation. Only gripe is that this place is so packed all the time that I don't get to enjoy the setting. The chairs and tables are packed so close to each other that I could practically reach over and steal my neighbor's wine glass. I've been here twice. The second time, the waitress was a bit rude. She read off the specials like she hated her job without even a crack of a smile. Other than that, I would come here again.

Underwhelming, to put it mildly. If this menu was wearing jeans, they would be acid wash. ÊAnd not the ironically hip kind, either. ÊAhi tuna tartare? ÊFried calamari? ÊReally? Ê1995 called, and it wants its menu back. If you think fish or meat prepared with soy and/or wasabi is exotic, you will probably be very happy here. ÊIf you're expecting to find local seasonal ingredients combined creatively, this place is not for you. I had the ribeye, which was gristly and at times difficult to cut due to the strings of fat running through it. ÊMy mediocre main was accompanied by the unwelcome aroma of patchouli wafting over from the nearby table packed with overly pierced bridge-and-tunnel kids. There are much better places to take your taste buds.

Cliff notes: One of the best meals I've had in a while. You can certainly find things you get at The House elsewhere, but the thing is, they do things slightly different and slightly better. For instance, ÊI had the Rib-eye and my girlfriend had the grilled Sea bass. Both are very common within the realm of restaurant ingredients...but seldom are these ingredients turned into something so delicious for the price point of The House. My rib-eye was cooked precisely as requested (med-rare). The aromas and flavors that came from this one piece of meat were incredible to say the least. My girlfriend's grilled sea-bass was buttery and full of flavor as well. Since we weren't disappointed yet, we decided hey, why not get some dessert? So dessert we got. Apple Crumb pie ala mode and creme brulee were our choice of the night and I must say they did not disappoint. These dishes weren't done extra fancy or anything, but what made them amazing was the fact that the chef's didn't take the term dessert as an excuse to create a dish able to resuscitate a Type 2 diabetic. Harmony was the game-plan and it shone through time and time again in the dishes. Whether this theme is purposeful or not, I will need to find out with more visits in the future. If I have any complaints, it would not be for the food, or the service. The wait staff here, as busy as they are, apparently can read minds and take care of whatever needs to be done efficiently and without asking. At the same time, they are not so 'attentive' as to come off intrusive...because god knows it would take a lot to separate me and any food placed in front of me from here. About my complaint; well this place can get a bit crowded, and because of that also bit too cozy and warm. Don't be surprised if you knock elbows or somebody's behind as they walk by. (0_0) Verdict: A must-try place, not really a date spot I'd say....this is the type of spot you would take that special somebody...because they've earned it...or if you've really screwed up, then this'll get you out of that bind as well.

Asian fusion at it's best. start with the white shrimp dumplings and or salmon rolls. the sea bass is "broke the mouth" good and my favorite! enjoyed this place a dozen times and a special little nugget that always impresses my lunch or dinner guests. fast service and great daily specials. save room for desert as they are outstanding and not to be missed. suggest a reservation if possible but is worth the wait if need be. best for a small group. great place to take your cool foodie client for lunch or good place to show your dinner date that you have culture.

almost 2,000 reviews with an average of 4.5 stars? that makes my review almost objective and not subjective, right? this is my number 1 restaurant to eat at whenever i visit SF. i never order anything else except for the seabass. that perfectly cooked piece of fish and THAT sauce. i want to bottle it up and take it home! i tried to replicate it a home but have always failed miserably. the veggies (whether snap peas or chinese string beans) were perfectly cooked and still retained a crunch but had great flavor. you can order rice instead of noodles but the noodles are delicious. the servers and owner were amazing, as usual. note: make reservations!!! you won't regret it. : P

Yes, the sea bass is buttery and delicious like everyone says but don't forget about the salmon!! Especially if you are in the mood for something less heavy.

I am so glad i found this place on yelp. I am usually not a fan of asian fusion but this restaurant changed my preferences. I was desperately looking for a late night place to eat after my flight and the house was open till 2am! My boyfriend booked the reservation for 10pm (yes it's a very late dinner) and when we got there, the restaurant was still very crowded. We shared the wasabi house noodles with steak and the sea bass with noodles. Everything was full of flavor and you can definitely taste each element that they put in the dish. The restaurant is pretty cramped and you can literally eat out of the neighboring table's food and parking took forever to find (we walked like 6 blocks) but overall I think it is worth it to make a trip out here.

The food is really THAT good! So I ended up back at The House 3 months after my first visit. I was with 5 other friends and I have to say that everyone had a wonderful dining experience. Even my vegetarian friend was raving about her curry noodles and her side of asparagus with sesame. I made sure to order the pork chops and it was so tasty! The soft shell crab with vermicelli noodles appetizer was impressive and the skate with trouffle sauce ("trouffle" is magical) made me drool. Still one of my favorite places! --------------------------------------------- Yelp you never fail me. The food at The House was AMAZING! The rib-eye was the perfect blend of flavors, the yellow tail with chinese broccoli topped with wassabi cream sauce melted in my mouth, and the california roll was made with delicious fresh crabs. The fried salmon roll we ordered for appetizer was addicting (watch out for the hot mustard dip though; just a little dip is enough to fire up your taste buds). The restaurant is small and the tables are set almost too close for comfort. Because of the tiny space, the noise level can get pretty high. And you definitely should make a reservation. There was nothing special about the service, but you receive your order pretty timely and everything on the menu sounds so delicious, who cares if the server doesn't know how to smile! I live in LA but I would readily drive to SF tomorrow to try the pork chops everyone raves about (the five girls at the table next to us all ordered pork chops and left none for me).

My bff and I were about to share one order, but we looked at each other and said....."naw....we should get our own!" lol and we did! And we both finished ours! We also had the wasabi noodles, which were also deeeeee-lish! The place is very cramped and small, but so worth it.

I had the pork, which came with mashed potatoes and asparagus, and it was amazing. I don't think I've ever enjoyed pork this much! My wife got vegetables and noodles in curry, and enjoyed her dish as well, but it wasn't amazing as mine was. The service was excellent. The waitress took time to answer all our questions and make recommendations, our drinks stayed full (even our water), we were brought new utensils after our appetizers, and generally felt like the staff at The House cares about making your experience one to remember. The reason I have not left a 5 star rating is that there is a lack of vegetarian options. I feel that, with the talent they have in their kitchen, they should be able to offer a number of dedicated vegetarian Asian fusion dishes, instead of just substituting meat on a few of their noodle dishes.

We came here for my belated birthday dinner while we were visiting San Francisco. The place is real small, so it felt like the whole restaurant would fit just our party of 12 people, but of course, it fits more. ;) The host was real nice in trying to get our tables set up when we came for our reservation at 9:30PM, but we had to wait for others to finish eating and mingling. Luckily there was a bar nearby so some of us can go get a drink first while we waited. We started out with the oysters on the half shell with spicy cilantro mignonette. These were okay to me as I prefer my oysters charbroiled. My friends all love raw oysters, so I let them enjoy that. Since we had a large group, we decided to order 2 of each entree on the menu so that both the girls and guys can enjoy it. My fav entree was the mushroom rice with grilled prawns. It was delicious and had all the right flavors. It looked like there was something else in it that was moving, and I wasn't quite sure what it was. I'm just glad I tried it b/c it was so so good! The Niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce was also delicious, and the angus ribeye steak simply melted in my mouth. The place may be small, but it's worth the wait. Since it was me and my friend Kim's bday, we also got a serving of creme brulee and rich chocolate cake. I'm still waiting for those birthday candles to work their magic! Thanks to my girl Shelly for recommending this place as I had a wonderful bday dinner with great friends! CHEERS!

After a long day of walking around downtown, my sister and I were hungry! ÊI called in and the only reservation they had was for 10pm. ÊWe walked by to see what the estimated wait time would be and we were told about 30-45 minutes. ÊPerfect timing for us to go home, drop off our things and come back out. ÊWe stood at the door for less than a minute before they seated us. ÊThis was probably my 4th time dining here. ÊI am always happy with the service and their knowledge of the food. ÊThe servers always have the specials memorized (usually a list of 4 starters and 3 entrees). STARTER: ÊWe choose the ahi tuna tartare for our starter. ÊIt was okay. ÊI love the roasted nori chips that it came on. ÊShould have tried the kobe steak tartare instead, but I kept thinking that I'd rather go back to BIX for a great steak tartare. ENTREE: ÊThe first 3 times I always had the black cod. ÊIt's THAT GOOD. ÊBut then they didn't mention it as a special tonight so it provided me with the opportunity to try something different. ÊI decided to try their warm wasabi house noodles with the angus flatiron steak. ÊI really enjoyed the little spicy taste that came with the wasabi noodles and the steak was cooked perfectly. ÊMy sister had the halibut in a curry sauce. ÊShe liked it a lot, especially the garnish on top. ÊIt was like fried shredded carrots or something. DESSERT: ÊWe shared the coconut creme brulee with passion fruit puree and the chocolate espresso bread pudding with vanilla ice cream. ÊThe coconut creme brulee was divine. ÊSuper creamy, which went great with the layer of crunchy sugar. ÊI personally could have done without the passion fruit puree, but it's perfect for those who like tart desserts. ÊThe bread pudding was more like a cake. ÊIt was super soft and went well with the vanilla ice cream. Reservations are a must for larger groups. ÊIf you don't have reservations and have a party of 2-4, I recommend to walk in, leave your name and number (usually a 30-60 minute wait) head up to the King of Thai on the corner and enjoy some $2 draft beers or $6 shots/cocktails while you wait.

Dayummmmmmm.... this restaurant is the shizznit as they say! The husband unit decided we would go out for a date night and introduced me to this wonderful place. At first you walk in and see this teeny tiny place with every table full. We were seated immediately and scored with the one and only window seat, great for people watching. We ordered: -raw oysters (superb, the chili sauce served with them Divine) -mushroom soup (decadent, rich and finger licking good) -ribeye (soft, flavorful and buttery as a steak should be) -halibut with mussels in a coconut creme sauce (knock your socks off) -chocolate cake (had a bite, ok for me, I'm one of those rare people that doesn't like chocolate) the husband devoured it so I suppose it was to his liking -house Pinot Grigio (perfect compliment for the halibut) So many other dishes looked just as good, our neighbors to the right had Divine looking sushi, pork chops and ahi tuna... The service is kind, quick and cool. We felt like a well taken care of guest. Parking: totally based on luck in the area, we scored one a block away Now I understand why my husband totally raves about this place, he and his coworkers have been here many times and never had a bad meal. I can't wait to go back again, I would definitely like to try the pork chop and sea bass entrees. Oh and the great looking apply pie ala mode.

It had been years since I had been here for dinner, and I don't know why I waited so long! ÊThis place has been around for a reason because it's cozy, homey with nice service and food that is sooooo tasty! ÊYou can see how much care they put into every dish as each one looks like a mini work of art! Ê For our July birthdays, Christine and I started out with a shared crab cake that was perfectly crispy on the outside and oh so meaty and tasty on the inside! ÊMmm! ÊWe had a hard time picking among the many meat, fish, chicken and seafood entrees on the menu, and plus, they had a good list of specials that made choosing even harder. Ê I chose the pork chop with pomegranate sauce -- loooooved it! ÊTender, yummy and the pomegranate sauce was nicely complimentary to the pork. ÊI would definitely order this again. ÊThen! I had the apple crumble a la mode - if I see a dessert with apple in it on the menu, I am automaticaly drawn to it, and I was not disappointed! ÊSweet, crispy with creamy vanilla ice cream - a nice birthday treat! Ê:) Definitely make a reservation because this place is relatively small, but it's small enough so that the noise level doesn't get too crazy. ÊYou can catch up with your friends without screaming. ÊAnd the service was nice and attentive. Thank you, House! ÊI will be back!!

Warm wasabi house noodle with salmon. Super Awesome. Good friendly service, made good recommendations on the menu. I would certainly go back whenever I was in the area & possibly seek it out to keep up on any of their new creations.

Legit came here after eating dinner at some Korean restaurant that wasn't memorable at all. Ê My friends and I ordered the Tuna for starter. ÊIt was quite tasty and I thought the tuna tasted great but nothing mind blowing. ÊAs for the main dish, we shared the Wasabi Noodles with Steak between the 3 of us (they probably weren't too happy). ÊI overall really liked the dish and thought the noodles were the perfect consistency with a hint of wasabi. ÊSO GOOD! ÊI would just eat the noodles alone. Having been my second dinner, I didn't get the chance to fully explore their menu but fear not, I will be back.

The food is very good, BUT I WAS TREATED MORE POORLY HERE THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN TREATED IN A RESTAURANT IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I'll be fair with my review -- the food was 4 stars, but the attitude was a zero star; so I've averaged it to two. Parking is difficult. We had difficulty finding a spot and showed up 14 minutes late. I was told that our reservation expired after 15 minutes, even though there was an empty table. Even though I showed the host that my iPhone said we were only 14 minutes late, he copped an attitude and refused to seat us. Then he refused to acknowledge our presence. What a jerk! Despite an open table that was never filled, we were made to wait. When I asked if we could be seated at the empty table, the host said we would have to wait because we had forfeited our reservation by being late. A subsequent reservation came in for a different party size, and they had to wait for an appropriate sized table. No party of our size came in, and our original table was left empty. Not until another table finished were we seated. Our original table was left empty until AFTER we had been seated and subsequent guests arrived.

This place isn't Asian-Fusion, but more of a New American style with Asian flavoring. ÊThe dishes are beautifully presented and rich (but not overwhelming) in flavor, but most on the menu try to imitate any trademark dishes. Ê(I really find it necessary to clarify since I hate Asian Fusion places normally.) My date and I both ordered steaks (2 different types), an appetizer, and lychee black teas. ÊEverything was delicious. ÊServing sizes were generous. ÊThe service was great. Ê My only possible qualm is how small the place is, so remember to make a reservation!

My lady friend got us reservations for The House for Valentine's Day this year, and she definitely gets points for picking this spot. We walked up to people spilling out of the restaurant into the street- and were seated after a few minutes (much to everyone's chagrin around us waiting!). We were seated at a four top, which gave us a ton of space. We ordered a bottle of wine, the scallops (which were to die for), and I got the cod with sushi roll- it came out looking like a dragon, which I loved. My lady got the steak with chanterelles. Both plates were beautiful and delicious. The details the staff paid attention to here were really what set it apart from other restaurants. I would highly recommend this spot!

Don't come here if you have high blood pressure...it's dangerous for your health. ÊIf you love sodium though, this is your place to be. Ê I had the famous sea bass with wasabi udon noodles & green beans. ÊDinner would have been great except that everything was oversauced with salt & garlic until the dish was unpalatable. ÊMy friend had one of their specials, which was scallops with some kind of pasta in cream sauce. ÊThe scallops were delicious, but everything else was also way too salty & creamy (which was a little unexpected for an asian fusion place). ÊWe also had a special tuna sashimi appetizer, which was the exact opposite of everything else - it was too bland & flavorless. Ê The hostess and wait staff also weren't particularly nice...I think our waitress had a hard time remembering the appetizer and entree specials. ÊAlso, the table next to us spotted a cockroach on the wall of the restaurant, which was kind of disgusting.

Ê Our server was extremely helpful with the menu and although each and every special she mentioned made our mouths water, we decided to go with a few things on the menu: Appetizer: ÊDeep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard - So light and absolutely decadent.

Just adding a quick update since I just went back to the House after some time and it blew my mind. They had a braised pork shoulder in spicy miso and it was one of the best dishes I've ever had -- definitely in the same league as their crispy pork belly (that I raved about so much in my previous review). I also got the soft shell crab tempura appetizer and it was incredible as well. In my book, the House has just jumped leaps and bounds to become one of the very best restaurants that SF has to offer.

I met a friend here for dinner because he could not stop raving about the food. I've read good reviews but never thought to make the trek to north beach for it. We made a reservation for 6:30pm for two and when we arrived it was already packed! If you do not have a reservation, don't plan on getting a table. The place is small and compact. You are literally going to be sitting next to the other person from the other table. We ordered the usual that most Yelpers seem to get, the sea bass and the wasabi noodles w/ flank steak. The noodles with flank steak was superb. The sea bass was cooked to perfection. I have never had it prepared in that way. It was delicious. For dessert, fellow yelper Fancy Pants, suggested the tapioca. Pretty darn good. I'll come back for sure. Service is attentive as it can be for a busy small restaurant. Reservations are a must. Try the dishes that other Yelpers suggest. They know what they are eating.

We came to SF for a weekend getaway, and visited The House for dinner on Saturday night and lunch on Monday afternoon. This place was so good that we had to visit twice over the course of our 4 day vacation. For dinner, the Mister and I shared the salmon roll for our appetizer, which had salmon cooked medium wrapped up and deep fried with a mustard dipping sauce ($9). The Mister got the special entree for the night, which was a braised pork shoulder on a bed of orzo pasta with a hint of truffle oil ($28.) For me, I had the grilled sea bass with beans and garlic noodles ($26.) The fish was so flakey and moist, and the dipping sauce that comes with the fish goes perfectly well. For lunch, we ordered the green beans tempura as a starter, curried chicken noodles, and wasabi noodles with salmon for our entrees. All the dishes were very delicious and portions are generous. Prices are very reasonable for lunch, roughly $10-$12 a plate. For anyone living in SF or visiting SF, this place is a must try restaurant!

This is one of the best kept secrets in SF. It is a tiny restaurant in the middle of Tourist town USA so you would think it is a tourist trap in North Beach but it is far from it!

Pre-Valentine's Day dinner at The House was the best idea ever. I thought their lunch was good, but their dinner blew me away. I can seriously say this was one of the best meals of my life. That may not mean much, but it does to me. Also, please note that I do not normally order fish at restaurants unless it is battered and fried. The House has changed the way I look at fish. I love it now! Everything I tasted was devine. The caesar salad with crispy scallops was the best salad I've had in a while. I love how they used the scallops as croutons! I even had a couple of raw oysters, which to me, is a HUGE deal. The spicy cilantro vinegarette was the perfect accompaniment for the raw oysters. For my entree I had the black cod special. It was pan roasted to perfection with a crispy layer on top and nice flaky fish inside. The miso sauce was scrumptious. I wanted to lick the plate clean! I also loved the idea of serving a California roll with the cod. Everything on the plate was fantastic! Tips: make an early reservation on a Saturday evening (5pm) and you won't have to wait at all. The service was quick but not rushed. If you want to go all out, you will pay the price but it's worth every penny. You could easily experience The House on a budget. Share an appetizer (the caesar salad or the salmon rolls), get your own entree and share a dessert (the truffle cake is a MUST). I told my BF that I would give up eating out all month in exchange for going to The House once a month. It was that serious.

i must say i haven't written a yelp review in quite sometime but this place might have just inspired me to tap on the key board once again. I decided to go here with my family & best friend for my birthday dinner. I made reservations earlier in the week and the only spot they had available was right at opening. early dinner? i didn't mind. My family & I being the hippos we are ordered almost everything on their menu plus the specials. Everything was to die for! There was hardly any conversation at the table as we stuffed our faces other than the occasional "Mmmmmm" & "Oh my God this is good, you want some?" The pork chop with the pomegranate currant sauce might have been one of the best pieces of meat i have ever put into my mouth (dirty thoughts aside haha). Reminded me of that sweet and savory filipino style bbq pork on a stick but taken to a whole nother level. We also ordered the salmon rolls with the yummy hot mustard sauce, calamari, soft shell crab dish, the garlic ribeye was amazing, a curry seafood special, and a few other dishes if forgot but thoroughly enjoyed. After dinner was over still high off the food binge i discovered the best mango dessert OF MY LIFE. You know the little mango puddings you order at dim sum places with the evaporated milk on top, well they have their own version here & it is soooo good I will never go back to that $1.50 crap. Their MANGO TAPIOCA was slightly firm full of tiny tapicoa balls, jus the right consistency and on the top was a foamy whipped cream that shits on that cheapy evaporated milk stuff on the regular puddings. We ordered the two other desserts they were good but the failed in comparison to my favorite. Thank you House for a wonderful birthday dinner! You bet I will be back even if its jus for my lovely mango tapioca :)

I originally came here with the intention of trying one of the specials that looks absolutely amazing--the miso black cod with california rolls, but sadly they didn't have it the night I went! :( so I had to be flexible and order something else.. 1) Roasted unagi with avocado sushi rice-I literally expected a plate of rice with sides of unagi and avocado (which I would've LOVED because I like all 3 of those things!) but this was very similar to a sushi roll and comes topped with fish flakes. Kind of oily, but delicious nonetheless. 2) Pomegranate Pork Chops-the pork chops were extremely tender and the pomegranate currant sauce had an unique flavor and was so good! It's actually pomegranate pork chop....but that's okay. I also tried some of my friend's seabass and it was soft, juicy, and tender as well. :) The only downsides of this place were that our waitress was so busy she never refilled our waters until we were almost done eating :l good thing my friend bought a large bottle of water before coming so I was able to refill my glass with that, and I'm not really a big fan of restaurants with dim lighting. I guess it's good for intimate dates though! And I would definitely make a reservation for this place if you don't want to wait long because there is extremely limited seating. My friend called at 4 PM that day and their only available time slot was 9 PM. I will definitely be back for my miso cod and california rolls!!

We had reservations at 8pm on a Monday night and the place was packed! Although we had rsvp we still had to wait at least 15min. Once seated me and my foodie friends were so anxious to ask what the specials were and just dying to order! For appetizers we had the spare-ribs and seared scallops. Both were wonderful, but the scallops and it's sauce was to die for! Entrees we all shared the flat iron steak with wasabi noodles, black cod and the kobe beef. Everything was pretty good, but the standout dish was the cod. It was just so soft and flavorful. I don't usually order fish, but that dish really blew me away. Dessert we shared the creme brulee with passionfruit puree. I think the passionfruit was a bit overpowering with the tartness that it just didnt complement the creme brulee at all. So that was a dissapointment.

I've had my fair share of Asian fusion restaurants and The House did not meet my usual high expectations of what Asian fusion food is supposed to taste like. ÊIf I could describe the House's food in 4 words, I'd describe it as: "expensive 'fancy' Chinese food". My friend and I ordered for appetizers: Ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips Deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard For entrees: Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak Grilled ahi tuna (rare) with spicy mustard aioli We had gone with the recommendations as was recommended per yelp, and for the most part, the appetizers were pretty tasty, light, and quite good. ÊThe ahi tuna tartare was cool and crisp and created an interesting conflicting texture with the crunch of the nori chips. ÊIt was an almost surprisingly pleasant place. ÊThe fried salmon roll was basically a piece of salmon wrapped in seaweed and deep-fried. ÊWhen I saw "roll" I thought it was a deep fried sushi roll, but it was a whole hunk of salmon. ÊOnce again, there was a conflict of textures between the crunch of the deep-fried outer layer with the squishiness of the salmon--which was a surprising but interesting mix. ÊIt was accompanied with a spicy mustard sauce (typical Chinese hot mustard) which gave it a nice kick--so spicy that it cleared my sinuses. Now onto the entrees, which were not as good as I had hoped. ÊThe food was cooked in an exorbitant amount of the oil, that it felt like my tongue was swimming in a pool of oil. ÊMy chin literally was sopping with oil, and no, I'm not a messy eater. ÊMy pores were exuding the excess oil that I had consumed from my oily entrees. The sea bass was soft and tender, but besides that it was DRENCHED in oil. ÊMy cholesterol probably went sky rocket high after eating that sea bass. ÊI always thought eating fish was supposed to be healthy, but based on this experience, it was not. ÊSimilarly, the sea bass was a little bit on the salty side. ÊThere was some soy sauce that accompanied the sea bass which basically was deemed unusable since the sea bass was already salty. ÊAs a side, the sea bass came with garlic noodles, which was topped off with an extreme number of onions, so that eating these garlic noodles tasted like I was eating onion noodles. ÊThe onion flavor overpowered any taste of garlic in these noodles. ÊLike the sea bass, the noodles were drenched in oil. ÊI managed to finish my dish, and at the bottom of my plate...was a pool of oil. ÊQuite frankly, that is not very pleasing to see. Ê My friend's wasabi house noodles with steak was similarly just as oily and salty. ÊWhen he had finished his dish, he was extremely full due to all the oil that caused such a satiating effect. ÊHe had told me his flavors were nothing novel, special, or worth writing home about--and was something he could cook himself. Chinese food is traditionally oily, and the House follows this "model"-- oily! ÊIn my opinion, the food here is "glorified" Chinese food--just more expensive, smaller portions, and slightly better presentation. Ê Talking about other aspects of the restaurant, the service is good--they keep on filling your water and keep on checking on how the food tastes, etc. ÊHowever, they had placed us right by the bathroom, as I had predicted, just because my friend and I look young. ÊA lot of restaurants think that younger people will not tip well, so they will place them right by the bathroom, despite having many other tables available for sitting at that time. Parking can be a nightmare too since parking in down town SF can be horrendous. ÊBut if you come around 6pm, you can park in the metered spaces for free. Overall, I give the restaurant a *2* star review based on the following reasons:: - 4* stars for good appetizers and good service - minus 2* stars for unhealthy amount of oil and salt used to cook their entrees, lack of novel concepts in their food, difficulty for finding parking, and seating us right adjacent to the bathroom despite having other available tables nearby. I understand my review might be viewed as a little harsh as compared to what other yelpers have said about this place, but I feel my rating is honest and fair. ÊI've had my share of Asian/Asian fusion food to know that Asian fusion *typically* is tasty, novel, and healthy -- and the House did not meet my high standards. ÊI had expected a lot more from this restaurant due to the excellent ratings here on Yelp, but it really didn't cut it. ÊI truly am not impressed by dousing everything in soy sauce, salt, and oil. ÊThat is *NOT* in any way Asian fusion.

Sigh. As much as I love this place, I have to knock it down a couple stars for my last visit here. Something just wasn't right. The mussels tasted a bit on the fishy side. The sea bass was still good, but the pork chop wasn't as good as I remembered. Worst of all, though, was the hurried service. You can tell they were trying to rush us out. They even brought out our entrees while we were still working on appetizers! The "rush" was so blatantly obvious, that I had to call them out on it. I do plan on coming back here again, eventually, so I hope my next experience will be good again so they can redeem their 2 stars.

I live near Washington Square so I've eaten at almost every restaurant in the area. The House is easily the best restaurant within a 1 mile radius of the park. The dishes are creative, presented beautifully, and very reasonably priced. ÊI usually come here during lunch because there's typically a line out the door during dinner (unless you arrive very early). Most things are good, but my favorites off the lunch menu are the flatiron steak, sea bass, and wasabi noodles. ÊI also love their lychee iced tea. ÊNow onto the bad...I tried the soup noodles once only to be seriously pissed when I discovered that the restaurant does not have soup spoons!!! ÊThey give you a regular metal spoon which is completely inadequate for downing a giant bowl of soup noodles. ÊAlso, avoid the unagi avocado sandwich. A friend of mine ordered it once and found it extremely disappointing.

I think I might have a new favorite restaurant in SF! I was taken here yesterday for my birthday after a friend highly recommended it and it blew all expectations. I was hesitant of being disappointed with such high yelp reviews, but this place is the real deal. I also rarely get my mind blown away with restaurants because I typically feel I can cook most dishes almost as well as the restaurant, however these dishes were phenomenal. I've never been able to cook a piece of fish as perfectly as this! FOOD: Big-Eye Tuna Sashimi with salsa verde- a great portion of super fresh sashimi over a yellow beet sliver topped with a slice of nori, salsa verde, avocado chunks, radish and tobiko. There was a lot going on in this dish but it all worked in perfect harmony. Deep Fried Salmon roll: very tasty and served with a chinese hot mustard sauce. Fantastic a must try Seabass with Garlic ginger soy noodles: I was hesitant to order seabass just because most fish doesn't ever really impress. However this seabass and the black cod that we got were the best two dishes of fish I've ever had. I didn't understand melt in your mouth until eating these dishes. You could take the back handle of a butter knife and "cut" into the fish. Be careful of the soy ginger sauce (served on the side) though the fish is amazing on it's own and doesn't really need the sauce. Black cod served over some greens and topped with an open faced "california" roll- definitely the wow dish of the night. Take a look at the picture below but it was just beautiful. Another perfectly cooked piece of delicious fish that just melted away in your mouth- that's what she said! seriously though I had to ask the waitress what the dark sauce under it was and all she could say was soy and ginger anything else and i'd have to kill you. I literally scraped up a bit of it with my finger just to get a better taste of it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_É Chocolate truffle cake with espresso ice cream, coconut cream, caramel- deliciously solid dessert. The food was absolutely delicious, beautiful and creative. The dishes came out with little lag between them. The service was great too- very efficient, almost a bit rushed. I highly recommend coming here and can't wait to return. FYI the Ê$15 corkage fee is a great option to bring some great wine in.

This is one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco hands down. The almost 1800 reviews don't lie, and i don't have to speak much about this place as most of the work has been done for me. Ê What I will say is that i highly recommend getting reservations here, the way i see it, if a place offers reservation, why not do it and avoid any hassle and/or potential waiting. The reason why I love The House so much is that you know whatever you order will be solid and the prices are very reasonable. I hate eating at a restaurant and feeling like my meal is a small piece of art, with 3 dots of sauce and a splash of this and a smudge of that with a tiny piece of meat in the center that i'm suppose to call my main course. ÊWith that said, the dishes at The House are not only beautifully presented, but generously portioned as well; imagine that! Appetizers: $6-12 I highly recommend the crab cake and the oysters if they have them Entree: $14-22 The pork chops w/ pomegranate sauce is amazing, i'm not a fan of ordering pork chops, but the pork chop at The House is extremely tender, melt in your mouth. quite amazing. I usually order the steak whenever i come and it never disappoints, comes out perfect medium rare just the way i ordered it, very flavorful with a great crust on it. Êperfection, and for about $25 you can't go wrong. I always have a great experience whenever i come to The House and i try to take my friends whenever i get the opportunity. ÊYou not only leave full and satisfied, but you won't have to pick up three extra shifts just to pay it off. ÊPerfect location to go out after dinner also. 5 solid stars!

Definitely need to make a reservation to eat here. Call for reservation. will order again: oysters on a half shell - fresh with spicy mignonette deep fried salmon roll - cooked on outside, medium raw on inside sea bass with garlic ginger soy - well-cooked, with noodles and green beans questionable: coconut creme brulee with passion fruit puree on top - the passion fruit was way to tangy and overpowered everything else. For a group of 5, I don't know if I felt like they were rushing us or trying to be efficient. We were out the door in just under an hour. More likely, all of us were extremely hungry haha. Another note, it was hard for me to hear all the specials from our server due to the noise and her accent. I would suggest printing them out on a dedicated specials menu since there's about 6-7 of them. Other than that, a good meal

The House. ÊHeard the rumors, had to go there one time. ÊWith my visiting girlfriend from Miami, I finally had an excuse to go and try The House. First off, the food is delicious, but the service sucks. ÊThere were two four person tables available the entire time, but the hostess let my date and I (who had reservations) just wait and stand for about half an hour before we got seated. ÊThere was nobody waiting except for us. Next, it was a sprint. ÊThey literally hurried all the dishes off to us and I felt like I was running a 100 yard dash rather than eating at a fancy restaurant. ÊI even purchased a bottle of wine so they would slow down, but they literally shoved the food and the bottle down my throat. ÊI felt like I was back in my college days chugging Franzia at the house. Finally, the food is great. ÊBEST SEA BASS I HAVE EVER EATEN. ÊI also had the steak, which also was so tasty, but the SEA BASS. ÊIf only they deliver, and I could get it to go. ÊIt's pretty tasty, but definitely not worth the service, so that is probably my last bite. Ê I gave it 4 stars because everyone should go and try the sea bass once, as it is life-altering, but makes you realize how much service affects your mood sometimes.

For 4.5 stars on yelp... I had some pretty high expectations but sadly I just couldn't put it up there with SF's finest in my book. Salmon roll ($10) - best part of the meal. If you like spicy, this wasabi sauce that comes with it is AMAZING wasabi house noodles and steak - so greasy, so heavy, so everything asian food should not be. The steaks were cooked to medium perfectly as we ordered but the accompanying noodles were like 'oil with a side of noodles' instead of 'noodles pan-fried in oil' sea bass - even heavier and greasier than the noodle/steak. The piece of fish was fresh but everything on this plate from the fish to the noodles to the greens were just doused in oil. I am no stranger to comfort food and can kill a bucket of KFC, but eating just half my meal here gave me heartburn... Don't get me wrong 3 stars for the taste and large portions but you'll probably won't be able to stomach this if you're body isn't accustomed to eating poorly

I have always liked The House, been here about 5 or 6 times? The food certainly never disappoints me but this review is clearly for the lack of good service. I understand that having a late arrival on a busy Saturday night can be frustrating but sometimes shit happens on the SF roads that are unpredictable. Our server was beyond rude.. maybe she was having a bad day? She forgot what the specials were and when she was taking our plates she was extremely rough and the sauce from our plates would splatter all over our table. Whenever we called for her attention she looked really annoyed. When our dessert came, our check came with it. We didn't even ask for our check yet! Maybe its cause its the weekend.. maybe its her. since the other servers looked less annoyed that night. If you plan on coming I advise you to come on a week night.

LOOOOOVEEEE this place! Been going to this place couple of times and each time I've been extremely pleased with the service and food. Nice ambiance and a good place to bring your dates over! Make sure you make a reservation for dinner because this place gets full most of the nights, especially on the weekends! Ê Food: Appetizer - Deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard Main Course - Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy, Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak I do feel that their desserts are mediocre. You can definitely get better desserts somewhere else. Aside from that, the appetizers and main dishes are a MUST to try. I would definitely come back to this place when I visit SF.

This is the VERY rare occasion that a much-hyped restaurant in this city actually lives up to expectations. Not to mention they actually do Asian Fusion right (also a rarity).

Great food! ÊA very small place that we had to visit twice because it was so crowded the first time we went there. ÊSo we came back the next day at opening time and barely got a table (had to be out of there in 1 hour due to reservation). ÊI ordered the sea bass and I've never had any fish that just melts in your mouth. ÊSeriously, I think the only way you accomplish this is with a pizza stone at 800+ degrees cooking. ÊOr a Big Green Egg. ÊHowever they did it, I was thoroughly impressed. Ê2 others at the table had the pork chop (not a fan of sweet & sour anything but the meat was perfectly cooked and not overdone) and the salmon (served on a bed of bok choy). ÊYou could tell that they take extreme care to get the freshest fish (sea bass tasted like they pulled it out of the water that same day as did the salmon) which is 75% of the battle in my book. We started with deep-fried soft-shell crab which was good but ultimately, just deep fried. ÊSigh - there's only so many ways to make grease taste something not like grease. We ended with the creme brulee. ÊInstead of just the burnt sugar on top, they managed to work in a blueberry/burnt sugar skin which worked well with the delicate creme. ÊWell done. MAKE RESERVATIONS. ÊIt's extremely difficult to get a table without.

Came here for a belated Valentines celebration with the gent. It was the best Valentines dinner! Also my 1st Valentines Day dinner ever. But that's beside the point. The House is sooooo yummy. Everything was just so perfect. The fried artichoke hearts were tasty. The scallops were divine! The gent ordered the Sea Bass with ginger soy-- Amazing. I ordered the Ahi Tuna, wonderfully seared! We were so lucky to have gotten there near closing, at our time of reservation, after finding thee most awesome parking spot. Everything fell into place this day. I think the fact that things went so smoothly, the food tasted even better. And the waitress was very sweet and honest when it came to what to order.

Wow, this is a small, fairly unassuming place, but boy was it delicious. ÊMake sure you make reservations here and take note of the mandated time limit you have to eat (I assume to move as many people through the restaurant as possible). ÊHowever, after going through these hoops to get a seat, you'll be nicely rewarded by delicious, straightforward food. ÊWhile it's not the most creative menu, it sure offers lots of specials, mostly around seafood. ÊIf you're a fish lover, definitely make a stop by the house. Starting off, we had the unagi over avocado rice, which was kind of like a deconstructed sushi. ÊAgain, a straightforward dish, but it was really flavorful. Ê For my main, I went with the much recommended (+1 here) sea bass. ÊHonestly, you don't even need the sauce that comes with it, as it's perfectly cooked and not too heavy. ÊTo my delight, it also came with some garlic noodles and string beans that I can never complain about. Ê In the end, if you're craving a dinner that won't make you feel too bloated, but rather, perfectly satisfied and enjoy seafood, come to the House.

Came here on my anniversary and it was oh so lovely.Very small restaurant but it doesn't feel crowded to the point where you feel uncomfortable. It was very cozy inside. I ordered their special for the day (i believe) : kobe beef tartare. OH MY GOD, the best I've had in a while.....on the bottom they had these little fried rice balls and slices of fruit (apple?) on top. AMAZING! Also had the crab cake thingys (bomb)and the pomegranate pork chop and bf had their steak w/mashed potatoes. For dessert we had the chocolate cake (soooo delicious...had a mouth orgasm cuz i love chocolate so much...) , I'd come back again for sure.

5 stars for the food! For starters we had: - Seared Scallops - Ahi Tuna Tartare - Deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard * Scallops were my favorite, but were also the special and not listed in the menu Entree - Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak - Mushroom rice with grilled prawns - Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy * All three dishes were amazing. Well prepared and presented Dessert - Warm Apple pie a la mode Drink - Riesling I agree with the other reviews that the place is small and very cramped. You have to make reservations in advance and parking is a nightmare. However, I wouldn't let those contributing factors take away from the fact that the food was delicious and decently priced.

This place earns a 4.99999 stars! If you come to San Francisco, you must make a visit to "The House" because I guarantee you will not be disappointed! I was VERY fortunate to come here with Mike C. to have the one of the most flavorful curry udon noodle with grilled chicken (no soup). This place knocked the side of my head because it was so tasty. I ordered the curry udon which was more like a stir fry ($11) with a twist on the Japanese influence. Nice and creamy and having the curry flavor surround each noodle. I tried the wasabi noodles with pork ($11) and it was unbelievable. Full of flavor and not as greasy as expected. The pork was super tender. Be sure to make reservations because at lunch this place was packed. The interior was contemporary and clean and the staff were helpful and prompt. As he said, "Run, don't walk here" is totally true! Parking sucks but what else do you expect in SF!!

I don't quite understand all the 5-star ratings on Yelp. ÊYes the food is good, but not mind-blowingly great. It's way expensive for what you get. The noodle dishes were on par with any decent Chinese restaurant - in fact there are many whole in the walls with far better fried udon noodles. The steaks and pork chops were clearly the highlights of the dinner - the mashed potatoes accompaniment were good, but I have had far better elsewhere. The string bean tempura was well executed on the crisp/light side, but lacked flavor (perhaps a little salt). Yes the food is good (I would say 4- stars) but definitely not 5-stars and definitely way expensive for the quality. Needless to say, nothing was memorable. good but not memorable.

A solid restaurant with excellent dishes! The House is one of those little gems that you come across every now and then, and once word gets out, seats/reservations are difficult to get! Although they specialize in Asian Fusion, what makes them different from others is their consistency in high quality as well as the delicious flavors, as well as the creativity that goes into their plating. The restaurant is small and cozy, so you'll be dining close to your neighbors. Also, may not be the best of places for a quiet dining experience. Prices are fair, especially for the portions..in the $18-$30/dish range. Make reservations during Friday/Saturday nights!

The House is a sort of hole in the wall, Asian Fusion eatery somewhat misplaced in the Italian neighborhood of San Francisco. Parking is definitely a challenge, as well as, getting a reservation. But the food makes the effort worth it for sure. The deep fried salmon rolls are really good. Also tried the pomegranate pork chop which is ok. But the real start entree was the cod. It simply melts in your mouth. I've never had anything like it before. Totally worth a trip or two back.

I came here today for a friend's birthday, and I was definitely unimpressed. I ordered the curry noodles, which was mediocre. What made my experience unpleasant, however, was the lack of service. I wouldn't even call the House's service "spotty", because even when a server spotted me my group trying to flag them down, they didn't even bother checking to see what was needed. After being seated, it took about 30 minutes to get our order taken (my group had to flag down a server 3 times) and about 25 minutes after eating to get our check (my group had to flag down a server 5 times, but I still had to go out to the register to ask for our check).

My girlfriend took me here on a date night, and wow, the food just blew me away. First off, make sure to make a reservation, because this place is small and quaint, and you will NOT get a table if you decide to just stroll in. ÊAlso, be prepared for turn-your-hair-white frustration as you find parking around this area. We started off with two appetizers: the calamari, and the Kurobuta pork cheek buns. ÊThe calamari was fried crispy and delicious, and the kimchee salad that came with it was equally delightful. ÊThe pork cheek buns were equally tasty, and left me longing for more after the two pieces were devoured. She had the Kurobuta pork chop for her entree, and I had the sea bass. ÊI really loved the pork...the meat was so tender, and the pomegranate currant sauce was a great compliment. ÊMy sea bass was great as well...perfectly cooked and seared, and the noodles on the side were so good it actually appeared in my dreams last night. My only complaint is that the food arrived fast...and by fast, I mean REALLY fast. ÊIt almost seemed like they were just jamming plates onto our table, something I'm not very used to in a higher-end establishment. Ê Still, I would have to say House is one of the best places I've been to in SF.

Don't you guys hate how cramped this restaurant is!? We had reservations for 2 at 6:30pm, and we were just 8 minutes late. So they didn't seat us right away. We ended up waiting an extra 10 minutes. There was however one table open, but it was a bigger table, most likely meant for a party of 3 or 4. All the two people tables are so effing small! So I guess they felt bad for making us wait, so SCORE! We got the big table. The OYSTERS never fail. We tried one of their special appetizers for the day, it was some kind of kobe beef salad. It was delicious. I believe that was my first time eating beef in my salad. If thats one of the specials on their menu that day, ORDER IT! My entree was the sea bass. It came with these fat noodles. Fat noodles over skinny noodles all day any day. I LOVE FAT NOODLES. I think it's because everytime I eat skinny noodles, I eat it so fast (because they're so thin!), that I forget to chew, and then it gets stuck in my chest. And it hurts. So yes I was a happy camper with my fat noodles and sea bass. And while everyone was being super classy with their wine, we ordered a pot of tea! I forgot the name of the tea, so let me check it real quick on their website! ....ok NVM! It's not on the website. But it was the first selection in the tea section. You must try! Tea is good for you.

Compared to the other reviews for The House I'm going to chalk my experience up to an off night for the kitchen. My girl friends surprised me with a birthday dinner on a Monday night and I was super excited to eat here because of all the rave reviews. Ê This restaurant is TINY, no joke, so expect to have a very cozy meal. For starters I split the deep fried salmon roll with Kat C.. ÊI love the crispiness of the exterior and it's perfect with that spicy chinese mustard. ÊThey're definitely not skimping on the salmon either, it's super dense. A couple of the ladies at the table including myself ordered the warm wasabi noodles with flatiron steak. ÊA couple minutes later our server came back to tell us that they only have enough flatiron for two orders! ÊCrisis averted since they were able to sub in some ribeye for the third order. ÊI really like the colorful vegetable slaw that comes with this dish and the portions are definitely generous. ÊI wish the noodles were more wasabi-y, ÊI didn't taste wasabi in them at all. ÊSomeone at our table also had a difficult time cutting through her steak and had to have it re-fired a little bit, which slightly helped. ÊSomeone at the table also ordered the chicken breast dish, which she was happy with. When it came to dessert time we didn't really see anything on the standard menu that we fancied but we wanted to try the bread pudding that was on special for that night. ÊThree seconds after we ordered it, our server came back to tell us that they had JUST run out..... really? UGH. Service was okay. ÊIt seems like there were only two servers that night and they were running around like crazy. At the end of the meal everyone was lamenting about how the last time they had eaten at The House it had been better... oh well. ÊMaybe I should heed Anthony Bourdain's advice and not eat out on Mondays...

ÊWe got the deep fried salmon rolls, the seared sea scallops, the grilled ginger soy sea bass, and the miso black cod. Ê The salmon roll was great, and the hot mustard sauce it came with had quite a kick, so just try a little before you drench the roll with it. ÊThe salmon roll was crispy and cooked on the outside and just barely seared on the inside, making for a delightful combination of flavors. ÊThe seared sea scallops was delicious, as all scallops cooked in butter should be. The black cod was outstanding! ÊThe flesh was soft and buttery, and both savory and sweet. ÊIt was even better than the sea bass in my opinion. ÊI think it's because they grilled the sea bass, which sort of ruins the texture of the fish. ÊSea bass should be steamed rather than grilled to take full advantage of it's naturally soft and buttery texture! ÊThe noodles that came with the sea bass was really good though. ÊIt was flavored with a garlicky soy sauce, and I think I could eat it all day. All in all, the food was very good. ÊIt was quite expensive as it came out to a little over $90 for the 2 entrees and Ê2 appetizers after tax and tip. ÊHowever, if you're gonna splurge for dinner, the House is a pretty good choice. ÊI'm a fan of Asian fusion when it's done well, and I can't wait to go back someday and try some of the other dishes that they offer here. Ê P.S. - the restaurant is pretty small and it's crowded in there, so it can get kind of loud.

Awesome little hole in the wall! Recommended by my coworker Allen. I have gone here 3 times so far =) The place definitely need a reservation at least a day in advanced. It can probably fit no more than 20-30 people, and all the tables are very close to each other. They definitely maximize the space usage. I ordered the tuna tartare, a sashimi dish, and the salmon rools for the appetizers! Both were very refreshing. While the wine list is quite extensive for a small fusion restaurant, the quality of the wines could use some refinement. The tuna tartare was really amazing and unique. It may even be better than Morimoto's in Napa. The chips that came with the tuna were delightful. The Sea Bass was exceptional: buttery, and melts in your mouth. It came with wasabi noodles that were a bit too salty. While most people do not order the pork chop at a nice restaurant, I beg you to try it! It was the most delicately cooked piece of meat that I have eaten. The sauce blends all the flavors together well and everything falls into place when you put everything in your mouth. The desserts were typical, and probably need some work. I was still euphoric from the main dishes! Definitely a great place place to bring a date since everyone is talking in the restaurant any way.

This is probably my favorite restaurant in San Francisco. Everything you eat here makes you say "wow!" The papaya salad appetizer is a must try. The only downside to this place is that it is always so crowded and can be difficult to go to on a whim. But worth the wait.

3.5 First I was a little annoyed that they put us in a little table that was right next to a huge party. I understand that the place is small but I made a reservation and there were clearly more spacious tables that were empty. Second, the service was kind of disorganized. No one told us they were our server and everyone seemed rushed and frazzled. It was a weekday evening, mind you. I wish they made us feel a little more welcome. Anyway, food. I really enjoyed the tuna tartare appetizer. Fantastic if you're starving. Presentation is nice as well. Nothing blew me away about the taste - it wasn't particularly unique, but it was delicious nonetheless. Perfect to share among 3-4 people. Would ruin my appetite for the entree if I had it by myself! I went with the miso black cod (the special that everyone raves about). It was such a large plate of food! The dish comes with 2 large pieces of California roll on top (fresh crab meat and avocado). While a unique and nice addition to the cod, I found these pieces extremely difficult to handle and eat in a decent manner. Moreover, the rolls kept falling into the miso sauce, which would have been alright had the sauce not been extremely salty. I understand that miso is quite salty to begin with, but this sauce was borderline-offensive salty. So I found myself frantically trying to keep my sushi rolls from falling into the sauce and trying to cut them into edible-portions. The cod itself is fantastic. As many reviewers have already pointed out, the fish melts in your mouth and is cooked to perfection. Again I found the sauce overbearing and almost unnecessary. The portion is great! I had a sample of the sea bass with noodles - good but kind of boring. I really liked the steak with wasabi noodles. I'd definitely get that if I came back. The noodles were pretty special and the steak was delicious. For dessert we got the chocolate cake. It was alright. I always have high expectations for chocolate cake and this one was only mediocre. Maybe the coconut creme brulee would have been a better choice! I think I would have enjoyed my dining experience more had 1. the service was more friendly and interested in us and 2. if we were not shafted to the tiniest table in the whole restaurant because we showed up early and 3. if the miso sauce on my black cod was less salty. I'd still try The House if you've never been because so many people clearly love it. The prices are not ridiculous and when you finally score a parking spot in North Beach, you'll be in a great mood for a tasty meal.

Went there for lunch today and the lunch menu looked appetizing. ÊI had the Wasabi noodles with Salmon and the flavors were ok. ÊI could not really taste the wasabi. ÊInstead, I got a bowl of hot sauce. ÊI love spicy food, but this wasn't spicy enough and did not taste like wasabi. ÊWasssssssup with that? Additionally, I ordered the special monterey grilled squid and it was tasty but not fab. Overall, I think I am just into food that tastes fresh and tastes like it is suppose to taste right now. ÊIf I order squid, I just want the flavors of the squid to pop with a bit of lemon or something... all the fusion ingredients are just masking the natural flavors versus enhancing it. ÊDid I mention the wasabi noodles did not taste like wasabi... at all?

Reservations are recommended but we saw plenty of walk-ins get seated w/o much of a wait. ÊFood lived up to expectations. ÊBoth the deep-fried salmon roll and the crab cakes were superb. ÊMy seabass w/ udon and green beans was pretty much perfect. ÊGreat crust and seasoning on the outside of the fish and perfectly cooked. ÊThe sauce it's served with is bold and the presentation was very simple on it unlike some of the other dishes which also made it easier for me to eat. ÊWasabi noodles a little overhyped for me. ÊLast, there was no letdown from the dessert of a bittersweet chocolate cake w/ the coffee ice cream. The only weird thing I noticed was they would keep filling our water glasses to 3/4 rather than all the way...seems like that guy knows the art of pretending to look busy.

I looove love love Asian Fusion and The House did not disappoint :) My boyfriend & I decided to have our "Valentine's Day" dinner here a week before the actual day to skip out on all the hoopla & crazy crowds. I'm glad we chose The House...the service was great, ambiance was nice & most importantly, the food was delicious. For our appetizer, we got the Oysters on the 1/2 shell with Thai salsa & for our entrees I ordered their signature Grilled Seabass and my boyfriend got one of the specials of the day: Braised Pork Shoulder with Foie Gras. The oysters were sooo fresh and the salsa complemented the dish well, it added a little spice which was nice. My Seabass was a pretty big portion and it came with sugar snap peas & homemade soy garlic noodles. Everything on the plate was delicious and the fish was perfectly cooked...like everyone on here says, it melted like buttaah! But the highlight of our visit was definitely my boyfriend's dish...I was soooo jealous! I kept on going back for more and more!! The pork had really great flavor, the foie gras was to diieee for and it was sitting in a KIMCHEE CURRY BROTH. Yessss, it was unbelievable! We also ordered a couple of Lychee Black Iced teas which were refreshing and tasty too. I can't wait till my next visit here! Next time I'm ordering dessert & I'll have my fingers crossed they'll still have that special dish my boyfriend ordered *drrroooool*.

Pomegranate Currant sauce where have you been all my life!!! I can't get over how amazing this place is. It is in the most unassuming place in SF, but so is a lot of amazing food in SF. Let's break it down... Service....Awesome. Everyone is super attentive and accommodating Ambiance...Relaxed but fun. This is the perfect place for a nice dinner with a date or a night out with some friends Price....Amazing. For the quality of the food and service I would easily pay 5 bucks more per dish. But I dont have to! Which is why this place would get 6 stars if it could. And finally the food...oh the food here. If anything in this world could be definitively labeled asian fusion it would be the food here. The food is smart and adventurous but has just enough familiar elements to make you feel comfortable. The ahi tartare and salmon egg rolls are amazing. The tuna is fresh as is it gets and the salmon in the egg rolls is perfectly fried leaving the center just slightly raw. And now to the star dish.... The Niman Ranch Kurobata Pork Chop with Pomegranate Currant Sauce. It's almost too good. Seriously. The pork chop is THE most tender, and flavorful pork chop you might ever have. EVER. It's how a pork chop should be. My mom, love you mom, made the driest pork chops known to man so I was pretty skeptical about having it. But man oh man was it worth the risk. The pomegranate currant sauce is THE best sauce I have had in my entire life. It's sweet, sour, savory, tangy, and has the smoothest finish of any sauce, anywhere. You could put it on a shoe and it would still be delicious. If there is one thing I want to achieve in my life in terms of culinary skill it is to make this sauce one day. So do you get the picture? COME HERE. Try this place out. You will not be disappointed. P.S. Parking is a biatch in SF so I usually park at the Powell Street garage and hoof my way around Chinatown, Union Square and whatnot

Decided to try this place from all the great yelp reviews. Holy delicious flavor town... We didn't have resos but they offered to take our cell # and called us within 10 minutes of putting our names down. Started with tasty oysters and seared scallops. I had the sea bass (how could I not after reading so many glowing reviews?), the boyf had the miso-glazed cod. both were really good, but i was happier with my sea bass + noodles and crunchy green beans. I would describe the flavors of this place as Asian for white people. All the stuff you know (lots of miso, soy, citrus and the like), and nothing too "adventurous". I've been told that's what "Asian Fusion" is supposed to mean but what do I know. When it's good, it's good!

Don't be fooled by the fresh modern interior and sleek decor, this place has been here 18 years! And for GREAT REASON! For appetizers, we ordered the Deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard, and the Asparagus with roasted sesame dressing. I typically don't like fried appetizers, but this one was great. The salmon was slightly cooked and only lightly fried, allowing you to taste more of the salmon than the fried shell. The Asparagus was sliced into bite size bits, with a pungent and tangy flavor.

Appetizers: Deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard, Ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips Entree: Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy Appetizers were decent but nothing to rave about. Not a fan of the ahi tuna tartare -- the wasabi aioli was overwhelming. Sea bass was grilled perfectly, but the sauce on the side was way too salty. Dip at your own risk.

Overhyped. We had dinner reservations on a Saturday night. We ordered: Tartare w. nori chips Mushroom & Prawn Risotto Chilean Sea Bass When I look back upon it (and my pictures), the risotto was really oily, and the chilean sea bass was really salty. The tartare appetizer was good, but it was kinda pricy for the amount you get. This place is really noisy, and AVOID getting the table at the very back (next to the kitchen door) at all cost!!! It is so dark there and especially noisy there because you can hear the clinkclanks of the dishes in the kitchen. They really need to install a light there. It was so uncomfortable to be eating in the dark. It is only when the waiters bust out of the kitchen door giving you a quick flash of light so you can actually see your food. Also, since the place is so busy it's hard to grab your waitress sometimes to just refill our water! Oh, and FYI, they do not do anything for birthdays, anniversaries, etc.

Having dined at numerous San Francisco restaurants, The House is my favorite! ÊThe restaurant is rated 26 on Zagat, but it really exceeded my expectation in every way. ÊNot knowing what to expect, we arrived on time for our reservation and were seated right away. Ê ÊMy first impression was that the restaurant was very small, very unassuming, and it was PACKED. Ê We had the crispy salmon roll and seared scallops as our appetizers, and seabass and the wasabi noodles steak as our entree. ÊSalmon rolls and scallops were to die for! Ê Sea bass was really good, but I've had better. ÊWasabi noodles was decent. ÊI would just go back for the scallops and crispy salmon rolls, and that's saying a lot since I usually wouldn't want to go back as a visitor. ÊAnd it's usually a good sign if I remember what I had since it's been a month since I've dined there. :) Ê Don't expect romantic ambiance or 5* service here. ÊBut they'll make it up with the food. :) ÊVery reasonably price, $100 for 2, and the food is much better than other highly rated SF restaurants on yelp.

A pleasant little surprise in North Beach... an area full of Italian food, late night drunk food that I usually partake in. I think I've walked by this place on numerous occasions not really knowing what was going on inside. It's small, and you'd miss it if you didn't know what you were looking at. I went in confused because I didn't know what the heck I was in for. To my delight, it was good food. Lots of that asian fusion that my friend was talking about. I was here for her birthday with another friend, and it was a nice little intimate place where we could enjoy our food and also hear each other talk at the same time. Everyone around us seemed to be enjoying themselves. It's a nice place, but at the same time it's pretty casual. So don't go in here thinking you have to spruce it up. But onto the more important stuff like the food... it was delicious! I loved the sea bass. It came with udon noodles and snow peas and the flavors were excellent. I didn't really like the sauce that came with it (it was a bit too salty and masked the sea bass flavor), but otherwise, I enjoyed it. We ordered mostly off the dinner menu, but we also enjoyed some of the specials of the day like the kobe beef with wasabi noodles. That was damn good. Also, nice presentation of the food all around, especially the ahi tuna tartare. It arrived looking like a spiral. It was cool. We also ordered three desserts each, but my favorite was the chocolate cake. My friend said there might have been some alcohol in it, but I think she was lying to me. Or maybe I was just in denial. All I tasted with chocolate and it was delicious. Can't wait to come back here in the future. There's so much more I want to try! Before arriving here, my friend and I stopped over at The Boardroom and the bartender Martin said it was the "Best kept secret in North Beach" and I must agree.

So I took my girlfriend here to celebrate V-day. The food was really good. I had a reservation at 9pm but was a little late so I called 30 minutes ahead of time and they said they would save the reservation if I came at 9:15pm. So I arrive at 9:10pm, and I had to hostess made me wait 35 minutes. I guess it was my fault for coming late? Anyways, hostess was very impersonal, almost borderline rude. But the waitress was friendly. The place was really really busy where the waiter to customer ratio is really high. The waitress came four times? 1) take our drink order 2) take our food order 3) give us our food 4) give us our check Considering I spent over $100 for two people, I expected better service. The food is really good though!!!!!!!!!! Food is awesome. Parking sucks. Service can be better Dessert sucks.

I didn't understand what "melt in your mouth" fish was until I came here. Now I do and I'm a better person for it. Cork fee was a decent $15 so we brought a bottle of white to compliment the fish; awesome choice. Everything about this place was awesome: service, food, dessert, service again. I'm amazed how quickly everything came out, but it didn't feel like they skipped on attention to detail. Leave it up to the asians to figure out efficiency (Toyota). Things ordered and would totally eat again: shashimi appetizer, deep fried salmon, black cod special, and sea bass. Dessert: coffee truffle chocolate goodness. Awesome. And the weird thing is, you're not stuffed after 2 appetizers, 2 entree, a dessert and a bottle of wine....you may be drunk though. Good stuff. Me gusta! I'm kind of excited to go back for steak, because that looked amazing, too!

The House is by far one of the best places I'd go to eat. I've gone here countless times - for both celebrations and casual dining. I love this place so much that I would recommend their entire menu. Not that I've had all of their dishes - I've probably tried anywhere between 25-50% of the menu, but everything looks very good and promising, and I've never had a dish that I did not like. They flavor everything very well and cook it to perfection. OH GOD I don't know what else to say about The House because I just rather fantasize about eating everything here again. They are SO cheap too, for the quality of the dishes they prepare. Very classy food at a low price! I've had the tuna tartare, fried calamari, crab cake, salmon roll, and pretty much most of their dinner entrees. My favorites are the wasabi house noodles with flatiron streak, but everything else is great, too. Their angus ribeye steak was one of the most AMAZING steak pieces I've had in my life, and the mashed potatoes under it were great too, but I wasn't that fond of the green vegetables under them, which were rather bland and unsavory. I wouldn't get it again for the price, as amazing as the steak itself was. But oh god their pork chop, chicken breasts, and everything else... TRY EVERYTHING, I have an obsession over coming here whenever I can to eat everything I can again. If you plan on coming at a non-weird hour, you probably should call for a reservation. Oh, and their kimchi slaw is amazing (they put it on a lot of dishes, like the wasabi house noodles, fried calamari, whatever as a side).

When I think "Asian Fusion", usually I get apprehensive about proceeding due to the glut of Roy's wannabes out there. However, numerous friends have defended and advocated for The House over the past few months, enough so that I put aside my prejudice in favor of some risk. And the risk was certainly worth it. Kurobuta pork chop = awesome. Ahi tuna = awesome. Crab cakes = awesome. Sea bass = awesome. Creme brulee = decent. Tapioca pudding = great. Ambience = quaint, but lively. Prices = excellent for the heapings you get. I'm not even going to say this is Asian Fusion. I'm going to say that it's damn good overall.

This is a great place to go on a date - if you don't mind it being a little loud. ÊIt was a really cute and quaint restaurant, very tiny.

Wasabi noodles were good, but I didnt taste any wasabi in them what so ever. 2) Mushroom rice with grilled prawns: This was amazing. Doesn't sound amazing but trust it was delicious. Rice was cooked really well and the sauce was very flavorful. Prawns were fresh. 3)Niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce: This dish was okay to me. ÊNothing spectacular. OH and for desert. ---creme brulee with this tangy mango sauce? it was amaaazing. Creme brulee had a great texture and the sauce on top had a nice kick to it.

Been here 3 times. ÊWas never impressed. My biggest critique here is the flavors really never quite worked for me.

ÊThe thick taste of cream prevented the strong flavor of sesame oil from leaving my palatte. ÊReally gross in my humble opinion. ÊAt best, if this combination could work, it's not my job to make it work is it? People all talk about the seabass here. ÊBut really, the sauce has been here for hundreds of years. ÊIt's just the same soy and ginger based sauce Chinese people use for steamed fish. ÊWhy is everyone raving about it? Seriously, if you want this type of food, please head to LA.

ÊI didn't like the deep-fried salmon roll at all even though it was Yelp recommended. ÊI thought the salmon was too dry and the sauce was way too wasabi-y. ÊI probably wouldn't ever get it again. Ê Parking is insane. ÊThere's a garage a few block down near Stockton that I would check out as a last resort. ÊI would ALWAYS make a reservation. ÊDisappointed that this place doesn't take reservations on http://OpenTable.com. ÊCalling to make a reservation is so outdated. Definitely would come back to try other Yelp recommended! Date of dining: July 7, 2011

The House has been on my list for a while since all of my Yelp friends have given it 5 stars. Maybe we were there on an off day, but if I wanted delicious Asian food with grumpy hurried service, I would've gone elsewhere in Chinatown with less dollar signs. ;) ÊDon't get me wrong, the food was tasty, but our non-smiling server rushing us out put a damper on dinner. Oh and they lost my reservation when I called a few days earlier to confirm. That didn't help. Food: Like I said, the food is yummy. In order of deliciousness - -Ribeye steak - My photo says it all. You can't go wrong with anything smothered in garlic butter. Perfectly cooked, beautiful marbling, amazing teriyaki sauce. -Kobe steak with chanterelle mushrooms - Well cooked, incredibly tender steak. Chanterelle mushrooms and sauce were perfect. -Unagi with avocado sushi rice - Unagi was melt in your mouth delicious. Avocado sushi rice was interesting. -Apple crumble - Warm apple center, crunchy crust, vanilla ice cream. Pretty good, but didn't blow me away. -Calamari - Crispy and tasty, but nothing special. -Wasabi noodles - Steak was juicy and tender. Noodles were bland. Wasabi was not overwhelming. Dish did not mesh well together. -Chocolate cake with espresso ice cream - Exactly what it sounds like. Average. Atmosphere: Felt small, crowded, and loud. They stuck our big party in the corner of the restaurant near the entrance so everyone Êwaiting for a table was rubbing against our backs. Parking: Parking is a pain in North Beach but there are several garages nearby. Reservations: Each reservation is only 1.5 hours so if you make a reso at 7:30pm, you have to get out at 9pm. Doesn't make for a very leisurely dinner. ;)

My first time at The House, I was told the Grilled Sea Bass with Garlic Ginger Soy is their standout dish so it was a no-brainer as to my entree selection being the seafood lover that I am. It was wooonderful! The sea bass was grilled to perfection and it had a soft, buttery texture. The fish was accompanied by a side of noodles and green beans. There is already a lot of flavor to the fish but you can add more of the ginger garlic soy. The Tuna Tartare appetizer was also delicious. That was over a year ago but I've been back recently and the grilled sea bass is just as great as I remembered it to be. For the appetizer this time, we had the seared foie. It had a nice sear on the outside and the softness inside just melted in my mouth. It was served on iceberg lettuce with a vinaigrette which worked really well to balance the richness of the foie. So simple yet so good.

We were able to snag last minute reservations to The House. We had reservations at 6pm but unfortunately due to the weather we were late 20 minutes so the waitress advised us that she had given our table away and that it would be a 20 minute wait. Strangely, after she said that, she pointed to a table for us to be seated at. Nice! We ordered the cod and the sea bass. Both dishes were delicious! So tender and flaky. I love fish like that! Nice and fresh! ÊFor dessert we got the apple cobbler ala mode. ÊIt was only okay. ÊNothing outstanding. ÊTowards the end we felt really rushed to leave the restaurant because they started clearing out table. ÊNot the best way to end a dinner but we understood since there were people waiting to be seated and we were late.

EVERYTHING, and I do mean EVERYTHING here is amazing. It's hard to believe that this San Francisco hot spot is a family run operation. Just order whatever catches your fancy, and you really can't go wrong. I brought my mom and brother here when I went back to the Bay to visit and my brother said that it was the best restaurant he's ever been to. The food and the service were both impeccable. Truly one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had! Just make sure you make a reservation, because as you can see by the reviews, this place is POPULAR. Also, make the appropriate travel arrangements because there isn't much parking nearby and the small valet lot down the street tends to fill up fast. If you don't mind the walk (and mind you, after this delectable meal, Êyou'll probably need the exercise anyways) it's only about a 15-20 minute stroll from the Union Station BART stop.

1. BBQ oysters with spicy cilantro mignonette. 5/5 good fresh oysters with the refreshing element of cilantro. 2. wasabi noodles with flatiron steak. 5/5 noodles just as good as everyone says they are. Definitely order some. Steak was a backseat driver here. 3. kurobuta pork chop 4/5. A little on the dry side. but still goof flavor. 4. Mango Tapioca 5/5. Well presented with heart shapes in it. Really yummy as well. 5. creme brulee. 2/5. definitely not my favorite.

This review is long overdue, as The House has been one of my favorite restaurants for over a year now. ÊThe food simply has to be tried. They get flavors just right, and everything has a unique feel to it, and at the same time it is hard to describe. I normally start out with "It's Asian-Fusion, but really different from any Asian-Fusion you have tried..." whenever I try to explain it My favorite is definitely the grilled eel over avocado infused rice, the must-have appetizer - 5 stars The wasabi steak noodles - 4 starts. Cutting out one star only because once in a while the meat is a bit too stringy and too tough, so it's hit or miss (3 or 5 depending on the source that day) The sea bass - 5 stars - great flavor in the noodles and the sauce to balance the white, delicate meat of the fish I took my Romanian, completely unadventurous in terms of food mother when she came to visit from the motherland and she tried it all out and loved it, so definitely one of the restaurants I would pick to convert a new foodie :) Ê One word of warning: The House is the only place in my 3.5 years in San Francisco where I showed up w/o a rez on a Tuesday and the wait was 1 hour.

The House has never let me down. I used to eat at the Judah location all the time before they shut down. For this location, it's a bit of a pain for parking at times. Their special menus are always good. The chilean sea bass or now it's probably just plain bass now... is spot on. Love their Cal-Asian fusion. Family owned

I'm usually hesitant to try new-fangled fusion places that are hyped up but The House definitely exceeded my expectations. The salmon rolls were delicious and my favorite out of the appetizers that we ordered. The center is still slightly raw so it doesn't have that overcooked salmon flavor. The outside is crispy and the sauce is pleasantly tingly with wasabi. The ahi tartare however was fresh but forgettable and served in a tiny portion. The asparagus appetizer was light and crunchy. Everything was perfectly seasoned with an Asian flair. For my entree I went with the kobe special of the day which was friggin AMAZING. I'm still not over it and it's been practically a month now. The beef was thinly sliced and cooked perfectly medium. It was topped with mushrooms and cherry tomatoes on a bed of cauliflower and mashed potatoes. The cauliflower soaked up the amazing sauce and was surprisingly a huge highlight of the dish. I also tried my friend's sea bass which was flaky and buttery and came with a tangy sauce. But I'm more of a turf than surf person so the kobe still wins in my eyes. The portions are perfectly filling. The litchi iced tea was quite refreshing as well. The tea comes unsweetened and though they give you sugar on the side it's really not needed. I can't wait to come back!

Haven't found a place in the city where I left with an amazement on how inventive and mind-blowing the food was... until I found The House. Using Yelp, I was on a search for the best Asian-fusion joint (or at least one with the highest Yelp ratings) in the city. Low and behold, with 1,757 reviews and still maintaining a 4 1/2 star rating definitely warranted a visit from my partner and I. After eating here, it definitely hits the mark on the 4 1/2... and I shall explain why.... We made a reservation over the phone and was surprised to able to snag a table for two for the next day at 7pm. On a Thursday night in the city, I didn't expect this place (with it's small dining area size and popularity) to have one. Nonetheless, we got lucky. Finding the place isn't too hard. Parking is a different story, especially in the middle of the dinner rush on a Thurs night. We circled Columbus, Grant and every alley at least three times for an empty (aka free after 6pm) spot, to no avail. We eventually settled for the North Beach Garage on Vallejo St ($3/hr isn't too shabby). Walking in, I was surprised as to how small the actual dining space was. By scanning the room, I could see why the fire marshal would have given the eye if more than 35 people (including waiters) had been seated in that space. I was happily surprised to with diversity of the people in the place. I overheard from the group of two couples, seated beside us, in their mid-50s talking about how they found this gem on Yelp. Each new dish that we'd ordered, sharply caught their eyes as they followed the traveling dish onto our table. Immediately they'd talk about the dish and decide whether to order it or not. The menu read like a standard asian fusion restaurant with the typical meats: oysters, ahi tuna, shrimp, salmon, steak, prawns, sea bass, ribeye. How it was cooked AND presented was a different story. We Êordered: H'ordeuvres (from the small plate section): Deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard Blue lake bean tempura with pickled ginger soy Entrees: Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy Miso-glazed black cod From the starters to the main meals, the presentation was eye-catching and delightfully interesting. I especially loved the fried salmon roll. Crunchy on the outside and so tender on the inside. The flavors were amazing (imagine 4th of July fireworks in your mouth) and had a fine dining type of presentation. The true highlight, however, was the sea bass. My partner had described it so perfectly, "grilled perfectly like a steak." One bite and I knew that it had to be marinated in butter because sea bass CANNOT be that ridiculously juicy and oh so tender in the mouth! Because we'd eaten enough fried food that day (and week) to be admitted in the ER for chest pains, we opted out of dessert. All in all, it was a fantastic meal. They would have gotten a 5-star rating, had it not been for their 3-star service. We had to waive for the waitress' attention not once, twice, or three... but FOUR times. And when I got her attention, she replied with the very stern, "just wait." That had cost her at least 5% minus off the gratuity. The service, overall, rivaled that of In-N-Out Burger or another fast food joint. I blame it on the high popularity of the place, coupled with the very limited seating. We left with a 10% tip and the total cost was still $86. Anything less than $100 is decently priced in our book. DEFINITELY coming back... as early as tomorrow.

This place is amazing. I've been here 3 times and I have no complaints. I also took an old friend here while he was visiting from LA. ÊHe is a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu Pasadena. He also had a great experience. A few things: 1. The food is fresh and each core entrŽe item has 2 complimentary sides included on the plate that serve your taste buds well. For the foodies, I suggest tasting each item individually then all three together. ÊThe individual taste and the blended taste are so different, but it's a great experience to say the least. 2. The presentation of the food is pretty amazing. It not only taste fabulous, it's food art in my eyes. Ê 3. Another great "date" spot. 4. The menu is small and controlled. The chefs know what they are doing and have mastered the menu. Since the menu is small and mastered, you are going to get a good meal out of this place no matter what you order. 5. The space is very intimate, so if you are not a fan of tight seating, then I highly suggest getting over your phobia. The food is worth a visit. My only suggestion: Make reservations and don't be late. If you are running late, call in advanced. They are pretty accommodating. ÊThis place is always crowded hence the location and the quality of food. At least on the weekends. Ê Enjoy.

Came here once and have been dreaming about coming here again. *People are not exaggerating when they say this place is small...call for a reservation, you will thank yourself later *Tried the SEA BASS and POMEGRANATE PORK --both were so good that it will be really hard for me to try something new on my next visit. ÊOne review stated that their food was a bit salty but I didn't find that to be true on my visit (and I have a sensitive salt sensor...really I do).

Just came back from eating at The House. My first tip is be sure to make a reservation if you plan on eating here after 7PM. This place gets packed! Even on a Tuesday. We started off the meal with an appetizer, the edamame tempura which came with a ginger dip which complimented the tempura flavor nicely. My friend ordered the special: Cod with miso (I think) and 2 long California rolls. I ordered the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. I LOVED my friend's dish way better than the sea bass. The sea bass was just ok. Nothing special. It didn't melt and fall apart in my mouth like I expected it to. The sea bass was blackened so perhaps this is why the fish tasted drier than usual. Also the sea bass came with a side of noodles drenched in soy sauce and garlic as well as a pile of green beans drenched in the same sauce. The green beans were pretty hard so didn't really enjoy those. The cod was delicious! I highly recommend. I didn't get to taste her California roll, but it looked pretty damn good too. Let's just say, her plate was wiped clean, one step away from being licked. I'm giving The House 4 stars because this is my third time here and I have never been disappointed with my food until this time so I'm sure it was just a fluke. I would definitely come back....and order the cod next time!

WOW. Me and friends came here and we started off with the steamed mussles. They were pretty darn good! So good that Julie B. slurped up all the broth in the end. We all ordered different things. No need to go through each one since everything was DEEELICIOUS! I don't think you can go wrong with ordering any particular dish. I can say that the sea bass was to die for! It was so soft... melted in my mouth and the sauce was perfect. I am definitely coming again! The only bad thing is that the restaurant is small, so large groups wouldn't fit so well, but our group of 5 fit alright. It was weird that they sat us in a little corner table with one of us sitting in the walkway when they had booth tables that we could sit at to span two tables.

We had a large party of 16 people, and we managed to snag a 5:30pm reservation for a Sunday night. The service was friendly and non-intrusive, and the interior of the small restaurant was very cozy. I don't know what I was expecting of this place, but I left feeling satisfied with my meal. My table ordered a couple of appetizers to share. I really liked the unagi over sushi rice - super delicious. We also loved the bean tempura, which was also "easy to share" as the waitress promised. The salmon rolls were good, too, and the red onion salad at the bottom of those rolls had quite a wasabi kick. Yum! For my entree, I ordered the wasabi noodles with steak. Delicious! But I have to admit, the star of the evening was the kurobuta pork with fois gras in a miso broth. It was on their special menu. Wow, that was some seriously good pork. Super tender but with a nice charred/crisp crust to it... Divine! I have to come back and try out some of the other dishes. They all looked so intriguing! One downside is that it's located in a pretty busy neighborhood. Parking is difficult, so be sure to add 15-20 min to your travel time.

I recall getting the seabass and it was quite delicious! I had come here totally blinded, considering I had never even heard of the place before. The location is kind of weird considering they serve asian fusion but are in the heart of North Beach. The decor was really modern but the atmosphere was kind of busy. Even with reservations, they seem to want to shoo you out to get ready for their next reservations. We had come in about 15 minutes late and the attendee was sort of a stickler for time, saying that we'll have to hurry with our food. Although in the end, the waitresses were pretty nice and I didn't feel rushed at all. I wouldn't say this is a great place for a first date, as you can't really take your time. Other than that, great food, great ambience, and great location. I'll more than likely be back!

I'm not a big fan of Asian Fusion which shouldn't come as a big surprise to most of you who read my reviews. The House is one of my few rare exceptions. It is the perfect example of how Asian Fusion is done right. Had my first meal here over five years ago and every time thereafter has been nothing less than fantastic. My picks from the menu: Ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips. Maine crab cake with pickled ginger remoulade. Warm wasabi house noodles. Sometimes they have the black cod special and it's a must when they do. And of course, grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy, the shiny star of the menu. Buttery, flaky sea bass grilled to perfection. This one blows every other dish on the menu out of the water. All this comes from a person who have a great dislike for Asian Fusion.

Small little gem of a restaurant! Fabulous food and quick service. If you don't mind the crowded space, definitely come here for an excellent meal that isn't too pricey.

4.5 stars This has got to be one of my all time FAVORITE places for Asian Fusion Cuisine in SF- defined in 2 words: simplicity and perfection (ok, almost perfect!) I've tried practically everything on the menu. ÊMy advice is to get any fish entree, you can never go wrong! ÊI am a HUGE fan of the SEA BASS!! ÊYou put it in your mouth and you're like O M G!! The fish is simply packed with massive flavor, rich and light at the same time, just soooo DELICIOUS! Oh, and I also want to mention this place is reasonably priced, won't burn a hole in your pocket. A good comparable restaurant is Chaya Brasserie (which i also like) without the hefty price tag. WOOT GOOT! =) Minus 1/2 a star for this disappointing item: The deep-fried chicken liver with baby greens- which was still raw in the middle and a big NO NO in my books!! We had to send it back! =( *Make sure to reserve a table, this place is TINY!!

Heard about "The House" through a co-worker, then found it on Yelp! ÊI made a reservation, which was key, because even though it was Wednesday night, the place was packed. ÊI was annoyed that their online menu didn't contain prices, but appetizers are $6-$11 and mains are $16-$25. I had a seared scallop appetizer, which was delicious, and the miso black cod with California roll. ÊThe cod was incredibly buttery and delicious; the California roll was good but felt out of place with the cod. ÊThat said, I was scooping up every last drop of the sauce with my fork. My friend had a grilled calamari with bonito shavings -- and when they set his plate down, the bonito shavings were wiggling around as they radiated heat from the oven. ÊThe effect was that his appetizer was still alive, which was both bizarre and awesome. Portions are a little on the small side, but not terrible for the price and quality. For dessert, I had the chocolate cake with ice cream; good but not decadent.

today's highlight was their special dish Pork belly udon noodle with spivey miso soup broth. everything was spot on. delicious. for the fried chicken sandwich, it was very good but I have had a better one at Seoul Patch. the mussel steamer was very good but I wish it had come with some bread because the broth was very good. another special dish, papaya kobe beef salad missed a spot. every ingredient was well-cooked but it was missing something, like contrast among flavors. overall, it was a pleasant experience, but it didn't quite blow us away. i would give 4 stars if it were more reasonably priced.

The chefs (or chef?) at the House make awesome food - consistently! The sea bass is amaaazing- buttery flakey fish with fat garlicy noodles and fresh crisp green beans all with an amazing piquant soy/garlic something-i-don't-even-know-but-i-love it-sauce - holy cow!! that and everything else we try is always flavorful, thoughtfully presented and fresh - impressive! Yes, it's cramped and awkward with the waiting, people 'leering at you while they're waiting' aspect ect, but if you don't want to deal with the crowd and all of that nonsense and need to get your delicious food fix, go early or late, or for lunch - ta da! always good!

After the four of us struggled with getting enough coins to fill the parking meter, we sat down for a nice lunch at The House. ÊI liked the feet paintings that were on the wall, and I liked our waitress who resembled Vera Wang. Ê Deep-fried chicken liver with baby greens- everyone at the table seemed to enjoy this but me...meh. Wasabi house noodles- Hella Good. ÊIt took a few bites to really taste the wasabi flavor over the teriyaki-ish sauce. ÊI loved the cole slaw-kim chi pile of cabbage on top. Curry noodles- tried a bite and it was very tasty. ÊYou can't really go wrong with curry. We were full from our meals and were in a bit of a rush so we didn't get dessert, but after hearing from a friend that they have excellent passion fruit crme brulee, I sorta, kinda, maybe wish we tried it.

Went for lunch and decided on the flank steak entree. Delicious! The meat was very tender, the sauce was scumptious and the mushrooms they put on top were full of flavor. The price also wasn't as bad as I was expecting. My dish was $15 but there were many that were less than that. The most expensive entree was $23 for the sea bass (which my friend said was also very good). This restaurant is the closet I've come to wanting to give 5 stars. If the quality is still amazing after another visit I will definitely have to elevate it.

Given the ridiculously good reviews, these guys have the right to be very stuffy and pricey. Fortunately, they are not - the hostess was very sweet and welcoming, and the prices reasonable. The sea bass is as awesome as they say. Simple, great place.

After several trips to San Francisco, my wife and I were looking for something new and different. thanks to a niece who has friends in the area The House was suggested. What a stroke of luck! From a reasonable one hour wait for walk in seating to the heavenly sea bass everything was perfect. Oh did I mention the sea bass? Seared scallops were done just right and sashimi tuna was superb. As other yelpers have mentioned the sea bass had just the right amount of crunch to go with a perfectly done center. Asian noodles to make the An family jealous! We will go back!

I've been here twice. Both times, needed a reservation because the establishment is small and always busy. We started off with the kobe beef tartare which was incredible. Served on top of a crispy piece of toast, the beef was delicious and tender. ÊThe grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy is also amazing! The sea bass melts in your mouth and the garlic noodles and sauteed green beans are great sides. I can't wait to go back the next time i'm in the area.

A very trendy city guy told me about this restaurant. He said "the house is my favorite restaurant right now". And I thought this was some new fusion joint. When i finally got around to going, I asked the friendly waitress how long they've been around. ÊThey've been around for years! Like a decade! But the decor is modern and the menu is interesting. I noticed a lot of yelpers tried the large sushi roll dish, but I didn't notice it on the menu. ÊAlthough, I saw it come out to a different table while I was dining there --- food envy! The food we DID order was pretty good. ÊWe tried a deep-fried chicken liver with greens. ÊI like liver and I like deep fried food so this was enjoyable... but it wasn't anything to RAVE about. The curry noodles were delicious - the curry was flavorful, the veggies also absorbed a lot of the flavor and added texture to this dish. ÊThe noodles combined with the sauce was an ideal comfort food dish, especially on a gloomy day! This would be a great spot for a date or for a casual get-together!

So this was a special post dinner for us and the wait was expected to be 45mins to an hour without reservations. We didn't mind of course. We ordered a bottle of champange rose to quench our thirst. For appetizers, we ordered raw oysters on the half shells, fried calamari, seared scallops, and the unagi roll. For the main dish, we shared the wasabi noodle. We didn't order dessert because we were too full. The food was AMAZING... Every single bite i had was so delish and it all just made me say mhmmmmmm!!! LoL

I feel like when a restaurant on Yelp is rated as high as this one, people don't read the reviews that are 4-5 stars. Instead they seek out the 1-2 stars to scope out negative aspects. Anyways, I came here on a saturday night for a dinner date with my girlfriend. With our fancy pants on, we got to the restaurant at 8pm for 8:30 reservations, and were seated immediately. Pretty awesome. -Instead of bread, they gave us pickled asian cucumbers. I liked it but I think I would have appreciated the bread to sop up the garlic ginger soy sauce mentioned below. -The jasmine tea was fragrant and light. Actually, I'm stealing those adjectives from the menu. But they rang true. -The deep fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard was SO GOOD. Mustard was more watery that I expected but it was delicious. It goes straight to your sinuses. The coleslaw was really good too. -The wasabi noodles and flat iron steak wasn't as good as I expected. The noodles were a little bland, weren't as spicy as I hoped. It was still better than average though. -The grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy noodles were great. I really liked the sauce on the noodles. The fish was flakey and perfectly cooked. The funny thing is the food at The House could be seen in an average chinese restaurant. But the execution of the dishes are really well done. So much so that the upscale prices are justified. Two people, one appetizer, one drink, two entrees for around $70 tax and tip included. One complaint. The place is so small, it gets so loud. I had to talk over the people sitting at the next table. They should put shag on the walls to absorb the sound. Works in vans and old people's houses. Why not House? Oh and MAKE RESERVATIONS.

This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the city! ÊI have never had anything that is not delicious!! The fried salmon roll with spicy mustard appetizer is perfectly cooked and has a spicy wasabi mustard to compliment. ÊThe prices are a little high, but they give you nice portions, you will leave feeling full. ÊMake a reservation, especially if you have a larger party.

My friends and I were lucky and came right before the lunch rush, so we were seated right away even though we were a party of 6. What we ordered: Deep Fried Salmon Rolls - so tasty!!! I was a little scared to eat it because the salmon itself isn't cooked all the way and there's a little bit of pink in the center. It tasted way better than I expected. I'm not a fan of the hot mustard dipping sauce though. But that's just because I hate Chinese hot mustard/horseradish/wasabi. Chipotle Pork Sandwich - this was very flavorful and kinda tasted like korean bbq pork. My only gripe with this dish was the fact that there were some nice chunks of fat that I had to spit out. The salad that accompanies the sandwich was dressed very lightly with a sesame dressing that was really good. Curry noodles - the few bites that I had from my friend's dish was very tasty. However, eating a whole dish of curry noodles can be overwhelming and you'll get sick of it fast. Definitely a sharing dish just to try. Korean short rips - omg the marinaded short ribs were so good! Cooked perfectly with potatoes and sauteed green beans. This is definitely a safe dish to try for the unadventurous. Sea Bass - I didn't try the sea bass personally, but everyone else at the table raved about it and said it was the best dish that we ordered at the table. I'm not huge on fish so I didn't try it. The noodles that came with it was VERY good. Mango tapioca - very creamy and not too sweet or rich. I liked this a lot and we scraped the bowl clean Pecan pumpkin pie - eh. I can pass on this one. Overall, the service was attentive and friendly. I really enjoyed my time here and was glad to try it. I'll definitely be back here again!

I've been here 4 times now and have been impressed every time. Every time my girlfriend makes the long trip over from Madrid, this is the first place she wants to go eat. She's even called this her "favorite restaurant in the world, I think". Big words, I know. But believe me that even if it can't quite live up to that claim in your book you will most certainly be impressed with the extremely high quality seafood and creative of Asian fusion menu. This is one of the only restaurants where I pay very close attention to the specials because the Pork shoulder with foie gras and the Cod special are absolutely amazing (no hyperbole here). Another tip is the Japanese Rice beer, both of which are very good. Oh, and of course you must never skip the fried salmon appetizer, even if you're on a budget. Even if The House wasn't around the corner from my place I would still endure the endless wait, the annoying door that doesn't close by itself (you'll know what I mean), and the lack of parking, just to enjoy this fantastic and unique food. Try it, or go back if you haven't had the pork shoulder!

Dined here with a group of 12 on New Years Eve and everything worked out perfectly without a hitch. ÊEverything on the menu looked fantastic, especially if you were a seafood lover. Ê Not many options if you are not (i.e. my husband) but he was quite happy with his steak entree. Ê All entrees have the option to add fois grois for an additional $8. From my side of the table, we ordered: deep fried salmon rolls with chinese hot mustard - the mustard has a HUGE kick and it was not as greasy as I had expected. oysters - AWESOME Scallops with creamy orzo Steak entree with mashed potatoes and vegetables the grilled scallops were very very good and paired well with the creamy orzo. Exceptional and fast service, especially with a "full house" on NYE night. ÊTheir waitresses really are on top of everything which is super important on a special night. The only (very small) disappointment for me was the dessert menu. ÊNothing on the menu appealed to me as there were only 3-4 items to choose from. Small restaurant so definitely make reservations in advance.

I was quite surprised at how disappointing the meal was at the house. We made reservations but waited a good 20 minutes for our table,which would be ok if it was not such a tiny place and i felt like I was hovering over people who were trying to enjoy their meal. The appetisers were good but the main courses were disappointing. We tried: Salmon roll - pretty good, nice crispy springroll skin, nori and medium cooked salmon. went with the sauce really well Ahi tuna tartare - the nori chips were grossly oily, and the tuna looked grey and unappealing - tasted primarily of wasabi n not much else Unagi on Avocado rice - very very good. the unagi was thick & juicy with a great creamy well cooked rice mixed w avocado Wasabi noodles & angus flat iron steak - noodles were ok, great texture not so great flavours but the steak was abysmal. cooked to the right temperature but tough beyond beliefe Angus ribeye - same issue as the flat iron - so tough i had problems cutting through the meat and we barely made it halfway through. Mash potatoes were ok but we left most of it behind. Mushroom rice & shrimp - pretty good. The mushroom rice had so much flavour and was cooked a little on the al dente side. shrimps were grilled well. Sea bass - fish was amazing, cooked well and went well w the soy sauce. Veges and noodles were extremely oily... The service was quite absent - no one checked on how the food was till halfway through.By dessert, we just want to head over to steps of rome for a better experience.

Consistent is probably the best way to describe this place. I've been ordering Êlunch here about once a week for the last 4 months. When the project team asks "where are we going for lunch?" and no one can come up with a good response, the default is The House. Lunch: The Wasabi Noodles w/ Salmon, the Seabass, Udon noodle soup and Tempura Beans are all off the charts amazing. The grilled salmon and pork sandwich are also good choices. Bottom line is that there's not a bad item on the menu and they consistently deliver week in and week out. Possibly some of the best food in the city.

Top. Shelf. I can't wait to get back to The House. Let's dive right in! Per my usual review M.O. the lady and I went here on a date night. We Muni'd in and walked up to place our names on the already bustling guest list. They said it'd be about 30 minutes and so we decided to head and get a drink at Comstock. Exactly 30 minutes later they called us and we headed to dinner. The place is...cozy. Ha! It's a bit cramped but it's really the acceptable level of cramped that emits more of a homey vibe than a claustrophobic one. The lighting was low and the ambiance was kinetic and cheerful. The kind of lighting that lends itself to both romantic/seculded and downtown drinks. The hostess was polite but not Mary Poppins and the wait staff was amiable, helpful and attentive. But not in your face, 86 pieces of flare attentive. I hate it when they linger. This brings me to the food: UN. REAL. We started with a soft-shell crab appetizer that was just perfectly deep fried. Not heavy and a light golden brown that was both succulent and slightly briny. My girlfriend got the mushroom risotto with grilled prawns that was teeming with flavor and I got the niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce. HOLY CRAP! This was perhaps the best meal I have ever had the good graces to taste. The pork chop was expertly cooked, bursting with flavor and not the least bit dry. The currant sauce was a devilish pairing and the sweet potato puree that accompanied was a delight! I will absolutely be going here again. Thus far my favorite meal in the city!!!

Had dinner here for nye- didn't really expect it to live up to the hype but it did. Very crowded but it was a holiday. We had 8pm reservations and were seated right on time. Not the most romantic atmosphere since you sit so close to the other guests but it wasn't a huge issue. Our waitress was efficient but nice. We had the salmon roll which was good but not amazing.

We wandered into this place because it was raining and it had great yelp reviews. ÊWe didn't realize you usually need a reservation to get a seat, but the waitress was accommodating and said if our party of 4 could eat in about an hour, she could seat us immediately. The atmosphere was great; it is a small place with limited seats so it was never too loud. Food was definitely expensive, and you don't get much volume. Tasted great, but nothing especially impressive. ÊWorth trying once, but I wouldn't frequent it due to price and the need to get reservations.

I was close to giving them four stars for such a small place, but it isn't their fault! I would've never thought The House would be on such a small one way street in North Beach when the inside makes it look like a place you'd go to in the Embarcaderro or somewhere in Marina district. Definitely great service. It sucks to wait with a large party or when you dont have a reservation too. Their sea bass is REALLY GOOD. I usually don't order fish at restaurants, but this sh*t was awesome. My buddy had some Kobe NY steak, and it was cooked perfectly. It was the special for the night and It was one of the best pieces of steak I've ever had, I think even better than house of prime rib status though. Their decor and feel in here is pretty nice, something you'd be able to take a girl out on a date to. Prices are not bad at all either especially for the quality of food you get. I hope you guys find a bigger place or atleast open another one in San Francisco, I'd be there more often since parking is so difficult in North Beach

This restaurant is small, trendy, and is always packed! I'm glad that reservations were made that night. This was my first experience eating at an Asian Fusion restaurant. -Side: small plate of pickled cucumbers & roasted sesame seeds. They were so small and cute! They were definitely not sour at all. -Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak: the noodles were a little salty and the steak wasn't overcooked. -Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy: the fish was finely cooked and melted in my mouth. The noodles were a bit salty too. The environment was dimly lit, a bit noisy, but I still felt comfortable. I thought that the food overall was a bit salty to my taste, but I feel that it was attributed to the "Fusion-ness." Their menu has so much more to offer and this was a good Fusion experience overall :)

I was an AsianFusion hater. I thought AF is half ass banana type of thing. I don't know why but after i got divorced, I should know better, it was nothing to do with her race but I was thinking such like below. "What a dumb ass i was. married to White woman was a mistake! I should marry to my own people! " "Mix marriage is bullshit." "A White man who married to an Asian woman because small penis." "Or An Asian woman who married to a white man because her vagina is big as a house." "Mix marriage is like eating Natto with sourdough bread." etcetera. it was my dark time. I couldn't even watch a porn that Asian girls Fxxxin' white men. I was married for 10 years. I have 2 boys and they are so called "Hapa". Half Asian and Half White. I have to admit that they were the only "Half thing" I liked at that moment of my dark era. I think I was a bit mentally sick man. I didn't like anything "half and half" or "mixed things" because of my divorce. I stopped taking half and half for my coffee. I stopped buying oreo cookies. I stopped liking "It's it ". I tried not eatin' S'mores. And, I went on to dislike "Light thing" too. Spam light Marlboro light ( Yes, I used to smoke) Light Mayo Light Soy sauce. I didn't like anything "between". It gotto be black or white. It gotto be 100% or Zero. Now I know it wasn't her, but at that time, I think I was looking for who I really was. It took me for a while to recover. But, there were 4 things I didn't do such as below: Take drug. Drink alcohol. See psychiatrist. Go to church. I didn't do any of them. Instead, I read books to recover myself. I was reading like son of a bitch. Anyway. I got a phone call from my friend the other day sayin', " Hey Nobu, we are in town, Are you coming for dinner tonight?" I said, "What? Tonight? Where to?" He replied, "The House on Grand Avenue. It's a Asian Fusion. I know you don't do AF but, it's still open if you have any other suggestion." I said, "AsianFusion Huh? ............. Ok." Reason why I said OK only because he drove up here from LA the day and I totally forgot about he was coming. I was thinking like, "SonofaBitch! AsianFusion? WhattheFXXX?" My GF was checkin' the place on Yelp, and said, "Heyheyhey! Looks pretty good. 4.5 stars!" When we got there 6:20 nice Sunday evening, Thank God he made reservation, it was a full house. We shared: Ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips Deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard My GF had: Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak $17 I had: Grilled black cod with garlic ginger soy $24 This place is my first Asian Fusion experience. I have to say, it was phenomenal. Even though i was very skeptical when I saw the Warm wasabi house noodles on the menu. It was Udon noodle, al dente, a bit Wasabi flavor, ummmmmmm, it was good. I like the Food, the Service was good, Nice decor. But the uni-sex rest room needs little help to get 5 star. So, 4 star for now. I like the Asian Fusion. AF is not bad at all. Mixed is OK. I don't mind Mixed thing, at all. We'll be back. I still hate light things though, Spam light, Light Mayo and Light Soy sauce. I hate them! About my Mix marriage, It didn't work because she was white? No, Hell No! it was just a miss-match. There was nothing to do with her race, period.

I was just reminded last night of how delicious the food is at The House. I'm gonna keep this brief since there are 980 reviews on this tiny Asian Fusion eatery already, plus this is my second update. Ok, listen up: If they offer the miso black cod as a special, you MUST order it. It's fan-freakin-tastic! The sea bass is also amazing, but the cod melts in your mouth. It's so buttery soft. Also, if they offer the seared scallops as a special appetizer, that's not to be missed either. For dessert, get the chocolate cake. Trust me, order these dishes and you'll be guaranteed a 5 star dining experience. Oh, and make reservations, because this place is as big as your closet.

Too Legit to quit. This House is small, compact and straight to the point, which is bountiful flavors infused into their food. In the asian fusion category this is number 1 on my list and the gap between one and two is extraordinary. I would definitely recommend making reservations. On to where it counts the food: Deep Fried Salmon roll with chinese hot mustard: To be perfectly honest I was really looking forward to being impressed with this appetizer, but I wasn't. It's their most popular starter. My salmon was more on the dry side which is perfectly normal considering it was fried. oh well, can't win them all I suppose. Grilled Sea Bass with garlic ginger soy!!!!: The sea bass is melt in your mouth goodness. It comes with a side of green beans and garlic noodles. A harmonious pairing. ÊMust order! Angus Ribeye: Delectable. The housemade teriyaki sauce was not overpowering and melded well into the meat. Great sear on the meat and tender. Ordered one of their specials, which I can't seem to fully recall. It was veal? It's been a while so my memory is failing me, but I distinctly have the feeling of satisfaction whatever the dish was haha. Good enough =) In a nut shell, it's one of my favorites in the city. It beats out Frascati, Firefly, and a couple more neighborhoody restaurants! Those places are nothing to scoff at either.

Definitely go to the House. BUT do not go to the House on a diet. You will likely order an appetizer, eat the entire delicious item, order a main, eat it all and then lick the plate (lick your friend's plate too!), and then be tempted into ordering a dessert (the chocolate truffle with coffee ice cream, coconut, and caramel sauce was great!). I observed at my dinner tonight that rarely a bite goes uneaten at the House. My dad had the signature sea bass and the four men at the table next to us then all ordered the sea bass (we teased them for that!). I had the special yellowtail with a california roll on top and my mom and I split the sesame asparagus to start. My mom had the salmon and I spooned up every last spoonful of the yummy sauce/broth... The House again delivers something much better than I could cook at my House!

I heard so much about how good the food was at The House, so I had to finally try it for myself. ÊI needed to pick up something from my friend, so we decided to grab dinner as well. ÊWe were able to get reservations easily on a Wednesday night. ÊParking was a breeze, too. ÊWe found a spot 2 blocks up and didn't even have to circle around. We started off with scallops as our appetizer, I got the Grilled Sea Bass with Garlic Ginger Soy, my friend got the Kurobuta Pork Chop with Pomegranate Currant Sauce, and we finished off with a Coconut Creme Brulee with Passion fruit Puree. The scallops were very good. ÊPerfectly seared on the outside and still nice and tender inside. ÊMy sea bass was awesome. ÊI really liked the garlic ginger soy dipping sauce. ÊAnd the sweat peas that came with it were nice and crispy. ÊMy friend kept ranting and raving about how good the pork chop was, so I had a bite. And yes...it really was that good. ÊThe pomegranate currant sauce gave the pork a sweet glaze, and it was nice and moist on the inside. ÊThe passion fruit puree on the creme brulee shocked me with its tartness. ÊBut after I got over that, it went quite well with the coconut flavor of the creme brulee. Ê Our waitress gave us good service. ÊWe were seated at the farthest possible table by the window, but we were still checked on regularly. ÊOur water glasses were always filled and our food came out quickly. This is a very small place, so make sure you get a reservation. ÊAnd be sure to arrive early to look for parking.

Due to an episode of "Check Please - SF Bay Area" on KQED that I saw recently, we decided to drive up from Palo Alto to try lunch here. ÊBefore leaving PA, I called to make a reservation to make sure we had a spot for 1PM. ÊDespite traffic congestion, we made it to this area of North Beach and lucky to find parking so close as well (thanks St. Francis..national shrine just kitty corner from this restaurant!). We were greeted with a smile and seated in the L-shaped dining room. ÊOur table for two was located just in the middle of the dining room. ÊThe restaurant was 1/2 full with a large table full of business folks to one side and a small group of three folks at the table on the other side. After reviewing the menu, our server came back to take our order. She recited today's specials, which all sounded so delectable! ÊFor an appetizer, we opted for the daily special of grilled calamari that was bathed in a roasted tomato sauce and topped with dry Bonita shavings. There was a hint of a BBQ taste to the tomato sauce which was surprising yet all of the flavors married well in this savory dish. I ordered the Warm wasabi house noodles with grilled salmon. ÊThe noodles were thick and flecked with ruby red dry pepper flakes. ÊThin match strip sticks of cucumber lay atop the noodles followed by the grilled salmon. ÊOn top of the salmon was what I would call an "asian cole slaw." ÊIt was very delicious and the spiciness was just right. Ê My son ordered one of the specials of the day which was the rib eye that came with steamed baby bok choy and whipped mashed potatoes that had a flavored oil infusion just beneath it. ÊHe ordered it medium rare and we both found it delicious and full of flavor. I had the Jasmine pearl for my pot of hot tea. ÊThe fragrance and taste suited my lunch choice very well. ÊThere are many choices for hot tea as well as wine by the bottle and glass. ÊThey also have sodas available. Neither one of us finished our entire meal (the servings were generous) so we took a to-go box for the left overs. Service was attentive by the waitstaff. ÊAfter our appetizers, our small plates and flatware were removed and replaced with new ones. ÊYou really don't want to use the same flatware when going from one dish to another and this spot has it down right. We look forward to returning to The House for many visits to come!

What can I say about a fantastic restaurant that nearly 1000 other people haven't already said? ÊNonetheless, I loved this place enough that I had to write a review. I am not a fan of Asian fusion at all, but even I highly recommend The House! ÊLoved the unique food -- they didn't try too hard to try to stretch an asian dish to make it crazy fancy and call it "fusion." ÊInstead, they has a great balance between East and West styles of cooking and ingredients, creating dishes the way fusion should be done. ÊEvery single menu item our party had was delicious, and the staff is incredibly personable. Ê Easy to miss and hard to find... don't trust your GPS when trying to find it. ÊDefinitely go, soon!

Believe it or not............It use to be better. Came here for a friends birthday. It was probably around 10 pm when I had to decide on a restaurant near my house. I haven't been here for a while because this place has gotten so busy. It has gotten commercialized in a way. I guess from a business stand point, it's fantastic, but from a local stand point, not as nice. We had the table next to the door and it was freezing tonight, so my friend had his jacket on the whole night. For two people we had: Fried salmon with pickled, spicy cabbage with hot mustard on the side Crab cake Caesar salad with fried bay scallops tuna tartar on nori chips Sea bass Flank steak For dessert............almond/tapioca pudding The disappointment was the crab cake. It literally looked like a cake. A lot of junk in there that hides the crab. Not sure if there were any crab in there at all. The other disappointment was the table. It's a small restaurant so I can't really complain. The whole restaurant probably hold around 50 ppl but maybe 40 comfortably. The highlight was probably the sea bass, the noodles, the string beans, the fried salmon roll, and the dessert. The servers were very attentive and my glass of water was never empty. This probably was one of the first restaurant that brought in the east meets west "fusion" cuisine back in the day.

I totally forgot but THE HOUSE was where I dined at for Senior Prom back in 2003! Back then it was located on 9th between Irving St. and Lincoln Way. Now the place is called Kiki's (Japanese Restaurant, same owner as Kitaro's on Geary). In any case, I was able to visit THE HOUSE this past Friday night and I can't believe I forgot about this restaurant! And I also can't believe it took me 6 years to come back to devour their awesome food. Mmm... The place is a lot smaller than their 9th Ave location. There are about 10-15 tables in here and it's really narrow. Yes, I know what you're thinking -- MAKE RESERVATIONS!! We sat back near the kitchen so every time the door open, I saw flames go up. Way cool...but does anyone else notice the weird smell that comes breezing through? I'm not sure if its from the kitchen, the bathroom, or the servers? Shrug. I read some reviews about the House before and I have to disagree with what everyone is saying about their not-so-great service. Either you guys are real snobs and beezies and want impeccable service or their service really sucked when you went, and got better the day I came. The server started off ranting off a bunch of their specials, and I was quite proud that she remember them all. Water was constantly refilled and our plates were constantly changed. This was awesome. Service was attentive. 5 stars for that. COMPLIMENTARY VINEGAR CUCUMBER SLICES Beware: VERY vinegar-ey. I choked on a piece since it was soooooo tangy but nonetheless it was very refreshing. OYSTERS http://static.px.yelp.coÉ Not as good as Foreign Cinema's oysters but still AOK in my book. The sauce it came with was a mix of...you know what I have no clue. All I know it was spicy as F!! 6 raw oysters came on a plate. SHRIMP DUMPLINGS http://static.px.yelp.coÉ 7 dumplings for $9? Sure, I guess. Kinda pricey for pretty well made dumplings but this is a must get dish for all you dumpling lovers. The shrimp wasn't mashed up into small pieces but it was a good sized chunk of shrimp in the dumpling. The chives in it were fresh. The skin was rolled thin and it was absolutely delicious. The sauce it came in was a mix of soy sauce, green onions, and a ton of vinegar. Yum. SALMON ROLLS http://static.px.yelp.coÉ o m gee. The House just put a new meaning to egg rolls. Screw egg rolls -- bring on the salmon rolls!! There are two pieces on this plate, perfect to eat by yourself or share with someone else. The salmon is fried to the point where it's half cooked -- PERFECT. The skin was fried crispy and you could barely taste the seaweed for all you non-seaweed fans. However, this dish did come with a Chinese mustard dipping sauce. It pretty much was a blend of spicy mustard and horseradish. Don't put too much on, it really gets you in the nose!! Before I go onto the entrees that we ordered, I have to say that yes, 2 people did eat 3 appetizers, haha. Mmm after we finished these 3 dishes, we realized that The House is big on... 1. Horseradish 2. Vinegar WASABI NOODLES & FLAT IRON STEAK http://static.px.yelp.coÉ The steak was ok. It was steak. Meat. Cow. Steak. Yeah, nothing to rave about. But the wasabi noodles were off the hook! The noodles were chewy and of a good consistency. I was a bit turned off by the wasabi because I'm not a big fan of it but the amount of wasabi in this dish was just perfect. It didn't kick my ass nor did it completely leave me alone. I loved it. I picked out every piece of noodle until it was completely gone. Yum Yum Yum. BLACKENED COD WITH SUSHI (special for the night) http://static.px.yelp.coÉ The infamous Sushi. This was made long just like the salmon rolls and cut in a weird way, just like the salmon rolls. The sushi was really tasty. I dipped it in the sauce that the cod came in and it was good. The sauce was similar to unagi (eel) sauce but something was different. But OMG, the cod. OMG. OMG. OMG. OMG. Melted in my mouth like butter. It was so soft, cooked to perfection. I don't even think my mom can cook fish that good. Damn, the house threw it down as far as the cod goes. Damage done: $76.50 pre-tip (Oh and the bill here is handwritten. On it, our waitress denoted our Shrimp Dumplings as "DUMPY." I laughed for a good minute or two. Cute!) SUMMARY: Service was attentive. No complaints. Food was orgasmic...I mean delightful. Salmon Rolls are a MUST order. Reservations needed and highly recommended!! The House is newly dubbed as one of my favorite restaurants in SF. The House deserves to be my 300th review on Yelp. Woop!

Wow. ÊThe House just entered my top 5 favorite restaurants in the city. ÊYou know how sometimes you look at a menu and have a hard time deciding between a couple of items? ÊAt the House I wanted to order just about everything! ÊAnd that was before we heard about the nightly specials... Portions are HUGE-we easily could have gotten away with splitting an app and one entree. ÊMy seared ahi tuna entree (boring, I know) was perfect, served over sticky rice and sauteed spinach, with a pool of spicy wasabi sauce around the plate. ÊYum. Service was friendly albeit a bit aloof but didn't distract from one of the best meals I've had in months.

The first time I went to The House, it was the location on 9th and Irving 12 years ago. Since then, I've been to many Asian-fusion and Asian-inspired restaurants, but always find myself coming back here. I missed the location on 9th, which closed many years ago, but willing to brave hunt for parking in the middle of North Beach to come here. After a day at the Academy of Sciences, my folks wanted to have the kids over for dinner, so the wife and I had an unexpected date night. So here we are. It's the weekday night in the middle of the Christmas/New Years Holidays, and this place is packed. And we didn't have any reservations. The hostess/waitstaff person greeted us and asked if we had reservations. We said no and she said the next reservation would be at 9:30, or she can take our name down, and maybe in 20 minutes a seat will open up. Fifteen minutes later, we were seated. We were pretty fortunate because more people without reservations walked in and had to wait. Usually we order a couple of appetizers, but this time we only shared one (no, we didn't do the cute-Asian-couple-celebrating-their-one-month-?dating-anniversary-sharing-the-same-plate-and-?feeding-each-other-thing) -seared scallops with cilantro and citrus sauce, and caviar garnish. This was a special of the day. Three seared scallops, perfectly seared and warm. Topped with watercress. Very good and light start. For large plates, one of us usually orders the Chilean Sea Bass, but some of the specials sounded pretty interesting: -miso glazed black cod with ponzu with Chinese broccoli (gai lan), and a diagonally cut California roll. This was a daily special. The black cod was very light and had an almost fluffy texture to it. Miso glaze matched well with the cod, as well as the ponzu sauce. California roll, instead of being cut into circular pieces, was cut diagonally into 2 pieces. Pretty good, dungeness crab was used. Actually white rice would have been just fine to match the ponzu sauce. -kurobota pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce, mash potatoes, asparagus. In the web site, Niman Ranch is listed as the pork, but on this menu, kurobota was used instead. Very juicy and moist pork chop, not dry. Sauce was sweet from the pomegranate and current juice and seeds, but enough to complement it, not over power it. So good, I gnawed off the rest of the meat off the bone. Dessert? Gotta have dessert. Wife asked which one was lighter: the mango tapioca, or the passionfruit creme brulee. She got the mango tapioca; I got something on the other side of the spectrum. -mango tapioca: nice floral pattern made with mango puree. It was very light and refreshing. -chocolate truffle cake with caramel and coffee ice cream. Very chocolate-ty without being overly sweet. The truffle cake was dense, but a little on the dry side this time. Had this other times, and it was really moist. Otherwise, still pretty happy with the dessert and good way to end the dinner. This place still remains one of my favorites. Well prepared and flavorful dishes. We'll be back again and again and again.......

After I got over the whole "my life is filled with doom & gloom, I'm so ancient" melodrama, I let the best friend kidnap me & force me to have a happy freakin' birthday instead of boo-hooing into my morning cup of coffee. I swear, nothing says you are loved like a birthday lunch at The House. I had my favorite thing on the menu: the seabass with garlic ginger soy sauce, green beans & noodles (just *reading* about it makes you drool, don't it?) And ended the meal with their mango tapioca. In the past year, we've been to The House many times to celebrate many things. I love their minimalistic decor, leaving nothing to distract you from your gorgeous plate of incredible food. Their flavors are consistently amazing palate pleasers & service is attentive/friendly. *sigh* I'm a year older (probably not any wiser), but the end of my 20's started out in a really delicious way this year, thanks to the BFF.

I give this one four stars and one emphatic hell yeah. The food is delicious, BUT the atmosphere really isn't. Don't even try coming to this little spot at dinnertime without a reservation. It has the related problem of being very loud (even for those of us without an inside voice), and full of d-bags and matching dates. If you can get over those things and focus on your food, you'll be a happy camper. Though the food is probably best described as Asian fusion, don't be fooled into thinking you wandered into the food court at the mall. We started off with some calamari, which was really good; but calamari seems kind of hard to f up. I went with an entree of warm wasabi house noodles with Angus flatiron steak with a glass of red and it was off-the-hook tasty. Dessert of a mango creme brulee topped off my hungries just right. This all ran us about $50 a person, so well worth it for a nice treat or celebration dinner, especially after a long, chilly day.

Never disappoints. Came here 3 times in one week when I first discovered it. Must order: Sea Bass, Ribeye Steak, Mushroom rice w/ Prawns. All their dishes are extremely flavorful. I love the garlic noodles that come with the sea bass almost as much as the sea bass, perhaps even a tad more. Ribeye steak is amazingly flavorful..love the garlic chips that they sprinkle generously all over the steak. Mushroom risotto is a must-have if you like mushrooms. Also love the pork chop (surprisingly delicious for pork!). The only entree that I don't really like on the menu is the ahi tuna..thought it was underwhelming/sorta bland. Fried salmon roll app is yummy too. Never really impressed with their dessert, but the portions are very generous so this is generally a moot point since we're usually too full to order dessert anyhow. Awesome, friendly staff AND no additional healthy SF tax yay.

I'm a sucker for presentation and these guys do a great job making asian fusion-y dishes look cool. The ambiance was ok, nothing stunning; some art on the walls and reasonable lighting. The room was a bit cramped and there was no curtain over the door; I was blasted with drafts whenever people left the restaurant (a pet peeve, grrr). I started with the white shrimp dumplings, a straightforward but tasty dish. My main course was the special, sea bass with a crab roll on top, sounds odd but it looked and tasted delicious. Flavor combinations in the dishes I tried weren't super complex, they don't try to harmonize as much as other places like Brick (an SF newbie). Bottom line: They do hit the mark for good quality asian fusion cuisine.

Their appetizers are clear winners over their entrees. ÊStar appetizers were: - White Shrimp and Chinese Chive Dumplings - Ahi Tune Tartare with Roasted Nori Chips - Deep-fried Salmon Roll with Chinese Hot Mustard In contrast, I had never liked their entrees. ÊMany are too oily and flavoring is not "Asian" enough to be called Asian-fusion. Ê Why pair seared Ahi-Tuna with Mustard sauce? Ê Don't they get that you put wasabi (horseradish), not karashi (mustard), on your raw tuna?

Small restaurant with an amazing Asian Fusion menu. I've been here a couple of times already. The last time I came with a group of 10 for a birthday and they were able to accommodate us. FYI: for birthdays, they have a cake cutting fee. Everything was amazing. If I had a list of items you have to order, it would be 1) Deep Fried Salmon Roll 2) Ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips 3) Grilled Sea Bass. Other honorable mentions include their Blue lake green bean tempura and pork chop. Romantic ambiance. Perfect for special occasions or just a regular date. Parking may be a bit difficult, though. There is a parking lot on Vallejo between Powell and Stockton, which is within walking distance to the restaurant.

Definitely my go-to spot in the city! ÊI've tried majority of the dishes here and everything is cooked to perfection. ÊMy old favorite dish was the wasabi noodles with the flank steak, and the Cod has become my new favorite. Ê The cons - The place is really small and the loudness can get to you. They do have a time limit for those of you with or without a reservation as they have a relatively quick turnover. Not great for a first date kind of place, but a great place to enjoy good and great company. Ê Oh, and I did I mention the mango tapioca dessert is to die for?

Restaurants like "the House" are giving the high-end 5-star restaurants a run for their money. The menu here is inventive, modern, and accessible. ÊThe service is friendly and efficient. ÊThe environment is clean and minimal. ÊAnd the clientele is engaged but not out of control. ÊAll of this in North Beach, no less. Clearly, I liked everything about my experience at House, but what was really outstanding was the food. ÊI am still dreaming of it this morning as I write this review. ÊThe delicate yet bold flavors as well as the presentation made each bite a delight - but again, in a very accessible way. ÊEvery combination worked perfectly, highlighting the best of each ingredient. We started with 1/2 dozen oysters which came with a spicy cilantro-laden mignonette. ÊThe mignonette was strong but totally complimented the flavor of the oysters. ÊDelicious. For appetizers, my friend had the Roasted Mushroom Soup and I had the Curried White Shrimp and Mango Salad. ÊMmmm! ÊThe soup was velvety and rich, with a hearty flavor and a drizzle of truffle oil - so warming on a chilly night. ÊMy salad was great - shrimp in a creamy curry sauce with mango slices and expertly dressed greens. ÊI enjoyed every bite. For our main courses, my friend had the Sea Bass and I had a special, a Miso-encrusted Cod. ÊWow. ÊBoth excellent. ÊI loved the taste of the Sea Bass - again, perfectly prepared and not overcooked. ÊMine was simply awesome - 2 crab rolls draped over the dish like mermaids lounging in the sun, atop a generous portion of butter-soft fish that fell apart to the touch. ÊServed with broccoli rabe and dressed in a light sauce, this dish was so flavorful and beautiful to look at. To accompany our dishes, we had a bottle of Barbera which was very rich and jammy without being heavy. For dessert, we split the Mango Tapioca and the Chocolate TART (and by "tart" I mean pastry - inside joke - hi, Mark!!!). ÊAgain, both well done and rich without being overwhelming. When you consider all that you are getting, the value of this restaurant is hard to beat. ÊEntrees land in the high teens, with appetizers and desserts just hovering around the $10 mark. Ê It's date-worthy and impressive without breaking the bank, special without having to wait for a holiday to visit. In describing the type of food to someone else, I hesitate to say fusion, which sounds dated, and the House is anything but dated. ÊI would say that some dishes have an Asian influence, and the menu is definitely more fish-heavy than meat-heavy, although there is a chicken, pork and beef option on the regular menu. ÊIt is everything that I think of when I think of California-style cuisine - fresh ingredients, bright flavors, with a casually elegant style. Ê I will definitely visit the House again, and I feel sure that it will soon take its place among my favorite restaurants in San Francisco.

This place used to be easily one of my favorite restaurants in SF. We recently celebrated 7 years of wedded bliss and were in need of a not-too-spendy dinner location since we were embarking on some serious travel a couple of days later. While the food remained excellent, everything else about the experience sucked. We concluded that while the food still rocks, The House is not special occasion worthy any longer (if it ever was). Indifferent service met us at every turn, from straining to hear the waiter over the din of people talking (I told him I couldn't hear him and he leaned closer maybe an inch. maybe.) to not even being offered all of the specials... to many more points that I won't even elaborate on lest I end up sounding like a disgruntled crazy for not being treated "special" on her special day. But we all know when the service sucks it can ruin your entire experience and in this case, on a night that was supposed to be a celebration, it was most definitely ruined by crappy service. My original review said: we celebrated the hubby's B-day dinner a year or so back and we really had a phenomenal experience. Everything we ordered was fantastic, including 2 apps, 2 entrees, wine, dessert with birthday candle, port... the bill was pretty reasonable and we walked out with extremely satisfied taste buds and feelin' fine. I'm sure we'll go back but it will be for a run-of-the -mill dinner out. 3.5 stars...

I can honestly say this is a review that I never wanted to write. ÊThe House has long been one of my favorite restaurants in North Beach. ÊBeing a resident of the predominantly Italian and Chinese neighborhood, an inventive fusion restaurant like The House is a perfect tonic to the more traditional leanings represented by each cuisine in North Beach. Ê Ê Two weeks ago my wife and I had a good friend in from New York City. ÊWe were on our way back from a "Friday Night at the DeYoung" and at a loss for a place to eat. ÊGiven the time, 8:00pm on a Friday night, The House seemed like a long shot. ÊMy wife was able to call from the cab and lasso a reservation for three. ÊHyping our guest on what was sure to be a memorable dining experience filled the rest of our cab ride. ÊI had no idea how memorable. Ê Ê When we arrived we were sat immediately in a corner table and settled in to our dinner. ÊWe began with two appetizers to share, one being a roasted eel that was at once subtle and spicy. ÊThe other was an Ahi tuna dish that was also outstanding. ÊFor our entrees my wife and her friend had the steak with noodles, while I opted for the Monkfish special. ÊAs we began enjoying our main dishes, I saw my friends eyes widen across from me. ÊShe gestured to my wife to slowly look over her right shoulder. ÊMy wife spun around to be greeted by a cockroach the size of quarter making its way up the wall. Ê Ê While this was slightly disturbing, and a bit embarrassing given the amount of praise we had exhorted on behalf of the restaurant, we could easily forgive a single, renegade roach, in a building that was upwards of 100 years old. ÊMy wife tactfully caught the roach inside her napkin and placed the wadded up dragnet in a bowl on our table. ÊWhat became harder to ignore was the succession of roaches that followed. ÊEmerging from a crevice where the two walls met behind my wife, two more made their way up the wall followed by another. Ê Ê Now I have worked in the restaurant industry for some 15 years and in that time I have encountered many a delicate situation involving bugs. ÊI knew that causing a scene wouldn't be prudent but clearly our dining experience was over. ÊI quietly made my way over to the manager, alerting her to the unwanted increase to our reservation. ÊI explained to her that we wanted the check, to which she asked if we wanted dessert? ÊI said, "No just the check." ÊAlthough she was very apologetic, she seemed reluctant to make any sort of overture regarding reducing our bill. ÊMy friend from New York helped her out by volunteering not to pay for her entree. ÊThis was taken off the bill and we started to gather our belongings to leave. ÊThe other patrons were seemingly none the wiser and we assumed that they would refrain from seating this table after we left. Ê Ê What the manager said next was easily the most baffling explanation for our early exit I have ever received in all my years of dining. ÊShe calmly began to explain to me that different people have different "thresholds" for this kind of thing. ÊSomehow this was an example of a lack of fortitude on our part? ÊI have to admit that this sort of logic infuriated me given the fact that we were paying $25 a plate!! ÊI was tempted to produce the interned roach from the wadded up napkin on our table, present it to the manager so as to ascertain her "threshold". ÊPerhaps other customers could weigh in and we could get some kind of consensus on the matter. ÊMaybe there was a Gallop poll we could refer to in an effort to find a national "threshold" for roaches with dinner. Ê Ê As we left the restaurant dumbfounded, I paused to see if they would reseat our table. ÊWe made our way through the crowded restaurant as another party of three replaced us at the table. ÊI wondered how they would react to what was sure to be a recurring problem the rest of the night. ÊI guess The House was banking on this table having a higher "threshold".

It was weird. ÊI didn't like the sea bass. Ê Yes, I walked in dreaming of my cod, light, succulent and satisfying, but it was not on special, so I was content to try something else. ÊEveryone loves the sea bass, so I did not hesitate to venture into new fishdom that evening. Ê It was thick and very rich. ÊI wouldn't say it was tough, but it was not even close to the delicate-barely-touched-with-heat cod or tuna I am used to. ÊThat, and the side of noodles was so thick and salty, I felt like something was off. ÊAlso, there was no shortage of green beans in my plate and they were pretty oily and also very salty. ÊIt just took me by surprise. ÊTruth is - it was good, but it was MAN-good, meaning it was thick and robust. Ê...Not what I expect from a House fish dish and definitely not what I wanted that night. Weird. However, the salmon appetizer was spot on, as was the tuna (I snagged a bite from another). ÊOur friend, a-meat-and-potatoes-ONLY kind of a guy, had the steak and ate every last morsel. There was love in his eyes. ÊWe might have opened a new door for him that night. I took half my dish to go, which is odd for me, and skipped out on dessert, which is even odder for me; especially because I love The House's passion fruit creme brulee (it is one of my favorite combinations). ÊBut I didn't even have space for that. I wonder if it is okay to make reservations and then call that same day to make sure they have the special I want. ÊIs that wrong? I feel like it is wrong, but I am going to do it anyway.

Packed last night, for a weekday too. ÊGuy who greeted us didn't crack a smile the entire night as he seated people. ÊGuess I expected something more warm (like Blue Plate) for a place called the House. Food made up for it. ÊWe started off with the: Ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips - Served a bit too warm, but the fish was fresh. ÊChips went nicely. Deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard - Served at room temperature which is unexpected for deep-fried food. ÊIngredients were fresh though and mustard was amazing. Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy - Excellent piece of fish and perfectly cooked. ÊMelts in your mouth. ÊGreen beans and noodles were a delicious side. ÊI usually order fish for a lighter dinner, but this is a heavy meal. Kurobota ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce - He had this and I couldn't stop eating it. ÊI rarely order pork at restaurant, but I would definitely here. ÊPiggy was cooked perfectly without being overly dry. ÊSauce is to die for. ÊMashed potatos were creamy, but stiff enough to hold up to the sauce and meat. Ê Ended it with the apple pie crumb a la mode and flourless bittersweet chocolate cake with coffee ice cream and coconut caramel. ÊLooked like whoever plated the dessert took a huge spoon and threw a glop of the pie in a bowl -- broken up into chunks. ÊNot particularly unique desserts, but very tasty. Food came out very quickly. ÊFood that should have been colder was warm and dishes you'd expect to be piping hot, were room temp. ÊPie plating was a huge turn off. ÊI expect more from a resaurant that boasts 700+ reviews at 4.5 stars. ÊIngredients were excellent, but I was a bit disappointed with the entire experience.

Recently my favorite Washingtonian and I were treated to dinner at The House. While the mathematician of our lot translated the numerous conversations carrying on in Mandarin around us, we ordered the Blue Lake green bean tempura, the asparagus with roasted sesame dressing and the Maine crab cake to start. I should begin by saying that "Asian fusion" isn't really my thing. Far too many folks slap wasabi or ginger or soy on something and call it "Asian fusion." And don't even get me started on the kimchi imposters (it should be a crime to call these awful cabbage slaws KIMCHI!) That said The House is in a league all its own when it comes to "Asian fusion." One look around the restaurant and that becomes clear. After all, when was the last time you saw Asian families packing the tables at places like Betelnut or Roy's? They, along with diners of every hue, pack The House because the food is immaculate! Our entire table was impressed at every turn from the appetizers I mentioned above to the main courses (flat iron steak served over wasabi noodles, grilled sea bass and sashimi) to the desserts (where the mango tapioca was a surprising stand-out.) NOTES: Make reservations, this place is tiny and was completely packed on a Tuesday night Service can be brusque but is always efficient Do NOT skip dessert While waiting do not remove the menu that is taped to the window to look at it - this really irritates the woman who runs the front of the house. Instead ask her for a copy of the menu. CONCLUSION: The House is no flash in the pan - the restaurant's been around since 1993 and remains at the top of its game.

Let me see. How do I put this gently? NEVER FUCKING EAT HERE EVER!!! How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways. I ordered one of the daily fish specials, which was Cod. I was about 20% into my meal when I suddenly crunched into something extremely hard. Fish bone? No. I wish. I spit it out onto my plate, and it was a hard clear shard or something. I showed it to my server, guessing it was glass. She apologized profusely and brought me another entree 20 minutes later, explaining that it was not glass but a piece of plastic from the sushi. Whatever that means. I'm still convinced it was a fucking piece of broken glass that could've fucked up my mouth if I had chewed it any longer. And of course when they brought me my replacement entree, they didn't think to replace my silverware, so I sat there for a while staring at it and trying to flag a server down to get me some utensils. The staff won a few points back when they brought me free dessert. Too bad I passed on dessert during the order because I'M ON A FUCKING DIET, but whatever. It's the thought that counts. Though I think that the better thing to do would have been to comp me my dinner. At this point, I would've put the restaurant into the 2-3 star bucket because the food was only reasonable - not delicious enough for me to crave it or want to come back, but tasty enough for me to not feel bitter that I didn't just cook for myself at home. But then I got home. I started to feel really dizzy and bloated, so I went to lie down. My body started shaking, and I felt chills running up and down my limbs. All of a sudden, an intense pang of nausea struck me, so I ran to the bathroom. Yes, I then projectile vomited for the next hour. And you bitches don't even want to KNOW what other symptoms I endured over the NEXT FOUR DAYS. These are symptoms you'd expect to endure if you lapped a gallon of sewage out of the gutter in a 3rd world country. Every part of my body failed me. I should've gone to the ER, but I was too weak to sit upright. So to sum up my review, NEVER EAT HERE. The food is NOT worth the risk.

My dining experience at the House was absolutely stellar. ÊWith so many positive reviews, I came with very high expectations. ÊHow did it turn out? ÊThey more than succeeded on every aspect here. Came on a surprisingly very busy Sunday. ÊWe had reservations at 7:30 but the super nice hostess sat us as soon as we arrived. ÊLove that. ÊIn fact, everyone was really nice and welcoming here, especially considering how busy it was. We had the crab cake (huge and delicious), deep-fried chicken liver (yes, you read correctly and it was DAMN good!), mushroom risotto and a perfectly prepared ribeye steak. They knew what they're doing in that tiny kitchen and our server understood the ever so important aspect of timing. We were never waiting for our next course. Can service be too efficient? ÊOh hell to the no! From the superior service to the cozy interior to the superb food, I have nothing but love for the House. ÊHeck, I wish it was my house.

Absolutely delightful, my lunch here was a light and incredibly flavorful treat. I would have easily passed by The House numerous times without stopping in, and even upon arrival I wasn't all that impressed by the surroundings: it all seemed super casual, and at not so casual prices. But the food, ohhh the food. The crispy salmon roll was as delicious as everyone has said: a hearty, shareable portion and unlike anything I've ever eaten before. My unagi with avocado sandwich was messy but perfection: crunch grilled bread, super fresh avocado, and flavorful unagi. I loved it. I also got to sample the sea bass, which was SO good, although I'm not sure it was worth the nearly doubled price over the other lunch options (it was $20). If you're hungry, the noodle servings were huge, and also very tasty: I'd definitely try them the next time around. All in all, a perfectly prepared and delicious lunch that left me feeling full sans food coma; and that I had splurged without going overboard. A pretty perfect lunch, indeed.

I briefly thought about giving this spot four stars, but one look back on the price and this is definitely a five star place for so many reasons. The number one reason I would say this is a five star restaurant is because you essentially get huge portions and very Gary Danko like inspirations for 1/4 the price per dish. The service is great, the restaurant is small and intimate and the atmosphere is very warm and inviting (if you had a reservation ... not so much if you wanted to stand around and wait). The menu is small but delightfully packed with delicious choices that made it hard for me to pick just one. I had two appetizers and two entrees and the whole bill came out to be less than $60 or so. Wow!?!?! This is amazing just because it's San Francisco! Their choices are fusion, and yes as much as I'm not the biggest fan of most fusion places, this place is downright delicious and rightfully reviewed as one of the better restaurants in SF. I can't wait to come back!

I am obsessed with this restaurant. When I crave food from the House, I am Homer Simpson daydreaming about donuts and beer. My devotion to the House is so intense I admit it's borderline creepy. I am like a religious fanatic trying to spread the good word or something. Anyone who knows me knows that this is my favorite restaurant and if I come across a friend who has never been, I make it my mission to take them there. And everyone eventually drinks the koolaid and converts. But why wouldn't they? What's not to love? It's intensely flavorful yet down-to-earth food at a reasonable price in a charming restaurant in a fun neighborhood. So if at some point I introduce the House to a new friend who does not immediately fall in love with their wonderfulness, I am prepared to end that friendship. I know that sounds extreme but hello? have you been to the House? After all, how can I possibly be friends with someone with such poor taste and judgement? Fortunately, I haven't had to put anyone on the chopping block - my conversion rate so far is 100%. If I do have a beef with this place, it is TINY and it's that as long as I've been eating there (10 years) and as often as I go (sometimes weekly), you'd think the owner/hostess would at least pretend to recognize me. I guess that's the Asian side of this fusion restaurant. Good thing I don't go there for the warm fuzzies. It's really all about the food anyway.

Tasty, tasty, tasty. We've been coming to The House for years--and they have never failed us. When visitors come up to Northern California, The House is usually my top 5 restaurants that I refer them too. The place is a little on the smaller side but offers a very cozy feel to it. The staff is especially friendly and quite funny. You also cannot beat the price for the high quality food and presentation. Your average dinner plate is around $20 and worth every penny! The Sea Bass is a MUST! Extremely well seasoned and melts in your mouth. The garlic noodles that they pair them with are exquisite! Other tasty favs include the flatiron steak and any of the specials of the day. As for appetizers, you have to try the deep fried salmon rolls! Don't confuse them with the Cheesecake Factory's "Firecracker Rolls" because they will quickly correct you on that! Ê:) Another tip is that you really need to make reservations for this place as they are always packed but extremely worth the wait!! It's too bad that I live in the South Bay or I would be a weekly regular!

I've heard about this place for the longest time, and after seeing various reviews on here, it was time to check it out for myself. My wife made reservations for just the two of us at first, but when we tried to call back and add several more family members, they shot us down. Funny, there were open tables around us when we dined. First off, I had no idea that the restaurant was in front of my nose all these years. When they mean "tucked in," it's no joke. I've probably passed by numerous times. Unfortunately, it also means that particular area is a pain in the butt to find parking. After circling around a million times, and that we were already late for our reservation, it was time to suck it up and pay for parking at one of those private lots. Drat. Upon arriving, the waitress gave us a very serious look and said since we're late, we'd have to leave in about an hour, since they allocated an hour and half for our reservation. Eh? I thought that was rather weird. So stop wasting our time talking to us, and seat us at our table already! Since we already checked out the menu online, we wasted no time. After hearing the specials, we went for the grilled calamari salad and the fried salmon roll for starters. For entrees, my wife had the mushroom rice with grilled prawns, while I had the grilled sea bass. Overall, I thought that everything had tremendous balance of flavors, as everything complemented well with each other. The grilled calamari within the salad still had that charred flavor that I love. The fried salmon inside the roll was perfectly cooked, very light and crispy on the outside. I had a taste of the mushroom rice, which is essentially risotto, and I thought it was pretty good. The prawns were bursting with flavor, I probably could've just had ohh, about a few dozen of those suckers. As for my sea bass, I thought that it was slightly overcooked, but still very good overall. It had tons of grilled flavor and from the garlic ginger soy sauce, and the udon noodles were a nice balance to the crunchy texture of the green beans. I was a bit worried at whether I'd be full after my entree, but no worries here. For dessert, we opted for the kobacha squash pie, or just Japanese pumpkin pie. When they brought out the slice, I thought it was rather small, sitting next to a bed of fluffy whipped cream. It was pretty similar to regular pumpkin pie, perhaps with a few chopped pecans or walnuts sprinkled in there. For $7, it's probably not the best value, as they probably just outsourced an entire pie at some bakery for the same amount. Overall though, I was satisfied with the meal. Not quite sure I would return, as there are just so many other places to try in SF (got a loooong Yelp bookmark list). Price-wise, it's not horrible. As for the service, they seem a bit robotic and completely lacking in soul, but hey they are efficient and quick to top off our water. 4 stars.

I came here for lunch today with a co-worker; all the other teams at work were having end of the year celebrations so I insisted that the two of us have our own banquet. I gave her three restaurant choices in North Beach (near our office) and she wanted this one. I secretly wanted this one too. It was my second time at The House and without just getting over food poisoning, I was free to order whatever I wanted. I started with the shitake mushroom soup with white truffles dressed on the top. MOTHER. OF. GOD. I don't even like mushrooms that much, but this could have been the best soup I've ever had in my life. No joke. The BEST. For my main course, I got the sesame soy salmon that came with rice and some mysterious vegetable that didn't really have a taste but I ate anyway because I was feverishly scarfing down everything on my plate. My co-worker ordered the sea bass that arrived with green beans and some type of noodles. I'm so glad I came back again. This place puts the "yaw" in "totally awesome."

Here are a few tips: Don't be a douche; tip well. Make reservations. ÊSeriously, we were turned away because they were booked for the whole night. ÊAnd the place is small The food is awesome, I don't think there is a single item on the menu that will disappoint. Parking is not so ample. The place mats have a house cut out at the bottom, you're not spilling your food. ÊNo need to do a double take. This time: Ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips Deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard I forget what kind of steak, but it was the special for the day. Ahi Tuna was fresh The salon roll was crunchy and perfectly cooked. ÊThe Hot mustard sauce can catch you off guard, but nevertheless was delicious with the salmon roll. Ordered the steak medium, and it was more medium well on the outside and medium rare on the inside. ÊExtremely juicy. For next time(s): Oysters Maine crab cake with pickled ginger remoulade Deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy Chicken breast with roasted portabella white truffle oil sauce Niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce

Seeing that The House had an outstanding review rating of 4 and a half stars with 512 reviews, I had to check it out and consequently had high expectations. ÊI really wanted to love The House, I did. Unfortunately, I feel The House is yet another over-hyped spot. ÊI liked it, but I didn't love it. ÊI'm gonna give it a solid 3. ÊI felt that the food was 'aight, but nothing I'm going to be craving afterward and daydreaming about. We had the tuna tar tar, the white shrimp tempura and the scallop special to begin with. Ê(Yea, we were starving). ÊI felt the tar tar was overly seasoned with wasabi and/or horseradish, which completely overpowered the delicate flavor of the Ahi tuna. ÊThe white shrimp tempura was great, but they gave us only 2 large shrimp and a shitload of salad heaped on top. ÊI was expecting the amount Êof shrimp to be more like what you would receive with an order of calamari, so I felt the dish was a bit skimp. ÊBut, the flavor was wonderful and it left me desiring more. ÊLastly the scallop special. ÊIt was the only appetizer I was'nt disappointed with. ÊIt was great-the scallops were seared perfectly and were quite large. On to our main dishes. ÊI ordered the sea bass with garlic noodles and green beans and my bf ordered the Angus steak dish with wasabi noodles. ÊMy boyfriend really loved his dish, but I was disappointed with mine as well as his. ÊI felt like both of them were too charbroiled and left that nasty burnt taste in my mouth- both the bass and the steak. ÊAnd, I really love garlic noodles and was looking forward to mine but was sadly let down when they were nowhere near as good as Crustacean's. ÊAnd, they gave me this sauce to dip my fish and/or beans in- it provided some improvement flavor but without it the dish would have been just plain bad. ÊThe dessert was pretty solid- crumb apple pie a la mode. ÊBut, I felt like it could have had more crumb. I will say this- our server and the other employees were very courteous and friendly, which added to the experience. ÊI felt like our server was reading my mind and preemptively providing answers to questions I hadn't even asked yet. ÊThat was nice. Maybe I'll give it another try in the future, but I'm not dying to go back. ÊI'm actually quite surprised it has such a good rating on Yelp- thats pretty damn hard to obtain.

Some hits and some misses. SPIFFY FOOD: - Lots of great dishes... I really liked the salmon rolls, the ahi tuna tartar with roasted nori chips, the unagi on rice, and the flank steak. ÊTotally want to try the sea bass next time. - Non-alcoholic drinks: The lycee iced tea was quite good with free refills. ÊThere were many interesting hot teas on the menu too I was tempted by, including the cool tea that blooms into a flower inside your cup. ÊAll this stuff was really affordable ($2-5). UNSPIFFY FOOD: - Too many dishes used a similar wasabi-based sauce. ÊI'm a huge wasabi fan but you can only have so much of it before it starts feeling gimmicky. - I didn't really like the green bean tempura appetizer the waitress recommended as "easy to share". ÊFirst it was arranged in a Jenga arrangement (remember that game?) with the sauce container underneath so there was really no way to access the sauce without knocking all the beans over. ÊPlus, you know how when you go to a Japanese restaurant and you order a bento box with tempura and the suckiest pieces are always the veggies at the end? ÊYeah, this was like that only the whole thing was green beans. - The portion size was probably a bit too generous on the entrees. ÊIt was an ordeal to finish my entree. ÊI would have preferred family-style or tapas-style and the opportunity to sample more dishes. COOL: - The paper placemat was cute with a little house punched into it. - Really efficient and friendly service. ÊThey were very accommodating of our large group. - Very cozy seating and ambiance. LAME: - They were crowded and we were strongly encouraged to vacate our table after the check arrive, which sort of sucked since we were mid-conversation. - It would have been nice to have the specials written somewhere on a blackboard or on a piece of paper. ÊEven the waitress had to reference her notes to remember them all. - It was uncomfortably cold in the restaurant. ÊSeveral members of our party kept jackets on. - Parking in this neighborhood is terrible though there's a garage about a block away. I probably wouldn't plan a trip back to The House, but I do recommend checking it out at least once.

New Years Eve 2011!! We ate the best meal of our lives at The House. We brought our own white wine (Viognier) which paired really well with each and every one of their appetizers! They had a $20 corkage fee, but their wine menu was accessible and affordable. We ordered almost the entire appetizer menu, mainly because we couldn't decide on just 1 or 2. They were all amazing: * Oysters- 5 stars * Hamachi sashimi- 5 stars!!!! So good!! * Kobe beef tartar - 5 stars!! Phenomenal! * Salmon roll- 5 stars!! Yumm * Steamed mussels and clams- 4 stars (only because I didn't like the okra texture in the broth-it made it a little slimey) * Pork belly- 5 stars++!! Best thing I ate all night! * Deep Fried Lobster Tail- 5 stars- yumm! Will definitely be back again!

My pork chop with pomegranate sauce was actually quite tasty. So why a 1 star review? Rude, poor service. Our server was impatient, combative, and argumentative. Twice she came to the table and we were talking and didn't snap to immediately, she left Êand once gave us the "Wrap it up" signal with her finger. She also argued with us about what was in a dish, and she grabbed a plate to re-do a meal while in mid-bite. When we complained to the manager the next day, Êthe waitress had already told her we were the rude ones (we weren't, I've worked in retail and I know from rude) and that basically she didn't need our business, she had plenty of regulars. Well, that may be true, but it's bad customer service. Nobody from our table of four will ever be back.

No Kobe Beef? WHAT, you took it off the specials? (booo.) I got over it. Ordered a fantastically delish Niman Ranch Pork Chop with Pomegranate Currant Sauce. Yum :o) Still one of the best places to eat in SF. The food is perfection.

My boyfriend took me here to celebrate our promotion, It wasn't what I expected as the place is small...literally..a house, but both service and food are better than most fru fru places in SF!! We ordered the calamari to start -- delicious. ÊSquid (or is it cuttle fish?) is kept whole, unfried, in a savory light asian sauce. ÊFor entrees, per yelp recommendations he ordered the steak, and i had the sea bass. ÊSteak was decent...but the sea bass was O--EM-GEE...best i've ever had!! ÊFish was so moist it literally melts in your mouth. ÊThe side of wasabi noodles was the perfect compliment. Ê Make sure to make reservations as seating is limited, I waited 45 min, but well worth it!!

3.5 stars Yeah the food was hella delicious, but it better be! Its like smaller than my bedroom and well, we definitely didnt come for the ambience. Ben and I came here on a Saturday Night, we found parking on Jackson and Stockton, hella far away (0.4 miles according to the gps). There is no parking anywhere in north beach so we trekked it there. We were seated on time...at 945!! Our original reservation was at 6 but they called back to "confirm" and ben didnt hear the call, when he called back the earliest time they had was 3 hrs later!!! Thats how popular this place is, so YES, make reservations. We tried the sea bass, and the wasabi noodles with flank steak. The steak was cooked just right: Medium well-done just like we liked and the sea bass to perfection. Presentation beautiful and we devoured our food. The food is super buttery so since everything was so dang savory we passed on dessert. Other: Large selection of wine. Bathroom is unisex and takes FOREVER to get into--they should make a VIP list for the restroom-il rsvp to that. I even gave up after standing outside for 5-7 minutes fearing the smell from the whatever the prior person was doing.

Came here for lunch as recommended by a good friend and was blown away by the freshness of every single dish! My foodie buddy and I ordered an enjoyed the following: Appetizers: -Fried Oyster Salad - Baby Greens w/Passionfruit Vinaigrette - Grilled Calamari Entrees: - Unagi Avocado Sandwich (comes with a side salad) - Udon Noodle Soup All of the greens, dressings, and sauces were incredibly tasteful and full of bold flavors. They're also very generous with their serving size (though you can never feel toooo guilty when a lot of it is veggies. Heh). My favorite: The fried oysters hit a home run! Least favorite: I wouldn't order the unagi avocado sandwich again; it was fresh but the textures didn't quite go together for my palate. Nonetheless, I'd certainly come back for their superb salads and appetizers. Final Note: Surprisingly small place yet easy to get a seat during lunch! Win win!

Alright so my last review got taken down because I was too mean to the hostess, so I'll try to play nice this time.. Food - Solid. Service - The House, like any other competitive establishment, should have a zero tolerance policy for their employees' mistreatment of their patrons. The attitude we experienced was jarring and completely unacceptable. Shame on them for deprioritizing the customer experience. Overall - Great food. Horrible staff. Your call.

This is my favorite restaurant in the whole world. ÊBar none. ÊIts unfathomable to me that anyone could give this place less than five stars, except those &*%$S in line who treat the staff rudely and cause the staff to give me their table. Ê Not a lot to add, but two things I cannot live without: (1) Tempura flash fried salmon rolls with wasabi-sake Chinese hot mustard and tobiko; (2) Sea bass on soba noodles with this amazing dipping sauce that somehow makes the fish taste like the best steak you've ever had in your life.

We came to House last Thurs, thanks to John G.'s glowing recommendation. WOW. Let me say it again: WOW. For such a low-hype restaurant, it completely blew us away. The wine wasn't spectacular - we got a Chauteneuf du Pape - but the food was WOW. We started off with Lobster Tempura in Baby Greens, and then shared the Korean-spiced Rack of Lamb and Grilled Seabass with Garlic Noodles. I mean, every individual thing was amazing, but the way that the entrees complemented their sides was sublime! Each complete plate was meant to go together, and its obvious that the chef gave a great deal of thought and care when dreaming them up. Dinner was topped by an ORGASMIC Scharfenburger Choco Cake with a side of vanilla-Heath ice cream. It almost put me into a coma. Even my date was bowled over... and he doesn't even like chocolate!

Just returned from my birthday lunch at The House and it was good, goody, good. This was my second visit to The House. So, I knew exactly what I wanted to eat upon arrival. But, my boss decided to mix it up a bit. So, since he was paying; I went along with it. He ordered some of everything on the menu. So, here is what I thought of it: Classic fried calamari: I thought these were OK...nothing special. Everyone else really seemed to enjoy them. Steamed mussels with garlic infused shrimp broth: These were fantastic and I am not even a mussels kind-of-gal. White shrimp and chinese chive dumplings: We ordered these. But, they never came. Deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard: Excellent! I wanted more and more and more of these. But, we only placed two orders. Dammit! Blue lake bean tempura with pickled ginger soy: These were OK. The other folks at the table thought they were the bomb-diggity...whatever. Tuna BLT with wasabi mayo: I didn't taste this. But, everyone that did really liked it. Unagi avocado sandwich: I didn't taste this either. But, everyone gobbled it up...must have been good. Chipotle BBQ pork loin sandwich: Look...I wasn't in the mood for sandwiches. I wasn't even paying attention to the feedback on this one. I don't do pork...anymore. Warm wasabi house noodles with grilled pork or with grilled salmon: Great! The Wasabi Noodles are the bomb-diggity. I would have liked the dish to be spicer. But, that's just me. I am a hot mama. Curry noodles with grilled chicken or shrimp or vegetables: I wasn't in the mood for Curry...sorry. But, those that were, eat every bit of this! Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy: This is super good! The sea bass was cooked to absolute perfection! Angus Ribeye steak with raw mushroom in a mushroom sauce: This was a special and it was Umm...Umm...Good! I loved it! Ten and a quarter stars!!! Whoo Hooo! Pumpkin Pie: Now, this was the Coup De Gras of the entire meal. I had to pull the owner aside (who looks just like Vera Wang) to tell her that this was by far the BEST PUMPKIN PIE OF MY LIFE!!!! And I am 37 years old now...I have had a lot of pumpkin pie! Creme Brulee: Was brought out with a burning candle in it (for the birthday girl)! Yeah...Happy Birthday to Me! This was Excellent! Made me think of HSM...if you don't know, check it out. My birthday lunch at The House was The Bomb!

This has been one of my favorite places for a long time. I order the same dish everytime I go - the kumomoto oysters with the spicy house sauce, the seabass ( that comes with garlic noodles that are borderline better than Crustaceans' garlic noodles) and the citrus infused creme brulee. The pomegranate pork chop is also very good! in fact, i've tried almost all their plates and have enjoyed them all. Thats pretty rare for a place to be consistently good on all their menu items. I only wish the place wasn't so cramped. When you are done eating, you practically know your neighbors really well since you are so close to them, it feels like you are a part of their conversations!

I had an amazing meal with amazing service here. We started with their barbecue mussels and one of their appetizer salads which unfortunately I can't remember the details of except that I was impressed. ÊThe mussels were juicy, tender and flavorful without being the slightest bit fishy. ÊI remember the salad being well flavored with a good texture component and a slight touch of truffle oil. Ê I had the Kobe beef for my main course. ÊIncredible. ÊDessert was amazing too. I had each course paired with a great accompanying wine.

The House rocks! My friends and I came here for lunch on a last minute whim. We called and made a reservation for 1:30pm, sat and ordered 2 pork chop plates and 1 pork loin sandwich. Delicious! I was on a pork overload. Juicy, tender and so flavorful. My friends swore that they've never had the most delicious pork ever in their life.

Why do I give this proverbial favorite of most yelpers only 1 star? Bad Karma or as Buddhist would say "no Karma". Ê When I arrived at the restaurant for lunch the first waitress smiled at me. ÊThen things started going downhill. ÊThe woman hostess was a little hostile and very defensive. ÊSince I know I am the Alpha male I just try to be as polite as possible since I do not want to be kicked out of this restaurant. ÊHer body language and tone of voice doesn't give me the warm fuzzies. ÊEspecially when she says "Do you want to see my appointment book!!!?". ÊBad Karma #1. I ordered the Mussels and the Sea Bass for my entree. ÊThe mussels were plated beautifully with a white sliced radish with caviar on top. ÊIt looked terrific. ÊFirst byte of the mussels were good it tasted plump and good flavor. ÊThen Bad Karma #2 struck. ÊExcept for the top 3 mussels on the plate that I ate everyone of the remaining mussels beneath it had sand/pebbles in it. ÊI would have sent it back except I already ate couple of them already. ÊI pressed on to finish my mussels. Just as I was trying to finish my appetizer since I was really only half done, when my entree of Sea Bass came. ÊI thought at a restaurant that charges $20 for a lunch entree would have the proper etiquette of serving the entree after the guest have finished with the appetizer? ÊAnyway I was hoping not to raise a scene so I ate the Sea Bass which actually tasted a little underdone. ÊI even remarked to the guys sitting next to me that the meat looked a little translucent. Ê Bad Karma #3! When I came back home is when Bad Karma #4 struck. ÊI was sick for the entire afternoon from the undercooked fish or something. Ê Well, that is how I arrived at my rating. Êminus 1 star for each bad Karma. ÊI am sure this restaurant isn't bad, however there is just bad Karma between us. ÊMaybe that is why I haven't gone to this place since it was at 9th Ave. P.S. After thinking about this I checked some previous reviews and found some yelpers had exactly the same comment I had. ÊWhich were "hostile" service and getting sick from the food. ÊI guess it might actually be this restaurant and not blamed on Karma.

I did not think I was going to like this place. I don't really like North Beach (too touristy and fake) and parking is a nightmare, especially on St. Patrick's Day. I figured "great, another overpriced Asian Fusion tourist trap". ÊBut, friends had arranged a dinner here, so I went along with the plan. You know what? ÊThe service was terrific, and the food was excellent. ÊAppetizers were pretty good but not exceptional. ÊMost of my dining companions had fish, but I wisely chose the signature porkchop with pomegrante sauce. ÊNever before have I spoken to my food, but I leaned over to my entree and whispered "You had me at hello..." But then I had dessert. ÊOh my. ÊI don't remember exactly what it was, but it's off the menu and reads something like "chocolate wahwahwahwah with wahwahwah-wahwahwah ice cream." I leaned into my dessert dish and sighed "You complete me."

Maybe I was able to unhype the hype about this place, or maybe this place was just pretty damn good, but for whatever reason I really enjoyed this place. Appetizer: I started with a small but very fresh tuna tartare, and the unagi with avocado sushi rice (read: dragonroll with high quality eel). Have fun trying to share the unagi because its not pre-cut. I attempted to cut it into pieces with a butter knife, which was as good as trying to cut it with the handle of my fork. Entree: Predictably, they had a miso sea bass, but for my entree I ordered the other white fish, a Black Cod special topped with a sushi roll. Holy bujezus, so good. The pomegranate currant porkchop, which I was highly skeptical of since the menu was primarily seafood, was SO moist and flavorful! The currant-pomegranate sauce was tastefully incorporated into the dish - just enough to add to, but not overpower the flavor. Dessert: The truffle cake tasted like every other flourless chocolate cake, cept with really good coffee ice cream. The mango tapioca was like the stuff you get at chinese restaurants, except it was DELICIOUS. Keep your expectations realistic, the servers are nice and food is fresh, pretty, and tasty. It's a cute little place (emphasis on LITTLE), make sure you have reservations and you all arrive on time so they can seat you. Parking is a nightmare, but save yourself $25 on lot parking and park on Vallejo and Sansome.

I like this place for more than just the name. ÊThe seabass was melt in my mouth gloriousness. ÊThe greens beans and garlic noodles complemented it nicely but they were hardly necessary. ÊI tried the quail and it was good but not something I would want again. ÊWe started with the scallops and they were perfect. ÊSeriously, perfect. ÊThe creme brulee and the chocolate cake were ok but not fantastic. Ê The restaurant is very loud so it was kind of hard to hear everything during our conversations and the waitstaff were competent but not friendly so it really felt like an Asian restaurant sometimes. ÊAnd like with any good Asian restaurant, I will not be deterred by mediocre to bad service if the food is tasty enough. ÊI'm a sucker. My overall enjoyment of the meal was magnified by my funny friends from whom I have learned new moves (can't wait to try them out), who steal my face and think it's a great compliment when I say they are not trolls. ÊAnd, no, I am not interested in the 5 year challenge since I'm pretty sure I won't last the year. ÊIf I do last the year, put me out of my misery, please. Thanks, chubis!

A-effing-mazing! Seriously, so incredible. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday last night, which was a nice change from all the down-home Italian places we've been going lately. The BF actually had to put on his "nice" shirt for dinner. And by "nice" shirt I mean a long-sleeved thermal shirt that looks like you should wear it under your ski clothes. So hot! He almost cried a bit when I asked him with a raised eyebrow if that was what he was going to wear to dinner. Anyway, we walked to The House and were seated at a spacious four person table, which I'm very fond of because you actually have room to spread out and put your shit all over the extra chairs. Big tables allow me to be the slob I am at home, but in public! The space is small, unpretentious and simple. The walls and floors are earth-toned, accented with these really odd small paintings featuring beast-type animals doing something that resembles a sex scene from hell. The menu is also very simple looking. It's a one-page laminated menu with food on the front and wine by the glass on the back. Right off, we decided to order a bunch of starters to share instead of doing main courses. The tuna tartar was succulent, light and refreshing, with a hint of citrus. It was sort of difficult to eat, but delighted my palate non-the-less. Next was the curried white shrimp and mango salad, which might have been the winner of the night. I still can't decide because each and every dish made me make inappropriate sex noises. But the shrimp was the best I've ever had. It was perfectly grilled and was so hearty that it somewhat resembled meat. The next three courses were a lobster salad and classic fried calamari and for dessert, a mango tapioca. I'm going to spare you the details because I'll basically be saying the same thing over and over, and boring my fellow Yelpers is a sin I'd like to steer clear from. The dessert was my least favorite part of the meal. It was cold, sweet and tasty, but paled in comparison to the other plates. The presentation is breathtaking. I felt a bit like a schmuck digging into the food, disturbing the beautiful art the chef had just created, but my oh my, it was well worth it once I popped one of their juicy morsels into my mouth. The House is definitely a must try! The main courses looked gorgeous too and I might be inclined to try one the next time I visit. The one downfall of the whole evening were our dining partners. The people next to us were having the world's most boring conversation at unexpectedly high decibels. Talking excitedly about the wonderful world of emailing, and a whole bunch of other topics I tried to block out. But even our dull-ass neighbors couldn't put too much of a dent into our perfect meal.

Not that The House needs anyone else to toot its horn - 540 reviews with a 4.5-star average screams statistical significance - but my meal last night was too good to keep to myself. The salmon spring rolls with some kind of wasabi sauce were the best appetizer at the table, and while others raved about the pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce, I prefered my (not on the menu) marinated grilled cod with crab sushi rolls. Ê Intimate atmosphere, friendly staff, unique menu options (come on - they offer an appetizer of grilled calamari with cherry tomatoes and benito flakes)...this place is worthy of its 26 rating on Zagat.

For years, Trick Daddy has been telling me to "Take it to the house, Take it to the house"! Ê(Betcha didn't know he was a foodie did ya?) Ê So finally I did and and what a House Party it was! Ê Like many House Parties, this one was: 1) Loud 2) Packed with people clamoring at the door 3) Young, mixed, easy on the eyes crowd and of course... 4) Booze (sake, beer, wine only - fancy schmancy cocktails need not apply). But unlike most House Parties, this one had: 5) Lots of creative, delicious Pan-Asian eats! I tried a bunch of their small places like the delectable oysters on the half shell (with a sauce that will clear your sinuses) and the yummy roasted unagi with a tangy BBQ sauce and avocado sushi rice. ÊThey had scallops on the menu that night. ÊGreat but there were only 3 teeny tiny ones with some caviar and a trio of make-you-wanna-lick-the-plate-sauces (including a yellow citrus-y one and a red spicy one). ÊI also tried the white shrimp and Chinese chive dumplings which were good but not terribly memorable. Ê Service was friendly and apologetic but harried and largely absent. (But that won't keep me from coming back to hook up with the tasty looking sea bass that was giving me the eye from across the room!)

One area in which House lacks is service. Waiter re-sets my table after appetizer. ÊOkay he forgot a spoon, I assume he left to get me one. ÊNope. ÊAnd the waitress didn't even bother to ask if we wanted anything to drink, and just gave us ice water. Bf and I revisited House for our one year anni. ÊI had the sea bass that is so very much praised, and bf had the oven baked monkfish in curry sauce with mussels. ÊFor our appetizer, we had the mussels in spicy miso sauce (special). Food was good, but not very memorable. ÊThe sea bass was the freshest/most perfectly cooked sea bass I had ever had in my life, and I was not really a fan of the bf's curry monkfish. ÊThe mussels we ordered though, were very good.

I found it a little difficult to justify going to an Asian Fusion restaurant in the heart of Little Italy, but it was definitely worth it. There are absolutely Asian dishes available, but we didn't really order them. I actually ordered the special: roasted quail over a creamy pasta with foi gras. Now, I love me some foi gras, but it's super easy to, well, screw up. This was delicious. The "creamy" sauce the pasta was tossed in was delicious -- savory. The quail was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Delicious meal! I'd love to go back and try other things on the menu.

On my second visit here, this place was as good as I remember it! I went with appetizers for dinner: the salmon roll (with very spicy hot mustard sauce) and crispy crab cakes. Both wonderfully delicious! The presentation of every dish is impeccable as you can see in all the pictures. The tuna tar tar was also great, as was the flank steak with wasabi noodles and the butterfish special of the night. Finished it off with some passion fruit creme brulee (which was wonderful and not too sweet) and the warm pear-blackberry crumb with vanilla ice cream. The most disappointing part of the meal was my fresh lemonade which was far too sweet. Overall though, a creative blend of flavors-sweet, spicy, creamy and tangy...all made up for the spice that our waitress was missing!

I'd love to give this place five stars for the food, but I'm an ambiance person. The rather bland interior needs a major makeover so that the decor is as exotic as the food. A few somewhat quirky things to note: 1) The waitress rattled off about TEN specials, apps and entrees both. And then she returned to add a few more...is the chef particularly spontaneous, or is the wait staff a little forgetful? In fairness, it's a long list. 2) The sake selection is limited and expensive, but the wine options are quite reasonable. 3) The restaurant is bustling and loud but the waitress never raised her voice above a whisper. As for food-related critique - my dining companion won in the app department with grilled calamari in a tomato sauce (one of the bazillion specials). I played it safe with the ahi tuna tartare and got...well, safe. The sea bass dish, which we both ordered, is incredible, and comes divided in exact thirds: equal parts noodles (amazing), some sort of spicey szechuan beans, and the most perfectly cooked, moist sea bass (with an amazing garlic ginger soy sauce). ÊYUM. Delish, and inches away from five stars if they'd only hire an interior decorator.

I've had the salmon, sole, mahi mahi, black cod and Kobe beef, and all were sensational. The quality and presentation of the food are always wonderful. Tip: Go for lunch on Saturday to avoid the crowd. We were there at noon on a Sat. and the restaurant was completely empty. Also, if you are lucky enough to be waited by the handsome lad, Louis, you will be graced by his cheerful and attentive service. What's most impressive is his recitation of the specials.

I could go on for pages on the many different reasons I am dissatisfied with this restaurant. However, I will try to keep it brief. This place has a super high yelp rating, so high and with so many reviews we just had to try it. ÊFrom the get go service was bad, are 9:00 reservation quickly became bumped to 9:30, not a deal breaker, but the service that followed cemented the deal: We were waited on to the most minimal level possible, moved during dinner (as in I had a fork in my hand and was about to eat my entrŽe) to a cramped table, and were left there until it was time to pay. If the food was phenomenal I might dare to venture back, but please listen to me, ITS NOT WORTH IT. Its overpriced, boring (the menu never changes really), cramped, service is rushed and unprofessional, and the cooking is really jus ok; I'ts not brain surgery to slab some meat with teriyaki sauce or throw some noodles and fish together. There are too many great places to dine at in SF, don't waste your money here. p.s If you like this kind of food, and I do, you can get it just as good for half the price with much better service over at Noodle Theory. It's literally the exact same kind of food (the chef worked at house for 11 years before escaping) but served for what its actually worth, and served with a smile.

I've been coming here for the past 4-5 years.. i live up the street. the food is delicious... especially the black cod special they frequently serve and their steak dishes. solid 4 stars for the food... Tonight I came with three foodie family members who were in town visiting from the Philippines. Now I rarely take the time to write reviews, unless I've had an especially good or bad experience at a place. Tonight at The House was DELICIOUS as always, BUT our waitress was probably the worst I've had in my 7 years living in the bay area. She was extremely rude to us from the start. She would roll her eyes when my family, who have filipino accents, asked questions about the specials. Funny.. has she not had to deal with foreigners before, being in north beach and all? Ê We tried our very best to be patient despite her EXTREMELY HOSTILE demeanor but nothing we did seemed to be enough to change her mood. We ordered a ton of food and wine and tried to ignore her awful manner. Did she not want us to order more?? I think we were way too patient for the kind of treatment we received. I don't have time to be more descriptive here and because I have been a fan of this place for a long time I will just say that you will probably have a great meal there if you manage to be lucky not to get this particular waitress. Hopefully I dont encounter you again. You need to leave the House and work somewhere low quality like your attitude.

I don't usually like driving around the North Beach area because parking is a b*otchhhhhhhhh!! BUT the House makes me want to come back again and again. I highly recommend this place. I found it cozy and the food is delicious. The House is a tiny little Pan-asian restaurant and usually full, so reservations are recommended. Prices are reasonable and it's a must to get the salmon rolls for appetizers and the sea bass for dinner or even the short rib if they have it that night.

Absolutely Infuriating. So, they serve until 10PM on most weekdays, and my party of three was running dangerously late. So I CALLED, and asked specifically what the exact policy was (did the kitchen close down early, etc), and TOLD them I was going to very close to 10PM. And I quote: " As long as you are in the door before 10PM and order quickly it is not a problem" Got there at 5 min of 10. ÊI say 5 of. ÊIt might have been 7 of, or 4 off. ÊEither way, the same person I spoke to on the phone stood there and told me their clock said 10. And I quote (again, the same girl who has spoken to me 20 mins earlier): "I know what I told you, but the kitchen has started to close down, and our clock says 10" Yeah. UP yours "The House" - thanks for misleading us. ÊWe could have walked in the door to an eastablishment 15 min closer, rather than trying to patronize your establishment. Won't make that mistake again.

Love this place! Although I was not particularly impressed the very first time I came here, it has definitely grown on me. Don't get me wrong, I LIKED the place, I just didn't think it was so-deliciously-fantastic that I would visit it EVERY single time I'm in town. To my great surprise, I have been here over and over, taken quite a few people here, and LOOK FORWARD to going here when I'm away! It must be THAT good! The interior is cozy - small, with light wood finish everywhere, and nothing jarring on the walls. The light is soft and yellow, which makes everything feel warm. The place is very small, so definitely call ahead for a table. I don't mind the crowded cafe atmosphere, but for some people it may be a bit too cramped. The food has always been great - fantastic fusion that is beautifully presented and DELICIOUS. I'm definitely coming back on the next fly-by.

The House in da house! There. ÊSomeone had to do it. ÊShit, Hitomi K. beat me to it. ÊAlright, I admit it. ÊIt didn't really have to be done, but I just couldn't help myself. Anyway, we pretty much just had all the fish we could find, definitely not a choice I regret. ÊI liked that each one came with a side of a different vegetable as well, without any less healthy, platefilling starches. ÊWe were all still recovering from Espetus the night before, so the lightness was much appreciated. Take away the bottles of wine we ordered, and the place isn't too expensive, either. ÊThrow in the bottles of wine, and you might gregariously bicker with your father and grandfather, then pass out and sleep like a baby at 9:30PM. ÊBut if your establishment of choice in which to drink said bottles of wine is The House, your meal may rival your sleep in satisfying comfort. ÊAnd since etiher way your girlfriend is going to call you at 10:30PM and yell at you for being asleep when she wants to talk to you, you ought get your pleasantries in now. Satisfaction guaranteed. ÊTumultuous personal life not included.

I was turned on to The House after I got a hot tip from a friend. The place has a very understated interior with a simplistic decor and cramped seating. The food is really the star of the show. It is Asian fusion (very original) but they do it better than any place I have tried. Their main crab cake is out of this world. I have eaten plenty of crab cake in my time but this one takes the taco. I would highly recommend you try it. The entrees are equally delicious. I have tried the Grilled ahi tuna and pork butt (Special of the night) and I was very happy. My friend loves their sea bass. Apparently it melts in your mouth. Don't remember too much about their desserts but good lord their food is phenomenal.

I've eaten at a lot of restaurants in San Francisco, at all different price ranges. ÊMost I tend to forget quickly after my visit. The House is one of the rare restaurants that is truly memorable. ÊEvery dish I've had has been either very good or excellent. ÊThe fried calamari appetizer is among the best I've tried (and I've tried many). ÊThe batter was just right, not overly greasy and amazingly seasoned. ÊThe sea bass is expertly cooked; pieces of it practically separate with a slight tap of your fork. ÊMy "American-style Kobe" steak was slathered in a delectable sauce and served with tasty Chanterelle mushrooms, and cooked exactly as I wanted it (medium rare). The only real negative of my last meal there was that the waitress spilled tea on my leg, which isn't the most pleasant feeling on a chilly day. ÊHowever, she made up for that with a complimentary and amazing custard pudding. With all of this and reasonable prices for the quality/quantity, The House is one of my favorite restaurants in S.F.

The wait wasn't so bad for such a crowded place (30 mins) but people! Please don't crowd the inside waiting area! Wait outside if its crowded and the hostess will come get you. I had window seat next to the door and there was always a crowd of people looking over my shoulder to see what I was drinking, eating or yelping. Not to mention the unwanted body contact. We got the grilled sea bass, miso black cod, deep fried salmon roll, and seared scallops. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented. But, if you're a fan of sea bass, take note that The House grills them.

I went here with some friends when I visited the SF a while ago. I didn't think much of the diminutive restaurant. It was packed and it took a while to get our table ready (we had a fairly large party). The waitress gave us the specials which included a galbi-styled Kobe beef with pickled cabbage (kimchi). I ordered it. I'm almost embarrassed to say this, but this little "Asian fusion" restaurant had what was quite possibly the best galbi-style meat I've ever had. Obviously they were using beef which most run-of-the-mill Korean BBQ's aren't known to use. The Kobe beef was exquisitely tender and perfectly rare. It was seasoned with the right balance of sweetness and saltiness. It almost melts in your mouth. Incredible. The kimchi that it came with wasn't bad either and rounded out the plate well. Some of my companions had the Angus flatiron steak with wasabi noodles. Very good combination of textures with the soft noodles and meaty steak. It was like gourmet comfort food. A few had some fish which was not bad either. I'm not sure when/how often they offer the galbi since it was a special. But I highly recommend it - if you find yourself lucky enough to be offered it. Service was ok, and the other dishes were good. Without the galbi, I would give this place 4 stars, so it's sort of a conditional 5 star. Yes, that's how good it was.

I mentioned passingly in conversation that I was going to The House for dinner to catch up with an old college friend. I got, "OMG I LOVE THAT PLACE!!!!!!" That happened twice in the same day. Before I went. Expectations were high. I was not disappointed. This restaurant does wonderful things with sauces without disrespecting the natural flavors the food has to offer. Their presentation is spectacular, and the service is really very good. If you have not been, this is definitely a restaurant to add to the "must try" list. I've met several people since who call this a regular spot when they have the cash. If it were a wee bit more affordable, I would likely do the same.

The House never fails, always impressive not only with the food but also with price. My lady and I came in for lunch during our stroll around north beach/chinatown. We had the salmon rolls which was very good, I'm sure most of you have had the salmon rolls, salmon rolled in nori topped with wasabi tobiko. A nice wasabi aioli which had a nice kick but ended with a soothing taste. I had the ahi-tuna blt, seared tuna with bacon. was delicious, a bit oily and messy but I didn't mind cause I would of licked my fingers if I was by myself but no I cant be embarrassing my lady like that. She had the unagi and avocado sandwich. geez they are so smart, knowing that unagi and avocado work well together and putting it together into a sandwich!! GENIUS! We both had this lychee drink, which has a big fat lychee at the bottom. Sure hit the spot~ Cant wait to come back again!

Food was great, more on that in a minute. ÊThe restaurant is Êbit cramped and it is LOUD! ÊMy wife and I went for our 5th wedding anniversary and we had a tough time hearing each other (and we are not old enough for this to be our ears). ÊI can't blame it all on the restaurant, we had 2 young ladies who were obviously much more fabulous that we are talking and laughing at the top of their lungs right next to us. Ê Ohhh, but the food. ÊWe had 3 starters. There was the tuna tartar which was not as good as Aqua's (not even close), but whose convenience was far superior. ÊThey actually put a small bite of tuna on a plate, place a "chip" on it, more tuna, another chip, more tuna, another chip etc. ÊThis made digging in a lot easier - no utensils required until teh very end. Then we had a special seared scallops with a lemon drizzle finish and they were Oh MY! ÊUsing the phrase in all sincerity - TO DIE FOR! ÊTHe most delicious bites I have had on my tongue in months - could not have been better. ÊDelicious. And, we also had the salad with crispy scallops (yes, we enjoy scallops). ÊGood - nothing special. For a main course, my wife had a special rock cod with a crab/avacado roll over the top. ÊDeliciously prepared and beautifully presented. ÊShe actually commented on how well it was presented - not normal so you know it was good. I had the special filet. ÊIt tasted really good, but my first few bites had both solid fat and gristle in them - not the best prepped filet I have ever had. Ê When I got past these, it was pretty good. ÊThe potatoes were OK. Then we had desert, my wife chose the apple crisp ala mode. ÊI had a Cherry/Nectarine Pie. ÊI didn't try hers, but she looked satisfied. ÊMine was incredible. ÊI love Cherry pie and this was a very special cherry pie. Highly recommended, bring a megaphone or walkie talkies.

The House has become my default restaurant for semi-fine dining that doesn't cost an arm and leg. I've been here too many times to count, enough times to have eaten 3/4 of the menu but apparently not enough times for the wait staff to remember my face. Dining at The House is quite an experience and here are some tips to ensure you walk away satisfied and content: Reservations - Make sure to call for reservations, especially on the weekend. If you have never been here before, be prepared for a small, crowded space where the tables are close in proximity and everyone can hear everything you say. As you can imagine, this place is not an ideal place for a crowd over five. Menu - Pay close attention to the specials of the day... all seven of them! The menu has not changed significantly over time so listening to the specials are key to understand what is in season and what is fresh. Sometimes I wished they would provide you with a print out of the specials as I often have to strain to hear all the details. Ê Recommendations - The lychee ice tea, ginger soy sea bass with noodles and green beans, mussels, pickled cucumbers (free) are staples and favorites of mine. Most often I order one of the specials but my default will always be the sea bass. Other - Parking is non-existent in this area so I would recommend walking, biking or taking a cab here. If you find yourself having to wait for your meal, take a walk across the street to Cafe Trieste and hang out there.

The House is a must try for any and everyone... The food was amazing! I went here for lunch with pretty high expectations because of the 4.5 stars after nearly 600 reviews and was not let down. We started with the mussels in a shrimp infused broth... which were excellent. My friend had the Tuna BLT which she really enjoyed and I went with the Beef Short ribs that came with mashed potatoes and green beans. The prices are just as amazing as the food an appetizer, 2 entrees and a beer came out to $36! I enjoyed this so much I may go back tomorrow! Update: I did go back the next day... and it was just as great! Each menu item explores different flavors so your meal is not monotonous. I could eat here everyday.

Our last meal of 2008 was lunch at The House-- well, unless vodka, pizza crust and gummy worms counts as a meal, in which case our last meal of 2008 was at the Bill Graham Civic Center-- but still, in either case, our lunch at The House was damn near perfect! It's definitely small and crowded, so reservations are the way to go, but the hostess is totally unpretentious and she and the wait staff did a great job making us feel welcome (they even had the table I had requested waiting for us when we arrived... definitely +1 star right there!). ÊThe food was incredible-- fresh, creative, interesting, well presented and mouthwateringly tasty. ÊA couple of standouts were the asian inspired fish & chips, made with golden battered black cod, and the pork sandwich, which was moist and tender and the perfect blend of sweet and savory. ÊFor dessert, the warm persimmon pudding was absolutely ridiculous (in a very good way)! ÊI will be dreaming about that stuff well into 2009.... All in all, just a fantastic meal and a perfect start to the utter debauchery that would ensue for the next 14 hours into the New Year!

Thoughtful. ÊArtsy. ÊBudding. Kudos to Chef Tse for great artistry in presentation. ÊWhether it's in height, bold colors, or edible flair, The House is definitely somewhere you can wow your friends by looks alone. From an outsiders perspective, The House looks like a fantasy wonderland, with the perfectly square window giving you a glimpse of happy eaters demolishing their beautifully crafted dishes. The neon sign whets your curiosity. ÊTake a step in and you're instantly welcomed by the warm buzz of the crowd and the smiling servers. Service is slow and the feature is always a struggle to get through (lengthy and oftentimes not well memorized), but you soon forget once the food hits. The warm wasabi noodles are subtle. chewy, and are a great complement to the flavorful peppered flatiron steak and its juices. ÊThe standout dish, however, is the savory Niman Ranch pork chop drizzled with the tangy pomegrante currant sauce. ÊThis sauce also pairs surprisingly well with the chunky mashed potoates. Appetizers are necessary to quiet growling stomachs after the inevitable wait, but are hum-drum and can't compete with the entrees. Dinner entrees average $16-26 Know Before You Go: 1. Don't judge the restaurant by its website... 2. Reservations only effective at least 3 hours in advance - may wait an hour despite rezzies.

If you don't have time to read the whole thing, just remember, reservations, not that pricey &really tastey food! First Impressions: So busy, so small. ÊOnly the yummiest restaurants in SF is this busy. ÊLUCKILY WE HAD RESERVATIONS! ÊThey sat us within 5 minutes. YES! Decor: ÊEveryone sits really close to each other. ÊReally small. ÊSingle bathroom. Service: ÊOur waitress was really knowledgeable; however, the food and service seem a little rushed. ÊI felt the food came really fast and right when we finished they took our plates quickly. ÊEEK! Taste: ÊCan you fingerlickinlicious? ÊBecause it was so good. ÊI don't know why the price is $$$, the dishes were really reasonably price. ÊThe food was so tasty. ÊSorry, I am drooling just thinking of it. ÊEvery item and flavor melted in my mouth. ÊFrom appetizers to dessert. Specialty: Their specials = good food. ÊJust kidding, I really wanted the black cod, but they didn't have it that day. ÊWe ordered two appetizers the unagi something which is really tastey and mushy like unagi, but some people didn't like the texture. ÊThe fried salmon rolls look better than they taste because the taste is slightly lackluster. ÊHowever, the entrees were so good. ÊThe pork chop and sauce was to die for, the sea bass melted in my mouth. ÊI ate everything, no left overs-- I wanted to say good bye to my dignity and lick the plate.

Great little restaurant nestled in the North Beach district (one of my favorite areas of the City) on San Francisco's oldest road. ÊVery good food, excellent and artistic meal presentation, good service, pretty good date spot, reasonable prices, and very close to some of the City's touristy and nightlife spots. If available, try the hamachi dinner special (when cooked rare the hamachi practically melts in your mouth with its tender and buttery texture), wasabi noodles with flatiron steak, caesar salad with scallops, and the mango tapioca dessert.

Tiny and cozy ... a bit too cozy. ÊI wish they had a bar. ÊIt was awkward standing/waiting in the doorway not up in someone else's face or in the lap of someone eating dinner. ÊLuckily they seated us pretty quickly. ÊThe place was packed on a Monday night ... but cleared out by 9:00. Having glanced at Yelp, I knew to order the sea bass. ÊIt was worth it. ÊGenerous portion of fish with sides of green bean and noodles. ÊIt was a lot of food and I didn't need to eat it all ... but I did. ÊWe also shared the scallop appetizer which was incredible. ÊI would order 3 plates of those for my meal next time. The meal was good and left me with a good impression of the restaurant but it was the delightful company that made it a great night. ÊNothing like catching up with girlfriends, swapping naughty stories and trading moves.

Overall excellent food, presentation, and portion. ÊI think where it lacks is the spacing and manners. ÊYou would think that with parking as frustrating as it is in the area, the last thing you would want is your food to arrive with some sour bitter attitude from waitress. ÊIt's sad that potential could be interrupted with this. ÊBut if you're as strong minded as me, and can separate between mind and mouth, you'll have a pleasant meal. Ê And as the family always does it, we get to try each others stuff: -Flatiron steak - good but not great -Grilled sea bass - My favorite by far and love the fuyikaki seasoning and sauce -Chicken liver salad - surprisingly good -Mango tapioca - interesting -Short ribs - This is good but it doesn't come with very much -Curry noodles - Something different from your usual garlic noodles, liking it! -Bitter chocolate cake with coffee ice cream - how could you say no??

Him: Where are you going to dinner on your birthday? Me: The House Him: Who's house? Your house? Me: No, THE House! Yes, THE House, the one and only now. ÊI had been to The House when it was back in the Sunset and I remember it been quite lovely...that was 9 long years ago. Ê This time around, my bf threw me a surprise birthday party here. The food was fantastic, for the most part. ÊWe ordered a couple scallop appetizers which came with a delicate lemon ponzu sauce....could have just slurped that up! ÊA few of us had the Alaskan halibut in a coconut curry sauce. ÊI would definitely recommend it...the meat was tender and cooked to perfection. ÊThe sauce was sweet and slightly spicy. ÊMy bf had the steak (which was solidly good, but missing a wow-factor)... I can't tell you how dessert was...because a friend brought an absolutely divine mango mousse cake from a bakery in Berkeley. ÊWe decided not to have cake at the restaurant because they apparently charge a cake plating fee...wha!?! $3 per slice....

I thought this place was OUTSTANDING. Honestly EVERYTHING stood out. We got a reservation about 45 minutes before we showed up. We ordered A LOT. The portions were large. Everything was incredibly tasty. It wasn't as noisy as expected. I LOVED the salmon spring rolls: mmmmm. The pork in currants was soooo good too. The sea bass was so delicate. And, even the caesar salad knocked my socks off. When can i return? WHEN WHEN WHEN?!

My sister and her husband's been coming here for over a year now and have always giving them rave reviews. Now I know why. This place is tiny but they make it work. We had dinner reservations last night. I think if you have to make reservations on a Tuesday night, that says something about the popularity of the restaurant for sure. We were seated immediately, and served water and menus. The wait staff were professional, friendly, and quick on the feet. Our appetizers came out less than 5 mins after we ordered them! OMG, that's quick! We had the calamari and the Tuna TarTare, both were delish! Portions were as expected for appetizers. Our entree came out soon after we finished our starters. We shared the Baked Sea Bass with ginger garlic soy sauce which came with these amazing wet noddles and string beans. This the the place where foodies come to convene and enjoy food that they are absolutely sure will be amazing. Oh, our dessert was creme brulee with a plum sauce. The most interesting way I've ever had creme brulee, the sweetness and sourness came together like an explosion in your mouth and makes you drool as you're eating it (does that make sense?)! Literally, your mouth will be watering while you have this in it, because the combinations of the flavors are so strong and contrasting.. Sounds weird but try it and you'll know exactly what I mean.

I've been waiting so long to come visit The House and I finally made it! The House has all the little details figured out, so you'll definitely enjoy your experience here. The space is really small, so don't bring a large group of friends here. The service was super fast--each dish was quickly proceeded by the next. I think this place definitely tops the list of places to bring a date -- cozy, intimate, but not pretentious (unless you were going for that?). Be sure to make a reservation because I saw someone get turned away at 6:30pm on a Sunday night. Onto the food: it was amazing! We ordered the lychee iced tea (they actually refilled it!), raw oysters, tempura soft-shell crab (see picture), the sea bass, and the special (black cod). Our appetizers came with the same sauce--an amazing blend of vinegar, garlic, cilantro, and siracha. It was great for dipping the soft-shell crab in as well as slurping together with the oysters. Even though I'm typically a spicy food eater, the spicy vinaigrette had me gasping for air! As for the entrees, I had the sea bass while the boyfriend had the black cod special. Both fishes tasted fresh and silky and the accompanying sauces didn't overpower the fish. My dish came with Shanghai style noodles as well as string beans. I really enjoyed the noodles as they were well made and not greasy tasting. Overall, a great night out. The setting of The House made me feel like I was on a third date (even though I've been with the BF for nearly 3 years). In total, our dinner came out to around $100 (tax + tip). If you're trying to impress someone, make a reservation at The House!

Excellent food, crowded, but great service! Recommended: MAKE A RESERVATION! WARNING: Even if you make a reservation, prepare to WAIT! The party that I was with had about 8-9 people. Unfortunately we had to wait a big even though we had a reservation. Be prepared to be squished by the doorway because there is absolutely no room! Many waited outside, but it was too cold to. While waiting to be seated I was impressed by all the dishes that I saw coming out. My eyes were watering and I wish I could order the WHOLE MENU! Unfortunately due to the small space, plan on being seated very close to the table next to you and watch your back when your trying to get out of your seat. This place needs to find an upgrade to the space because it has excellent service, food and ambiance. Service: If you bring your own wine be prepared for a $30 cork fee! Water was always filled and never made it passed half way. We were always checked up upon which makes for excellent service. Dish: Pom prime rib EXCELLENT!!! SOOOOO GOOOD!!!! I would recommend this one for sure!!! excellent taste, very flavorful and JUICY. The pom def added to the taste, not over powering either! In other words YUMMY YUMMY IN MY TUMMY !

Asian fusion?? Yes! SOOOO GOOD! We came here on a Friday night and it was packed! It's a really small place though, around 20 tables. Dishes Ordered: Ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips Roasted unagi (eel) with avocado sushi rice Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak Mushroom rice with grilled prawns Apple Pie Crumble with Vanilla Ice Cream Blueberry Pudding and Ice Cream TARTARE --- Never heard of it before, never tried it before, IT WAS INSANE IN THE MEMBRANE. The Ahi Tuna Tartare was delicious, the tuna was fresh sashimi. The roasted unagi was also one of the best appetizers I've tried in SF thus far. It had a real smokey taste with the unagi taste and the coolness of the wasabi. The wasabi noodles and steak was pretty good but had a little too much of a sweet tinge for me. The mushroom rice and prawns were so delicious. It had a strong taste of mushrooms (maybe a little too strong for some), but it went really well with the grilled taste of the prawns. The dessert was probably the best part of the night. The apple pie crumble was pretty average. The blueberry pudding was AMAZING, FREAKIN AMAZING! Seriously though, this blueberry pudding was like a cake almost, it was pretty thick and tasted so rich and wonderful. Pros: - Wonderful Food - Unique Menu - Great Service - FANTASTIC DESSERT Cons: - Kind of Pricey

This is how grown ups are supposed to have lunch. For only a few bucks more than a take-out sandwich, you can get a damn fine meal at House with white cloth napkins and everything! My coworker got a great-looking chipotle bbq pork sandwich and I got the curry noodles with crunchy chicken. Very delicious! Our bill was less than twenty bucks total for both of us, which is what we easily spend regularly on the greasy Chinese food around the corner from our office! I'm sure they are pricier for dinner, but at 8-10 bucks for a tasty, satisfying sitdown lunch, this place will easily go into our regular lunchtime rotation!

This restaurant has so many reviews; maybe it doesn't need another one, but I have to, I MUST, document my euphoric experience at The House. Me, the lowly part-time worker was invited to join in on the company lunch one beautiful day. I had no idea where we were going or what to expect as we walked our towards North Beach, quite possibly one of my favorite districts of San Francisco. Past the Church of Scientology, past City Lights. Enter THE HOUSE: a quaint little place, modern and yet with an old charm. ÊMaybe not spacious enough for big groups, but perfect for a date, or, as the girl sitting at the table next to us silently suggested with her Sherman Alexie novel in hand, a peaceful lunch. I became nervous when I realized this was an Asian fusion place. I had never been to an Asian fusion place that I liked. Their aim for ambiance and strong flavor never seem to make up for bad taste and price, but The House definitely made me shut-the-fuck-up-and-eat. Calamari, well, it's hard to fuck up on fried calimari. ÊThe bean tempura with some kind of special soy sauce was something incredibly unique, light in texture but strong in taste. ÊI tried the sea bass main course as well, cooked to perfection. But I think I probably died when I had the flatiron steak. ÊIt was presented beautifully and was absolutely delicious. Even the decorative shredded carrots at the top were good, and had a lovely "fried Asian" flavor. Yeah, I did die actually. The mango tapioca was hmm, maybe not enough mango, but still delicious in flavor and tasted like a much creamier, much richer desert that I might get at a HK cafe. Ê Service was really meh, but not a big deal. Homegirl was hella rushing us, not that there weren't any free tables that Friday afternoon. ÊShe was like BAM, here's your menu, BAM I'm back. Ê At one point the ever pungent smell of marijuana enveloped our table. My head shot up, and like a dog, I sniffed the air to find the source. It coincidentally arrived as a somewhat distraught looking waitress stood near us, but I'll more rightfully assume that it came through from outside. I mean, it is a small place.

Had the chance to check out The House when I took out some friends who were visiting from out of town. We got there five minutes before the lunch time rush on a MONDAY and were asked if we had reservations. We didn't, but they offered us a seat by the door-- it was a nice day so it wasn't bad at all. Five stars for the food and price. Well worth it and very creative menu. I had the Unagi BLT and my friend had the Salmon with Wasabi noodles. Both excellent. We also tried the deep fried salmon roll. A really great appetizer. It was salmon wrapped in seaweed, dipped in a light tempura batter, fried and topped with some masago giving it an excellent texture. Goes really well with the wasabi mustard sauce!! It got pretty busy and it seemed like only one girl was covering the entire place. She took my ice water at one point and didn't come back with it for ten minutes. She was really nice about it, but they really do need to make sure they're staffed! Someone probably called in sick that day-- but i'll have to take off a star for the funky service we got. I'll definitely be back to try their dinner menu.

Highly recommended. ÊNot only was this the location of an evening with friends visiting from LA, but here we shared some pretty darn good eats. ÊWe shared two of their special salads of the night. ÊA yummy butter lettuce salad with Asian pears, and a mixed greens beet salad. ÊThrow in the crab cake and the dumplings... fantastic. ÊNow that I'm thinking back on it, that crab cake was REALLY good. ÊI should have had more of it. I had their sea bass for my entree. ÊWonderfully seared, tender sea bass with garlic noodles (oh my) and greens. ÊSO GOOD. ÊHubby had a chicken dish that was a bit dry, but he said everything that came with it was so good, he didn't mind the dry meat. Ê Desserts included a yummy coconut creme brulee with a passion fruit syrup, apple crisp, and their special berry and nectarine crisp. I was trying to be good and saved some of my garlic noodles and greens to bring home, but my husband's fork somehow found its way to my plate - so no baggie to bring home. Ê:( ÊI guess we'll just have to go back!

The food here is AMAZING!!! The scallops and shiitake soup were delicious, and the cod (it was a special) melted in your mouth like butter. If you can't decide what to eat BECAUSE IT ALL SOUNDS SOO GOOD... go with any of their fish dishes...you seriously can't go wrong! Don't forget to order some lychee black iced tea while you're at it!

If you're craving wasabi noodles or sea bass from The House come on a weekend for LUNCH! The food is just as delicious, the plating is just as beautiful, the service is just as friendly, but you won't have to wait in line drooling! ÊTo top it all off, I believe the meals are cheaper as well (the wasabi noodles come with pork or salmon instead of flat iron steak during lunch - still delicious though). ÊOh heppy day!

What was I thinking? I have lived a block from The House for over 1,5 years and never ate there until this past Saturday. Oh, I did try.....many times, but the place is always so crammed and I am not one who enjoys lines, so I always left for a different place. Mistake I won't make again! My friend and I were lucky - we were on our way to the Greek restaurant next door, when I saw a little table for two by the window open at The House. I said "Maybe it's our lucky day"! And it was. We were sat right away and had a fabulous - and delicious - time! Appetizer: seared scallops. Cooked to perfection. I couldn't believe it could be beaten, but it was. My friend had the Angus Ribeye special and I had the Ahi Tuna. I really couldn't pick which one I liked best! The ribeye was melting, fabulously complemented by mashed potatoes, broccoli and mushrooms. The ahi came with jasmine rice, spinach and spicy mustard sauce. It was fresh and full of flavors. Pinot Noir and Sauvignon Blanc to match and we had the perfect dinner. Oh, and did I mention the presentation? It was also a big highlight of the meal. I would give 5 stars if it were not for the ambiance. It's a very small restaurant, and it feels crammed, especially with the eternal line waiting to be seated. You don't want to feel rushed while enjoying such an amazing meal. It also lacks charm and the right lighting, which definitely is compensated by the good service and spectacular food. I feel really blessed to have an amazing friend who treated me to such an incredible experience! And we will definitely come back - this time sooner and with a reservation!

Incredibly delicious food here. ÊCame here a couple of days ago during my visit to San Francisco and it happened to be recommended by two different sets of friends. ÊThe calamari we started out with was some of the best I have ever had, not too greasy, but with just the right amount of crispiness and flavor. ÊAnd my main course, the miso cooked sea bass, was incredible. ÊSo delicious. ÊI was like licking the plate, it was ridiculous. ÊEveryone else was very pleased with their food as well.Dessert we tried a coconut creme brulee with a passion fruit glaze, chocolate cake and an apple cobbler. ÊDelicious.

I love this place! ÊThis is the kind of food I could have everyday. ÊCame here for lunch with a friend. ÊA humble Asian-fusion find in the middle of pasta and stromboli. Ê I opted for the Grilled ahi tuna (seared) with spicy mustard aioli and their house udon noodles with a crisp and delicate junmai sake. ÊMost delightful lunch experience! ÊI believe my friend had the seared salmon over wasabi noodles. ÊWhatever it was, it looked delicious. Nice wine selection and service was warm and down to earth. ÊAmbiance nice enough and not too fancy. ÊThe little-kitchen-that-could pumps out dishes fast despite incredibly cramp quarters.

Our waitress might have been having a bad day, but she was not very friendly. After a terrific set of entrees, she tossed some dessert menus on our table and we noticed the Chinese almond cookie item. Below it read "for you to take home". So I asked the waitress if she would punish me for opening the bag and eating it on the spot. She said she would have to slap me and where did I want it. "Left cheek," I said. When she came back with our dessert -- a coconut creme brulee that was good, but not great -- she saw us eating the cookies and asked me if I was ready for my spanking. I said "Anytime." Then she pointed to one of her co-workers and said, "He's ready for you..."

Update Sept 07: Let me say this for the record. I've been to many, many places to eat, and I am often impressed with food establishment, more often disappointed... but THE HOUSE is simply fantastic. ÊIt's just all-around EXCELLENT food, terrific taste, freshest ingredients, etc. ÊAmbience is a little lacking for the 5-star rating I give this place, but overall - - the taste of Êtheir food wins the rating. AMEN! ****************************************** PERFECT. Seriously - The House is one of the best restaurants in SF. ÊTheir seabass is well known - and I had to try that, of course, but I tried everything everyone else ordered too. Ê(This is becoming a common theme, huh..... look what Yelp did to me!) ÊAll amazing. ÊIn fact - SO amazing that mid-meal, I demanded a plate switch to finish off the pork shoulder. ÊThankfully, he liked the seabass too, so in all of my feigned generosity, I offered: "Here, you can finish my seabass...." which worked amazingly well. Ê(OK, that, and the fact that he'd go to all lengths to keep me happy... even give up the delish pork body part!!!) All of it - great. Appetizers were delicious. ÊWe had at least 3 or 4 appetizers, and all of it was just perfect. Ê(This was a few weeks ago. ÊWith time, goes memory... but they WERE all amazing!!) Entrees were as tasty as anyone can ever expect. And add to that the price which was reasonable all around - - The House brings the house down, so to speak. Service was pretty good - - and ambience is rather nice and cozy, small but they don't seat you like sardines either, so that is good. ÊA good variety of alcohol was available from wines to Chimay beer. We were in a mad rush that evening - and our party of 8 were seated quickly, and served quickly too. (We had made reservations, though.) We were in and out within an hour or so and then off to the airport to end a wonderful and long weekend filled with fun. Ê The House was just a perfect way to end a memorable weekend - one that I will treasure for a long time to come.

Ê My buddy didn't know what to order so he asked the waiter what he recommended. ÊWaiter said the Pork Chops and asked if that was okay. ÊMy buddy being in a gambling mood, said, "Sure." Ê In the mean time, we had the scallops as an appetizer. ÊPhenomenal. ÊLight and seared. ÊVery simple. ÊDidn't do much and you never really need to do much to scallops for the natural flavors to come out. The pork chops came out. ÊWaiter did not steer him wrong. ÊIt was great!

Get ready to show your O-face. Outrageously good. ÊOne of my favorite restaurants in SF. I catch a lot of fish throughout the year so I almost never buy fish at the supermarket and I rarely order fish at restaurants... Chilean seabass at The House is the exception to the rule. Ê OMFG it is just plain delicious. ÊThe fish is cooked perfectly every single time.

Wow. The House is better than ever~ I've always thought The House was good but on my last visit it was absolutely fabulous! The FOOD is Êexcellent at The House: We started with the Seared Dayboat Scallop appetizer- they were cooked perfectly--a crispy sear on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside. They scallops were topped off with delicious micro greens in dressing. For entrees- the star of the night was the Kobe Beef Steak--it was truly the MOST TENDER and flavorful Kobe steak I've ever had, melted in my mouth. It came with chanterelles...which for some reason smelled and tasted like white truffle oil even though it wasn't mentioned in the menu...it was heavenly! The mashed potatoes it came with were just OK though. The Seared Ahi was also great- a huge portion of Ahi which was seared just enough to give it a flavorful crust, but still leaving most of the Ahi raw, just how I like it. The PRESENTATION of the dishes at The House is always stunning and dramatic- Thick slices of ruby red ahi towering over the garlicky spinach and rice, all topped with a mound of beautiful purple taro crisps. The Pomegranate Kurobata Pork Chop was good, nice and flavorful, but I wasn't wowed by it. (If you want a really great pork chop I'd recommend NOPA, which has a juicy marbled one). The AMBIANCE, DƒCOR, LOCATION of the House are not as fabulous as the food--It's really tiny and cramped inside, parking in North Beach sucks ass, and there's no valet. The dŽcor is simple and modern, but nothing special. It's nice enough for a casual first date though. The SERVICE is good, not over the top fabulous but friendly and accommodating. ÊI baked a cake for my BFF's bday (Nancy G) and brought it in- the owner said it would be a $3 per person charge for the cake, but in the end she didn't charge us which was nice! They brought the cake out with candles and we had the whole restaurant singing Happy Birthday to my BFF...a perfect ending to an awesome meal.

This place was so delicious. I ate here a year ago so I can't remember exactly what I got but out of the 4 dishes my table ordered (believed it was the sea bass, steak, ribs, and some pork dish), everything was great. It is a really small location and also pretty popular so come early.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out with over 550 reviews and close to a 5 star rating that The House pretty much rocks. ÊI'm not going to kid you with a in depth review since the other 550+ people already did it for me, but I'm going to point out a few tips and things you should definitely try when dining at The House MUST TRYS: Appetizer: Sea Scallops... they were like the size of my fist. ÊI believe they were a daily special, but if they're on the menu you have to order them. Main Course: Pork Chops with Pomegranate stole the show and was hands down the best entree (compared to the Salmon and Two-faced Tuna). Dessert: Creme Brulee - I'm not usually a huge fan, but it was so creamy and decadent that I couldn't pass it up. TIPS: - ÊThe House itself is about the size of a house for a leprechaun. ÊIf you don't like tight quarters then I wouldn't recommend dining here during busy hours. - Only 1... yep 1... bathroom for the entire restaurant. ÊAnd, to top it off that 1 bathroom accommodates both men and women. ÊSince we all know that men can't pee in a straight line it's kind of a gross experience for us females. ÊIn addition, there's usually a line for the bathroom on busy nights.

I've been here a few times and on all occasions the food was good. Definitely need to make a reservation on key dining nights, since this place is small. Great go to place in North Beach. Food is consistent and flavorful and I always want to change my mind on what i want to eat as all the food goes by around me to other patrons. I really love the texture of their noodles, they are always done perfectly. Only thing about this place that could change is the service. Like other Yelpers have mentioned, the service could kick it up a few notches and this place would be perfect.

I came here with my bf and another couple, and we all enjoyed this place so much! Luckily we made reservations ahead of time - if you do not - be prepared to wait at least an hour! Parking here is difficult, because its in between the north beach and chinatown area. But if you have patience, you can easily find street parking (free to park after 6pm). Started out with the shrimp and chive dumplings and the deep-fried salmon roll! Both were delicious! I wanted more! Two of us ordered the grilled sea bass, which came with beans and noodles, someone else ordered the warm wasabi noodles with flat iron steak, and we also ordered a special kobe steak that came over mashed potatoes. Of course we all shared everything, and it was DELICIOUS! I'm normally skeptical of pan-asian food, but this place does NOT disappoint at all. Prices here are decent compared to the quality of food you will recieve. Def. worth every penny! Not really a big place, but def. a cute restaurant to bring friends and family too. I will def. come back here because the food was fabulous!

The food was a full five stars; the price combined with the service and atmosphere dropped it down to only 4 stars. Ê The home-made noodles, as others have said, were outstanding. ÊI had the sea bass with them, which was cooked perfectly. ÊTheir mussels in broth appetizer was not revolutionary, but was quite good. ÊTheir pork-based main course with pomegranate sauce was likewise amazing. ÊThe two vegetarian appetizers I tried were well done, although it should be noted there are very limited food options for vegetarians in general. ÊFood was also plated with some nice touches, if you care about that kind of thing. Now some negatives: The service was reasonably attentive, but felt rushed and slightly scattered. ÊFor example, we were, we thought, ready to order before she told us there were a bunch of specials. Ê(Some of this may have been our fault; the fourth person in our party was a no-show). ÊPrices likewise were not terrible, but felt a bit high, especially on the wine and beer lists, which had markups that were ridiculous even by alcohol list standards. ÊThe place is small (a dozen tables?) and unfortunately, we got stuck with one of the four? in a narrow corridor between the kitchen and bathroom, somehow, which wasn't a very inviting space. Overall: I'd come back. ÊI love this style of food. ÊMake sure you have a reservations.

I love this place and what use to be on 9th and Irving. ÊAfter having the special calmari appetizer and sea bass for dinner, this place lives up to the hype. ÊOne star substracted for my friend's Burberry purse and another patron's Gucci purse being snatch be some shady folks that vanished into the crowd right by the door.

I'm downgrading this restaurant. ÊOf the three people in our party, two of us got sick. ÊThis used to be one of my Êfavorite go-to restaurants to take locals and out of towners. I'm thinking the duck entree was the culprit as it was the only dish that the two of us who became sick had that my healthy friend didn't have. ÊMaybe, it was just an off night for my friends and I. Ê I had to keep making mad dashes for the bathroom following dinner until the next day. ÊMeanwhile, my friend was throwing up on her plane ride home. ÊShe must have gone through three of those vomit bags. ÊImagine how horrid it is to be confined to your seat while you're feeling queasy and nauseous!! Ê(shudders) In general, I feel that the restaurant has not been as consistent with their food. ÊBefore writing this review, my friend and I have dined there on at least three separate occasions during the course of 1.5 months and we feel the food just isn't as good as before. I'm saddened to nix House off my list of favorite SF restaurants as I won't be stepping foot inside this House again.

A friend told me this was the best meal she had eaten in San Francisco, so we made a reservation to go with some friends on a Saturday night. ÊIt was unbelievable. ÊHands down one of the best meals I have eaten in the city. ÊIf judged exclusively on the quality of the food, The House only rivals Aqua in my experience. ÊEverything we ordered, without exception, was incredibly good. We ordered several specials, and based on our experience, this seemed like a good decision. ÊFor appetizers we had roasted calamari and hamachi sashimi, and for our entrees two of us enjoyed a blackened cod dish topped with a California roll, one of us had the highly acclaimed sea bass, and one of us had a monkfish special in coconut milk. ÊAll of the food tasted extraordinarily fresh, and it was perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. ÊWe enjoyed a reasonably priced bottle of wine, and finished the meal with the bittersweet chocolate cake, which was also very tasty. The food was so good at The House that I feel it deserves a five-star rating. ÊHowever, some diners may not agree due to the rather casual atmosphere and tight seating. ÊThis is not elegant dining; it's just a casual restaurant with incredible food. ÊOne final note: do not go to The House without a reservation. ÊWe tried to get a table without one on a weeknight, and the wait was nearly an hour, and we called for our reservation at about noon on Saturday, and 9:30 was the only time they could seat us, so plan ahead! Overall, The House provides a pleasant dining experience and phenomenal food.

The house offers some great American-Asian fusion dishes. The crown jewel of The House is definitely the grilled Sea Bass, which comes in an Asian-style soy sauce with sesame seeds mixture with a side of noodles and green peas. On occasion, they offer a grilled calamari appetizer in a tomato sauce. They bring the calamari fresh from Monterey Bay, so if they are offering it, then I definitely recommend ordering it. For lunch, they also offer some more affordable smaller plates including the very tasty unagui avocado sandwich.

Okay, so at first when i heard i was going to THE HOUSE, i did the looking it up thing online and honestly wasn't excited to be eating at yet another "asian fusion" restaurant because there are like...a gazillion of them out there. ÊThen my date and i get on our way we realized we were going to be late for our reservations and he thought, Êthrough referral from a friend, that this is a french restaurant. ÊSo, we were both a little flustered because of the traffic and thinking oh great, we thought we were having french food but we're really having asian fusion...how typical. ÊThen we get to the place and were brought to our table and finally i'm at ease knowing that after sitting in traffic, looking for parking and finding the place, that i was finally going to get to eat. Ê Our waitress comes over and tells me that she liked my shirt because it was very "chinese new years-y". ÊWhy? Because Im Asian and it happened to be CNY? ÊAt this point, i'm starting to think that this place is going to be a bust...but before long, our tuna tartare comes out and i'm immediately i got lost in its flavors and textures and thought my waitress' comment Êwas an adorable one and she actually was complimenting me. ÊI ordered the pork chops and my date got the kobe steak special, the moment i put that piece of pig in my mouth, not only did i forget about the horrible traffic we sat in, i was having a culinary orgasm. ÊTrust me, get the pork chops. The food here is so indescribably good, you just have to try it. ÊOur meal ended on another perfect note with the warm blueberry bread pudding that we got. ÊI have to say though, for as much as we were eating, we didn't feel disgusting full because the food wasn't greasy. ÊYeah, non-greasy asian food that tastes great. ÊYou just gotta go to THE HOUSE.

In honor of my FAVORITE restaurant in San Francisco: House do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height Thy salmon rolls reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of bean tempura and ideal shrimp dumplings. I love thee to the level of everyday's Flat iron steak, by sun and candle-light. I love thee freely, as wasabi house noodles strive for Right; I love thee purely, as your owner-chefs turn from Praise. I love thee with a passion put to use In thy outstanding sea bass, and with thy special, skate. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my finished plates, --- I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life! --- and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after dessert.* *Japanese pumpkin pecan pie and Coconut creme brulee with passion fruit

A place that would have 1667 Yelp reviews equaling a 4.5 star average at this moment in time must have something going for it. ÊI was ready to jump on the bandwagon and prepare the 1668th Yelp review for "The House" and pepper the review with "OMG! That was so good" statements and "I'll be back here again definitely!!" promises. Unfortunately I'm surprised that wouldn't be the case. "The House" was aiiight. Actually I was more disappointed. High expectations maybe? The pluses I do have are: Sea Bass. The sea bass was very good. It was good by itself: tender and juicy. But when dipped in the garlic ginger soy, the sea bass was now packed with flavor explosion: sweet and very savory. Second, I love how each dish that was served was beautifully crafted, where it would feel wrong to disturb such delicate masterpieces by sticking your fork into it. The minuses. I hate to sound bourgeois and all, but if I go into a restaurant planning to shell out $30 per entrŽe, I would hope for of a more unique dining experience. We sat in these cheap wooden tables and hard chairs that look like it belongs more in a deli. Not too comfortable, and it doesn't do justice to the food's well thought out preparation. Plus, it was dark where we sat. "The House" may call it mood lighting, but it felt like lights were turned off due to somebody not paying the electricity bill. Lastly, other than the sea bass, the other beautifully crafted appetizers and entrees tastes weren't all too impressive. We had smelts that that tasted like fish sticks, and the other dishes are forgettable. All this added up to be a boring experience. Overall, "The House" was disappointing. And I expected more. A "Yelp 4.5 star rating" more.

I came here on the recommendation of many family members because they swore that it was AMAZING! So maybe because I just heard people rave and rave about it, that I felt that my dining experience was so-so. The boyfriend and I came here for a special occasion and after a 2 hour drive, we were super hungry. For a Monday night, the restaurant was still super packed and I saw a line form as we got seated. However, the seating was HORRENDOUS. We sat so close to our neighbors that I could literally reach over and borrow their napkin, if need be. I didn't like how neighbors could hear our conversation and vice versa. I give the restaurant four stars based on the food. Granted, we were early for our reservations so we got a little buzzed at the place next door. So by the time we ate our food, I was eating solely for the fact that I was drinking on an empty stomach. I didn't even notice that the flat iron steak with wasabi noodles were rare when I ordered it medium. After a few bites I noticed that the beef was too red, but felt bad for asking them to remake it when I already ate almost half. We also ordered the calamari appetizer which had an amazing slaw on it. The slaw was the boyfriend's favorite and he couldn't get enough of it. However, the calamari was so-so. The portions were smaller than I expected and I didn't taste too much flavor to it. The bf ordered the sea bass, which was highly recommended by the family, and it was super tender and the green beans made the dish very bright. Overall, I think we should have switched plates because the sea bass was too boring for him and the wasabi noodles were too heavy and spicy for me. A big downside was how the servers bend down SUPER low to tell you the specials. The restaurant is soooo filled with close tables that it was hard to hear your server. Not to mention how uncomfortable they look bending down for such a long period of time. And let me tell you, when they tell you their specials it is SUPER LONG. I really REALLY REALLY wished that they wrote down their specials on a small menu because I couldn't hear our server and felt like I would've liked something better on that menu! I didn't want to make her repeat all the specials because I saw that she was in a big hurry to greet other tables. Sad to miss out, but hopefully I will come back and try more dishes!

Growing up SF, there are restaurants that you want to remember and there are some you just can't. The House is one of the places I certainly remember. I have only been to The House twice and both times I always remember their perfectly cooked, flavorful sea bass. It's been awhile since I have been down here. Since we were up North and it was near Christmas, I decided to make it a point to take hubby here for a nice dinner. I made reservations for 6:00, however, forgetting about the 101 traffic around that time, we were 15 minutes late. Usually, we would go around the city block until we find parking, but since we were already late, we just parked in a private lot paying $11 bucks! Since we were late, one of the waitress told us we only have one and half an hour to eat which is plenty of time for just for the two of us BUT what was funny is that, when she first told us, in a stern voice, hubby and I thought she meant we had to wait until an hour half later just to eat. I thought we were being punished for being late. Once we understood what she meant, we were seated. We were famished by then so we ordered without even relaxing. We ordered the grilled calamari salad (off menu item, special); fried salmon rolls; hubby had the sea bass and I had the mushroom risotto. Definitely, two thumbs up for the calamari salad; it was light, the calamari was so tender and the dressing was just on their right. I could have eaten the entire bowl myself. The fried Salmon roll was okay, it just tasted like anything that would be fried with salmon. I was disappointed when they were not flexible in changing the number in our party. I wanted to have my family there as well, but they couldn't do it. They had plenty of open seating while we were eating to the time we left, I think they could have easily made arrangement. My mushroom risotto was cooked perfectly with the earthy taste and flavors of mushrooms. YUM! I am salivating just thinking about it. Once again, the sea bass didn't disappoint, it was just like how I remembered. I had to have dessert after eating a great meal and decided to order the Kabocha pie; apparently it is a Japanese pumpkin-like pie but instead made with kobocha squash. It was lighter than a pumpkin pie, but still had the flavor and texture. It may be healthier than the American pumpkin pie since I think most of the ingredients is made from soy. It was the BEST squash pie I ever had. Till this day I am craving for more.

This is by far my favorite restaurant! I love ASIAN FUSION. I prefer their lunch menu over their dinner menu. My fave dishes for lunch are the grill chicken curry noodles - no bell peppers. I hate curry and this one I can only eat! Short ribs, mash potatoes and string beans are all so tasty as well. Appetizers I recommend trying are the spicy salmon rolls, the chive chicken dumplings and calamari. As for the dessert their items rotate but I suggest the mango pudding...nom nom nom! Service is great bc they are quick and your water will always be refilled. The complementary pickled cucumber are so GOOD too. What I love about THE HOUSE the most is they are always CONSISTENT! Make sure you call in for reservations because it gets pack!

The House is obviously quite pleased with their house noodles, which appear in pretty much all their main dishes, and I can't blame them. The noodles (which i believe are handmade) are thick, perfectly chewy with just the right amount of give, hearty and the perfect blank palette for their sauces including wasabi (their signature wasabi house noodles don't actually taste much like wasabi but is a pleasantly spicy, well seasoned dish) and curry (I liked this version better). However. What you MUST try here are their mussels, which are SWIMMING in a lovely Asian-flavored butter broth. It's basically a bowl of soup made with butter and some other seasonings that make it finger licking good, topped with a dollop of masago caviar. There was no shame by me or my dining companions in slurping the butter broth down. Not so good for the waistline or the coronary, but life is short. Eat butter.

This place reminds me of a mini Gary Danko. Nice, small cozy restaurant with clean interior design. Not good for large groups but great for a small gathering. With dishes created with great care, this place did not come up short. The wasabi tuna tartare with its unique crispy chips was delicious as a small starter along with the salmon fried egg rolls. Seared Ahi made this dish also special. The wasabi seared steak with soy-based thai-inspired udon noodles was my favorite as this dish will be the favorite of future patrons. Reservations are highly recommended as patrons were turned away for no reservations. Enjoy!

3 Stars SOLELY based on today's lunch experience. ÊOtherwise, it's a freaking 4-5 Stars place in my book. Service was good as usual. ÊToday I decided to FINALLY try the sea bass with HIGH anticipation. Ê$20 sea bass is not a bad deal at all for lunch! ÊPresentation was beautiful as usual. ÊPretty good portion of sea bass. ÊNice crunchy greenbeans, and flavorful noodles on the side. ÊSea bass was cooked with slight crunch on the surface, flakey in the middle, LOOKS GREAT! HOWEVER, the dish was EXTREMELY oily. ÊSea bass wasn't seasoned enough because I'm supposed to dip it in the sauce that it came with. ÊHowever, the sauce was overly salty. ÊEven a very light dip was pretty overwhelming. ÊThe fish was probably seared with lots of oil, and remember, sea bass is an oily fish. ÊEverything came out to be super oily. Ê Pretty disappointed this time. ÊI guess I'll just stay away from the sea bass.... ÊWHAT?! ÊYep, sounds like non sense, but I like the flank steak WAY better.

Talk about a great find in North Beach. You may think that North Beach is lined up with Italian Restaurants Galore, but you're wrong if you haven't stumbled upon "The House" located kiddie corner from the main drag of Columbus Ave. The best way to describe this place is Asian Fusion. It's a rather small space so make sure you make reservations in advance. We went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the place gets packed...and for a good reason! We had a delicious mushroom soup that hit my palate just right. Followed by Ahi Tuna Tartar, Fresh Oysters (which were to die for) and Pork Noodles. What's great about this place too is the way they present the food (talk about artistic perfection). The food is plated with the precision of a Michelin rated restaurant. An absolute great find in a rather unusual setting Italian setting. But come to think of it, since Chinatown is just a hop skip and jump away Chinatown visitors looking for a taste of Asian Fusion may find just what they're looking for when they come "The House."

BLACK COD OMG. okay, just had to get that out of my system to start with. So I came here with no reservation (they don't take reservations by phone, I was told? hm...ok...) expecting pretty much to get turned away but they had a 30 minute window for a table for 2. Despite their wanting to rush us out, the waitresses were very nice and attentive. Brownie points for the house! We tried the black cod and the sea bass, both suggestions from fellow yelpers, and mango tapioca for dessert. The sea bass was tender as everyone has said, but it didn't knock my socks off. The chinese veggies it was served on were very salty, but the avocado sushi rolls that came on top were interesting decoration and provided a nice (blander) flavor to complement the black garlic sauce on the plate. The black cod was the better dish by far, with crispy slightly burnt outer edges and juicy melt-in-your-mouth type meat underneath. It kind of reminded me of a similar dish at Mantra down in downtown palo alto, except the dish at the house was even juicier. If this is a special that is on the menu when you visit, order it! Dessert was mango tapioca, which I actually really liked. The mango sauce on top provided a nice sour flavor to offset the sweetness of the tapioca and the whole thing was light and not too syrupy sweet. Next time I'd like to try the coconut creme brulee with passionfruit puree. Lychee iced teas were delicious too, with free refills that our waitresses kindly supplied whenever our glasses were drained. Our bill came out to around $70 for two people, not too bad for a delicious meal. Reasons why it didn't get 5 stars: parking was a bit hard to find, the place was small and even though the waitresses didn't rush me, I felt obligated to chew faster, and the sea bass was good but not amazing. If I am in the North Beach area I will definitely try to stop by again, and probably make reservations in advance next time!

Went there for lunch, food is not bad, servers are well trained. But they don't handle the rush well. The male server who was excellent explaining us the specials and other things on the menu was clearly stressed out and took it out on me at the end of our other wise great lunch. I brought the check book with our credit cards inside to him. I was being polite about it, seeing that they were busy and didn't mind that they didn't have the time to come get it. The male server who was great earlier now not so much said "MISS!!!" to stop me from going back to my table and went on to say "for YOUR future reference, put the card in the slot on top of the check presenter so that we know you are done. So that we don't have to rush you." I could not believe that he had a nerve to tell me where to put my credit card in to pay them. We had them inside the book. So because of that we will never go back there.

I rarely go out to eat, because I'd almost always rather spend that money on new music than food. When I do want to take someone out for a nice meal, my first choice is always The House. The food is Asian fusion that really works and is prepared by a family that takes pride in their menu. Ê Almost everything is a sure bet, but you should have the sea bass on your first visit. Honestly, don't look at any other entree, just order the sea bass and thank me later. Every time I visit here, it reminds me why it's worth going out to eat. Ê One disclaimer: if you're looking for a romantic dinner with privacy and space, this is not a good choice. It is a small restaurant, tables are close together, and privacy is difficult to obtain. Go for the food, not the ambiance.

My good friend DD took me here and she and I have had mixed reviews on places we've gone. It was mainly the time we went to Isa on Steiner. Sea Bass was very good. Great flavor and the meat is very tender and breaks apart in your mouth. Worth getting again. Ribeye was okay. Very well cooked and very nice cut of meat. Flavor was a bit bland. Would probably get something else next time Sea bass is definitely worth trying here though. We took it to go since they were closing up. But they were very nice and gave great service while we were waiting.

This place was good but... quite honestly its just normal catonese food + some other stuff presented in a westernized manner. It tastes just like stuff I usually get at chinese restaurants. I was all excited to try this place because it got rave reviews but I found it just...very canto tasting. (yes I am cantonese btw). I guess I was hoping for some unique flavors. Not chinese food presented prettily on a plate. The pork chop was definitely stand out though. But everything tasted like stuff i could get in Chinatown down the street...albeit it was good tho. and it was expensive too compared to the amount you get at a chinese restaurant... I guess this is def a good place for westerners to get their feet wet in authentic chinese food without being scared by all the asianness of a real chinese restaurant. Two glasses pinot noir, 1 coke Got shrimp and chive dumpling Crab cake (yummo!!) Sea Bass Pork Chop Ahi Tuna Coconut creme brulee with passion fruit ( could not taste the coconut at all but the pasion fruit was very strong) $140 (tax + tip included) Are any other chinese people with me on this one?

Great restaurant. ÊI came here with some friends the other night. ÊThe crab cakes were awesome, some of the best I've ever tasted. ÊWe also ordered the black cod special and the pork chop with pomegranate sauce. ÊThe cod was alright, light and tasty and served with a avocado roll, but I'm not sure I'd give it another go.

Entrees were around twenty to twenty-five bucks, not too bad considering the quality of the food. ÊParking (anywhere in North Beach, really) is definitely a hassle, so give yourself at least 15 minutes before your reservation to find a space. Would I ever come back to The House? ÊThat's a definite yes.

I ate here for probably my 5th time this weekend to celebrate my Mom's b-day. ÊFood was delicious as normal. ÊThe menu is reasonably priced and makes for a good celebration or date restaurant. ÊDefinitely good value for your money! ÊA hidden gem if you will. ÊBe sure to make reservations! We started out with a soft shell crab and chicken liver with mixed greens appetizers. ÊNot a fan of chicken livers but everything else was great. ÊMy Mom and Brother got seared albacore tuna with mustard sauce and a California roll on top. ÊMy Dad got the amazing wasabi noodles with flank steak. ÊI ordered the sea bass in ginger soy marinade which came with garlic noodles and string beans. ÊEveryone was very satisfied with their orders. ÊService was great, food came out quick and everything that should be was piping hot! ÊWe were in and out in 40 minutes...really excellent for a restaurant of such caliber. It's really close to North Beach so perfect if you want to have drinks after/before. ÊCheck it out!

I knew this place would be something special as it hadn't received a single negative Yelp review from anyone with a remote sense of taste, and it was the favorite restaurant of a local we came here with for their birthday. Wow is all I can say about the cuisine here - especially the seafood. I ordered a tuna dish cooked perfectly with fresh ingredients and lots of flavor. The whole night was an excellent experience and one that is deserving of five stars after a first visit. Possibly one of the best "fusion" dining excursions ÊI've ever been on. Tips: You can BYOW with corkage fee and it's a small place so reserve ahead.

"The House," is my favorite house (restaurant). ÊNestled in the uber-trafficy Chinatown (North Beach area), tourists and non-tourists alike will find their taste buds enlightened and satiated. Ê Parking is a pain, but there is a parking lot about 2 blocks away. Ê Pros: ÊTasty, seasonal, seafood-ish entrees. Ê Cons: ÊCrowded seating/small venue. Bad for groups, but delectable for an intimate date for two. ÊMy partner and I call this place our foody haven. ÊMy favorite is the Grilled Sea Bass with Garlic Ginger Soy. ÊThe fish melts in your mouth, the noodles are perfectly gingery and soyful without being too over-powerful or MSG infused. ÊYou'll want seconds and perhaps thirds. Ê Highly recommended.

What a great yelp find! Our server gave us excellent wine suggestions and I enjoyed how the waitstaff here pitched in and helped each other out. Everything was good here, both the unagi and tuna appetizers were very tasty, I liked the BBQ Unagi just slightly better, I've never had unagi served up like that before. I got the Sea Bass and it was so good! ÊThey also give a good portion of sides of green beans and fancy chow mein noodles. I tried a bite of my boyfriend's steak and it was seasoned to perfection. Also no heat lamps here! ÊThey serve it to you fresh out of the kitchen. Oh yeah and don't forget to make reservations! ÊThis tiny spot fills up quick!

If only it wasn't so busy and cramped, it'd be getting 5 stars. Location is perfect - it's a refreshing alternative to a very Italian area where you don't feel compelled to order something with to much carbs - like pasta and breadsticks. Everything was so fresh and great tasting... even the sliced cucumber/onion salad first course was great. I had the salmon that was so gorgeously presented and created. The flavor was fantastic. That wasn't even the best part either... I had the most amazing creme brulee here it was pleasantly surprising that a restaurant with a lunch-spot atmosphere could do a midday meal so well. The service was impeccable, the facilities were spotless and it's got a cute little bistro feel to it. One set back though is that it's not the cheapest lunch in the city... but you get what you pay for.

A small restaurant that can get very crowded, but well worth the wait. I suggest making reservations. Decently priced and portioned. Friendly waitstaff. My favorites of the night were the oysters, mussels, the crab cake, the wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak and the, and the angus ribeye steak. For seafood lovers, I recommend the sea bass with garlic ginger soy. That soy has a nice kick to it. For desserts, the winners were the chocolate truffle cake and the persimmon pudding (the night's special). But really, you can't go wrong with anything you order here. This is one of my most favorite restaurants. JONASAPPROVED!

He says : Thanks to a review from "check please bay area" and the fact that it was close to the jazz club Pearls, we decided to check out this restaurant on a Thursday night. Ê We came in early - about 6:15 - and there was only one occupied table. ÊIt did get crowded around 7 pm. ÊThe decor isn't anything special but the food was spectacular!! Ê We had two appetizers - one was the salmon skin roll (which was GREAT with an awesome hot mustard sauce) and the tuna tartare. ÊPresentation of the dishes were awesome - the dishes looked almost like art. Ê For our entrees, I had the sea bass (cooked to perfection, great sauce, lots of sides - noodles and green beans) and "she says" got the noodles with beef. ÊInteresting note : Êthe noodles were the same as what I had in the sea bass and the slaw that it came with was the same that came with the salmon skin roll. Service wasn't bad although one of the waitresses was a little rough around the edges. Final verdict? ÊWe'll be back and we'll probably try more appetizers less entrees. She Says: Mmmm... It's been a few weeks but the House left a strong impression on me. ÊYUMMmmmm.... It's not a hole in the wall in the traditional sense. ÊIt was small and the decor sparse but not a run down joint like the term may suggest. The food was delish... as He Says took the words (and ideas) out of my mouth. TRY IT...!

Full disclosure: I went in here knowing the place had got some mean stellar reviews from some very, very respected yelpers- but walking in, I wasn't so sure. Maybe its the...well...spartan interior. The menue seemed fusion-ie, but nothing crazy jumped out at me. That is, until I tried the first bite. oh. damn. The chicken with black mushroom sauce was a roundhouse kick full of flavor- with a dragon punch full of awesomeness. Juicy, moist and tangy- it wasn't like anything else I had ever tried. The juicy, nummy sauce was a perfect compliment to it- now the final test- the starches! And the potatoes rocked! Not dried up, not too gooey- just that perfect middle ground. ÊEven the veggies were cooked to perfection and kids, I NEVER EAT VEGGIES. I always thought I was alergic- well, i'm rethinking that right quick. It was a great meal and i'll definitely be back, Êwith a not-so-spartan appetite ;)

If Asian Fusion food is your thing, this place is worth trying. For appetizers, the Oysters on the half shell, Ahi Tuna Tartare, Steam Mussels, and the Deep-fried Salmon Roll are a good choice! ÊFor an entree the Sea Bass was my favorite. Their wine list was also decent. There was even a selection of Sake! ÊRemember to leave room for desserts w/coffee or a dessert wine. Surprisingly, the coffee was strong and flavorful! The House gets really crowded and noisy on Fridays & weekends. So make reservations for an early dinner, and DON'T BE LATE! ÊDinner on a week night is a little less crowded, but not by much. The staff try their best most of the time, but sometimes, they get a little stressed by diners who are late or staying longer than usual. All-in-all, it's about the food, and it was worth the hassle, noise and tight space.

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM Thank goodness this was on compny dime - even for lunch it was pretty pricy. Efficienct service, DELICIOUS food. And to top it off - their special for the day involved seared tuna - LOVE IT. ÊWhen I asked for said tuna on top of greens salad, they accomodated with only slight hemming and hawing. Probably the best lunch I've had thus far in the city - I think it was a shiitake mushroom bisque I started with - with truffle oil. ÊThen, aforementioned salad with passionfruit - are you kidding me!? and seared tuna. ÊSooooooo good. I think for three of us it was in the $60 range before tip - not outrageous, given the ingredients, but not a daily spot either.

Best Asian food in San Francisco! I have to say that this is the best Asian food in the city. I can remember alot of memorable places, but when it comes down to price, quantity, and quality House has got the best overall value. The 3 mainstays that you can never go wrong getting are the 1. Fried Salmon rolls w/spicy mustard sauce: I love how the outside is crispy while the soft cooked Salmon just melts in your mouth. To describe it imagine eating a salmon flavored M&M, but instead of sweet it was indelibly salty. 2. Unagi Avocado Roll: Again this appetizer is so good!!! With its flaky crust and soft morsels center, the salty fish and soft avocado melts all the way down your throat. Its nothing like your typical Unagi rolls where the rice is slightly heavy and hard. The softness of the fish and rice gives you a light and delicious flavor. 3. Special: Butter fish with blue tail tuna sashimi: OMG this is the best seafood dish I have ever tried. From beginning to end the taste was phenomenal, I let out an OMG after every bite. The butter fish is slow cooked keeping its soft texture, but long enough to provide a perfect crispy taste. The sashimi serves as a perfect complement to the dish providing a perfect contrast between the both styles of serving a delicious fish. This was to die for. *FYI: This dish is served on different nights with a variation of hamachi or tuna, but I recommend getting it when its the Butter fish* You will love this restaurant! just remember to ask for chopsticks, it makes it easier to eat.

In two visits, I have decided that this restaurant is one of my favorite places to eat in SF when I want a nice sit-down meal even though the prices are a bit more than your average day-to-day meal. Ê The black cod special was so #@%^! delicious; I ate every last bite (besides the bites that my boyfriend snagged from the plate). ÊAnd the rice they use for their sushi? ÊSurprisingly the best sushi rice I've had in a long time - perfectly cooked and slightly vinegary just like it's supposed to be. Ê I'm already dreaming of the next time I'll be back.

It's all about the faces, people... We enter through a small door into a restaurant that looks unnervingly drab. ÊDecor is clean, but somewhat dark and muted. Ê"Should we eat here?", we asked ourselves, "maybe not..." Êbut ÊWAIT!! Look at the people's faces! ÊThey were glowing with satisfaction! ÊEveryone was wearing a smile and enjoying their dishes...//...And off to a table we went... The tables are small, and so is the menu, but for a restaurant of its size, its certainly not bad. ÊService was pleasant, but curt. ÊNothing special by any means, but nothing bad. ÊThe highlight was the food itself. Ê Some of the standout dishes were: Ê *Broiled Unagi with avocado sushi rice. ÊThis was just great; not for the "wow" factor, but just because it was plain good. ÊThe eel was smokey and charred and went perfectly with the sushi rice and avocado. ÊThe flurry of bonito shavings was a nice touch. ÊIt was quite comforting, especially in this December weather. *Seared Scallops with lemon-ponzu and micro-greens. ÊAnother great dish- the scallops were nicely caramelized and perfectly rare on the inside. ÊThe lemon sauce (not a ponzu...no soy to be found) was nice, and the micro-greens had some sort of orange dressing. Ê *Pan-seared duck breast with blackberry sauce and mashed potatoes. ÊAmazing!! ÊThe duck was nice and juicy, pefectly medium-rare, and was paired with an awsome blackberry reduction. ÊIt wasn't too sweet or too fruity like some duck sauces. ÊA few warmed berries finished the dish. ÊA simple, but well-prepared dish. Ê We also had Oysters roasted with a chipotle BBQ sauce and cilantro-onion relish. ÊThis was just ok. ÊI really couldn't taste the Oysters at all because the sauce was too overpowering. ÊIt would be better on shrimp or something with more flavor. Ê(There was at least a good tablespoon of sauce per oyster. ÊA teaspoon would easily have been enough for these bivalves...) *Mango Tapioca Pudding- GREAT dessert! ÊThe pudding had no mango flavor itself; instead, mango puree was poured over the top. ÊThe pudding was extremely well-made: rich and insanely creamy. ÊWe could discern a hint of almond flavor in it. Ê I highly reccomend you stop in when you are in the mood for a great, but fairly quick meal. ÊYou shouldn't be in here for more than 1 hour. Ê1.5 max. ÊThere is really no ambience, scene, or service to be relished- just good food.

OMG. This place. The House. The best place in the area. For real. I took my beautiful girlfriend here for her 19th birthday. AND SHE LOVED IT. What's better is that I LOVED IT TOO. We couldn't believe the flavors that flowed into our mouths as we sank our teeth into their delicious mussels/calamari/angus steak/chicken breast. The mussels were amazing! The calamari was super tasty! The angus steak was cooked to perfection and was overflowing with juices. AND OMG THE CHICKEN BREAST WAS TO DIE FOR. So much good sauce poured all over the plate; I had to lick it all off. My plate was so clean they didn't even need to wash it. As for my baby, she loved the steak. Damn their steak is good. I loved seeing her excited eyes when I told my girlfriend that I was taking her to THE HOUSE(is on fire!!!) for her birthday. On another note, service was not up to par with their great food. Our server was tough to understand as she ran through the specials of the night. Also, we felt like we were being neglected due to the fact that we were basically "kids" in there. Some of the staff were forgetful in bringing us menus when asked as well as our server when we were ready to order. I made reservations close to two months in advance (just to be safe) but have not even received a confirmation call or anything, which made me kind of nervous on the drive across town for dinner. Very well recommended. Very good food. Very good times. A visit to The House is a must. They also have the cutest paper placemats with little cartoon houses punched out. It just adds to the fun!

I rarely give out five stars but this place deserves it. When people ask me where they should go out to eat in North Beach I always tell them The House regardless of their want of Italian food. ÊI've been here over 6 times and have always been impressed. ÊEspecially when there are so many other places to try. This place is too great and consistent to have someone pass it up for Italian. ÊThe portions are perfect and it is reasonably priced too. ÊTheir food is flavorful, fresh and delicious. ÊI order the black cod with Chinese broccoli and a sushi roll. ÊEXCELLENT. ÊMy dinning guest ordered the bass which was cooked perfectly with a side of fresh green beans and noodles. ÊDessert was Coconut Creme Brule. ÊStart cracking that sugary top! The wait staff is humorous, courteous and on point. ÊYou'll be amazed no only by the food , but Êwhen they recite the specials from memory. ÊI was going to ask the waiter to repeat it just for fun. ÊIt's a bit tough for larger groups of 5 or more. Hints ==== *A reservation is a must when coming here, but you can get lucky *Park in the public lot on Vallejo btwn Columbus & Stockton as street parking=tough *Make sure you leave room for dessert..... I only say this as I like dessert ;o) *Good place for a date (bring a hot one) *Large groups should make a reservation and have a early dinner to minimize waiting. *It can be loud at times in the restaurant. ÊSitting in the back alleviates this a bit. *Wheel Chair accessible but you just have to get the chair over a small 4inch lip.

Lordy! This place was insane, in a good way. It is very small and I would recommend making reservations in advance. In addition, go with someone that you are comfortable intimately talking with because it is loud in this small delightful fusion restaurant. In terms of the menu I would highly recommend the sea bass and kobe steak. The presentation is artsy, yet fun. And eating the meal is a journey into the complex and flavorful. The bass is beautiful to look at and tastes Êbeautiful in your mouth. The Kobe steak was cooked perfectly and sauce was delicious, but did not over power the tastes of a quality steak.

This was one of the first Asian fusion restaurants in the City. The sea bass entree was the most memorable, and it's still on the menu. Five of us came for lunch today. We came specifically for the unagi sandwich. A fillet of unagai on grilled buttered bread with avocado, lettuce and tomato. Served with mixed green salad. I'm going to try to duplicate the unagi sandwich at home. We started with the deep fried calamari. Although it appeared burnt, it didn't taste burnt. Served with shredded slaw and a nice dipping sauce. The restaurant was packed during the lunch hour, but our food arrived within reasonable time. Major con - the noise level because the spacing is very tight. You don't have to try very hard to hear other people's conversations.

After eating at several Asian fusion restaurants across the country, I highly recommend eating at the House. ÊThe dishes were creative and delicious.

ÊThis restaurant is a true San Francisco treat. ÊThe ambiance is simple and clean. ÊThis was perfect for an anniversary dinner. On the night my husband and I dined, an Asian female food server (with the ponytail) provided an elaborate detail of the specials for the night and of the menu. ÊHer knowledge of the menu quickly cued my husband to ask her for wine pairings for each course. ÊWithout fail, she did not miss a beat and was two steps ahead. ÊListen closely, as she may speak quickly, however her quick speech matches her service and attention to detail. ÊSome may find her too fast, however my neurons are still firing.

As a guy, I am not that picky about food. ÊIf I was single, Gordos would be the staple diet whenever I eat out; a Êmeal at House could get me like at least 15 burritos. ÊHowever, if it wasn't for my female sidekick/companion, I would not have ever heard of House. ÊTHE HOUSE IS THE BEST RESTAURANT I'VE EVER EATEN AT. ÊNo joke. ÊYesterday was a most glorious night. I made a reservation for 9 pm. ÊWe came at 8 after the Embarcadero Building Lighting to see if we could get in early but it was so packed. ÊThe House is not big first of all, so it is crammed. ÊWithout even asking if we could be seated early, we went to King of Thai Premium. ÊI have never seen a King of Thai like this before. ÊIt is swanky to the extreme. ÊTheir menus are the same, but are embossed instead of laminated...crazy. ÊWe had some brewskis to pass the time and watch the regulars flirt with the Thai waitresses. ÊI am probably going to be like that one day, in say, 30 more years. ÊChrist. Came in at 9 and was seated promptly. ÊBecause the House is so small, you are seated very closely to the next table. ÊTherefore, its kind of hard to have an intimate conversation...a lovemaking melding of the words per se. ÊYou can't ask if this meal with lead to a night of boning due to arched eyebrows and grins. ÊAs appetizers, I ordered the salmon roll. ÊIt was really good. ÊIt is basically salmon in sushi with eggroll paper fried on the outside. ÊIt came with this wasabi sauce which I was not a fan of tho as I do not like wasabi. ÊIt should have come with some soy sauce. My girlfriend ordered the famed bass while I ordered the butterfish. ÊMy girlfriend's sea bass was really good; it was very tender and cooked to a flaky perfection. Ê There was a very light flavor. ÊHowever, while it may be the consensus best dish, I thought it paled in comparison to my butterfish. ÊIt was so buttery it was redick. ÊMy only complaint was that it was really small. ÊI wolfed it down in literally 5 minutes than watched with doe eyed jealousy as my girlfriend savored her cod. ÊMy butterfish, which was the special, came with 4 pieces of tuna sashimi. ÊEating that, I now noe the difference between good sashimi and bad sashami. ÊIt literally melted in my mouth. ÊGoddammit...yearn for it so much. For dessert, we had the chocolate truffle cake. ÊIt was very rich and good. Ê5 stars for the House. ÊIt is the best restaurant I have eaten at to this day. ÊAnother star goes out to our serveur who kept flubbing up on the 7 special entrees/specials. ÊI kept on making her repeat for kicks and interrupting during it to throw her off. ÊI only did it in jest...humblest apologies.

My bf kept raving about this place so I wanted to check it out. Surprisingly, I've been here before, but don't recall what I ate. I think I remembered it being as okay. However, this time, I remember. We got the pork belly appetizer, which was below average. The pork belly was a bit dry and overcooked. The sauce that came in it was a medley of stuff - tomatoes, celery, eggs, pickles...and prob more. I wasn't a fan. The meal was unpleasantly heavy, while I was hoping for a pleasant, melt-in-your mouth fattiness. Ê I ordered the special for the night - black cod. It was delicious. I liked how it was presented with two California rolls laid across the black cod. The rolls were average. The black cod was great! It was flaky, buttery and melted in my mouth. The entire piece was perfectly cooked. I finished it all. I do wish that there wasn't so much soy sauce on the dish. Service was good. We were seated right away on a Friday night without a reservation. Talk about lucky!

This is one of my favorite places to eat at in the city. Unfortunately parking in this neighborhood is a pain in the butt and the restaurant is incredibly small. Its usually hard to get a reservation when we wanna dine here. The hubby & I probably dine here at least a few times a year. The ribeye here is fantastic! The sea bass is another favorite! Lunch menu is a little different from dinner but just as good. For lunch i usually get the iron steak or the garlic noodles. The pickled cucumber they give you in the beginning of the meal is super yummy also but too bad they charge you a $1 for each additional plate after the 1st. Usually they have specials and believe me you always wanna order the special if theres something you like because they are out of this world =D I've tried almost every dessert they have on the menu and some of the special desserts they have occasionally but my favorite has to the housemade almond cookies. so simply yet so delicious! I would recommend anyone to eat here who hasnt because it is truly a gem! a foodies delight! Last time eating here on feb 2011 for a table of 9 the total came out to be $82 a person with tip included.

I really used to love this place when they had both locations, but after reading some of the other reviews on yelp about service and others having bad bottles of wine I had to write a not so great review. ÊWe had a bad bottle of wine and they were not very accomodating at first, but eventually after i was insulted about my taste in wine they offered to choose another bottle. Ê By the way it was the Chateauneuf de Pape Domaine Monpertuis "Cuvee Classique" 01, not as good as the Cuvee Tradition, but none the less a great wine especially around this 5-10 year mark. ÊIt was very explosive and bright in the front, which it should be, but less than thin, no body, as if it had been improperly stored or exposed to too much oxygen, and lacking any flavor in the finish. ÊI am sure Paul Jeune himself would have thrown this out. The food has always been great here, shrimp mango salad, chilean sea bass, coconut creme brule with lilikoi syrup, and mango tapioca pudding, mmmmm!

oh how we loved our meal at the house...so good we thought about it for days and days afterward. ÊI had done a ton of research on SF restaurants prior to our trip and I really wanted to get some really good food without spending hundreds of dollars. ÊThe SF dining options are insanely overwhelming but this was a real winner and very reasonably priced!! ÊWe started with the deep fried salmon. ÊFor some reason I think i was expecting more of a sushi type roll but what they brought out were two huge filets of salmon that had been flash fried (i'm guessing. ÊAbsolutely delicious! For my entree i got the seabass dish and it was as amazing as everyone says. ÊI've never had seabass just melt in my mouth like that and i'll probably never have it cooked as perfectly again. ÊAnd i loved the fat noodles and grean beans. ÊPerfect combination of flavors and textures. Ê Justin G got a beef dish with wasabi noodles and i think it was his fav meal of our entire 10 day vacation. ÊOnly comment i can make is that the portions were huge! not a complaint at all but you can't really bring leftovers to a hotel. ÊWe probably could have done without the appetizer and not been as stuffed but it was all perfect. ÊAll of this along with two glasses of wine & tip for just about 100 bucks. ÊWe could not have left this place any happier...

In the heart of North Beach and seemingly out of place surrounded completely by quaint trattorias, bars and espresso cafes, this uber-popular asian fusion bistro is clearly the place to be for the hip and beautiful asian set on a Friday night. A number of unique and delicate selections are offered on the regular menu, and the waitress rattles off another six or eight specials in an impressive recitation. ÊThis place is all about presentation; everything came out looking quite lovely. ÊWe opted for two small plates and a refreshing lychee iced tea, followed by a shared entree. We started with a lightly battered deep fried salmon roll with the skin on, served with a nice chinese mustard glaze. ÊThen came ahi tuna poke served on crispy nori chips. ÊFinally, and this was surely the showcase dish for us, baked black cod drizzled with a delicious ginger soy demi-glaze, and crowned by a warm whole California Roll (real snow crab) sliced on the bias and covered with a dollop of green tobikko. ÊNow *this* was a nice dish. The service was good; they accommodated us even though we were 20 minutes late. ÊTwo flaws on this one: its deafeningly loud, which is exacerbated by how closely bunched the tables are placed, and its very stuffy and hot. ÊOtherwise, a unique and pleasant change from the typical North Beach back block dining venture.

Some of the best food I've had. Absolutely amazing! Service is good, fast and to the point. Street Parking is horrible, so park at a garage and simplify your life. If you're going for dinner, make reservations. I saw a lot of people try to get seated but they simply had no room (this place is very small). Just an awesome place!

With the House, you can always expect a great meal. I've been going here for the past few years and everything i've had has always been quite delicious. I'm a big fan of the black cod, sea bass, and the scallops. It's a pretty small place, so make sure you make reservations, or come early.

Reliably one of the best places in town. This is one of the places I almost take friends and family to. Pros: Awesome, creative, well-presented food. I've had the pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce twice, as well as multiple fish specials, always well done. If you get an appetizer, make it the fried salmon rolls (they come with a spicy Chinese mustard dipping sauce on the side... divine!) The Scharffen Berger cake for dessert, don't miss this if you're a chocolate lover. A reasonably well priced meal for the quality of food you get. Cons: Even with a reservation I've had to wait up to 30 minutes. But it's still been worth it every time. It's a small restaurant and really lively (read loud) which I personally like, but may be a turn off for others.

Ever go to a restaurant the first time, LOVED the food, but when you go back the 2nd and 3rd time, it wasn't as good as you remember it to be?? ÊYou won't have that problem here. ÊThis has to be my favorite restaurant in SF. ÊI've been a loyal patron to this place for 10 years. ÊBack then, I used to frequent their 9th Ave location, which was much bigger than this location. ÊOne word describes this place - CONSISTENCY in the quality of their creations. If you're a fish lover, you MUST try their chilean sea bass. ÊThat's been a favorite of many time and time again. ÊIt's cooked to perfection in every way...not overcooked nor is it ever undercooked. ÊIf you want to venture off to different fishes, make sure you ask for the special of the day. ÊI don't think I've ever been disappointed with any of their specials yet. ÊTheir steak is amazing as well. ÊIt's not steakhouse quality, but the flavors dance around your taste buds. Ê Another all time favorite of mine is their perssimmon pudding. ÊThey only have it during October or November, when they're in season. ÊI can't wait to go back this year for it! I docked one star because on occassion, we'll get a waitress that's less than friendly and we can barely understand her English.

Is there a doctor in The House? Why I think there is, each dish is certainly doctored up with creative little garnishes and are made to look quite pretty. ÊUnfortunately, as oft is the case, looks can be deceiving, and my last few visits to The House left me feeling let down that the beauty was not matched by the flavors. A fried tumbleweed toupee did nothing to rescue the asparagus drowning in dressing, the colorful flair atop a crab cake gussied it up but could not distract from its over minced texture and lack of fresh crab taste and qualities. Wasabi noodles were one dimensional and just burned (there is something really amiss if I don't want to take home leftover noodles) and the greens in a salad had brown edges. Each item with dressing had too much mixed in. Overall I was simply left uninspired and the reflected fondness for The House from times past has waned.

"And I... Will Always Love You... Will Always Love you!!!" -Whitney This is by far, one of my favorite restaurants in the city. ÊIt never fails! ÊWhen I have visitors from out of town, this is usually the first place I call. Ê For appetizer, I'd recommend the scallop special. ÊAlways cooked to perfection. ÊNo scallops? ÊThen go for the salmon rolls. ÊBeware, the mustard is very spicy, but serves as the perfect compliment to the dish. Ê On to the entrees.... If they have the cod special, it's always a must. ÊI love the way the sauce hits the pallet as you try to decide if you're going to eat the California roll or the cod which melts in your mouth. ÊIt's always a hard choice. ÊOtherwise, my default would be the sea bass. ÊSo much tasty food, so little room in my tummy! Bon appetit!

After reading all these good review about the place, decide to give it a try. Ê Appetizer - one of the special of the night was a Seared Day Boat Scallop with ponzu sauce. ÊThe scallop was seared to perfection - the middle is still hot and not overcooked at all. Love the greens on top, the peppery green balanced really well with the meaty sweet scallops. And this is really the Only highlight of the meal. ÊThen time for entrŽe and everything just went downhill... Main Courses - Warm Wasabi Noodles with Flatiron steak. We had great expectation on this one from all the reviews. However, it was a disappointment. ÊThe noodles were way too oily while the beef is good itself - grilled and seasoned well; but they failed to complement each other. ÊI was thinking a beef stir fried noodle will taste better than this. Another main course we had was also a special of the night - Halibut and mussels cooked in a curry broth/sauce. Again, the halibut was good, but the curry sauce was too bland; and I wish that it can serve with some rice or bread so I can soak up the sauce. Overall, it is a nice little place, attentive service and generous portion. Maybe I should have tried the sea bass... but you know.... Oh well!

I really REALLY wanted to like this place after hearing rave reviews. Im a HUGE fan of asian fusion food. ÊUnfortunately, I'd say it was good but overhyped. Food was not bad, but what I really noticed was that the environment felt stressful and cramped. ÊSo much so that I literally got shanked at this restaurant. ÊNo joke! ÊOur server was nice but was so stressed and hurried that she carried way too much to our table at once, and as a result, accidentally stabbed my shoulder with the steak knife while trying to bring us our entrees and utensils!! First time for everything I guess! I did enjoy my meal (& would give it a 4 star review if it didn't have such bad energy), but I will probably not be coming back here again anytime soon.

I was so excited to FINALLY check out this place after wanting to eat here for so long! ÊBf told me to pick the restaurant he'd be treating me to to congratulate me on my new job, and he must really love me because he let me pick The House despite the horrible location! ÊThe only time we were able to get a reservation Saturday morning for later that night was at 9. ÊIt was late, I was hungry, but it worked out after all. ÊWas it worth the wait & hassle for parking? ÊNO! ÊThere's so many good reviews for this place & so many of my Yelp buddies have praised them, but bf & I just thought it was "okay" & not worth the trip out. ÊAnd mind you I am no way a fusion hater..I love it when it's executed right! We ordered: *Shrimp & Chinese Chive Dumplings ($9): ÊThey were okay nothing really popped out & I definitely prefer authentic Chinese ones over these. ÊKimchi was served on the plate too. *Warm Wasabi House Noodles with Flat Iron Steak ($18): Nicely made noodles with a hot but not way too overwhelming wasabi flavor. ÊNicely grilled flat iron steak cooked perfectly medium rare (per requested) and topped with cucumbers and more of their rendition of kimchi....so much kimchi!! ÊAgain just okay, not very impressive. Ê(My dish) *Chicken Breast with Roasted Portabella White Truffle Oil Sauce (under $20?): ÊI love truffles/truffle oil! ÊI semi-secretly wished to switch with him as this was his dish. ÊThe chicken was cooked nicely as it was moist. ÊThe truffle oil sauce was yummy and the mashed potatoes had a smooth consistency. Ê *(special of the day) Red Velvet Cake ($8): ÊNot very sweet which could be a good thing but it just fell flat. ÊI prefer by a longshot That Takes The Cake's red velvet cupcakes over the cake here. Service was pretty attentive and prices are affordable for a fancyish fusion menu. ÊAs others mentioned this place is tiny and you are seated so close to the next table. ÊI've always found that almost every time I am in a tiny restaurant like The House, I end up sitting next to a really annoying lady!! It wasn't bad but it wasn't great. ÊIt is what Yelp says, "A-Ok."

Food Rating: 5/5 Price/Value: 2/5 (meaning just enough portions, and priced a little more then I wanted, but not super expensive) Do not come here if you don't have reservations! :P I was in san francisco one night and I felt like being adventurous and trying something new. Luckily, I had the yelp app on my iphone, typed in asian fusion nearby and this place popped up. It had over 400 reviews at the time with 4-5 stars! OMG! I thought I had to try this place. Parking is hard to find since this is in north beach, but I feel you can always find parking when if you try really hard enough. After 10 mins, we found parking. We walked in asked how long is the wait...they said 20 mins. I said OK, hostess took down our name and added a party of 2 to the list. We thought we can just walk around north beach for a little bit and come back when it was 20 mins. This also gave me a chance to read some reviews off my iphone and figure out what were the best plates too eat. Everyone kept raving about Êthe seabass. I thought, I love seabass...ooh can't wait to try. We came back in 20 mins and stood there. There were no seats to sit, it was such a small cramped place but it had a nice modern decor. I kept my eye on the clock, we waited 10 more mins, then 10 more, then hostess said it'll be another 10. I started to lose track of time, but I remember getting seated 1 hour after we put the name on the list. Folks who even had reservations had to wait 10 or 20 mins. I thought I've waited this long, it must be really good! We finally sat down, I ordered the seabass and my bf ordered the steak. We both wanted the seabass, but we usually order two different plates, just in case one wasn't good, then the other should be good. Then we split half of our plate and give it to the other. I was totally hungry. When it came, the food looked great. "A" for presentation. The seabass was great and the steak my bf had was great. I thought the seabass would be great since everyone raved about it, but wasn't sure if the steak would be, but it turned out very tasty. I'd come back here again, but next time, I will make reservations!

The food is great. I love the appetizers and their dessert was to die for! I'm writing a late review so I can't exactly recall what I ordered. However the appetizer with salmon was really good...I believe it was served like a eggroll. The creme brulee was FAB, it had a sweet taste from the grape fruit. The only thing that bothered me was their service. We made reservations under our name and they had to ask how many people there were. They should have been able to know by just checking the records. Instead all of us stood there trying to recount the amount of people that were coming sicne we had a large party. There were little things here and there about the service that I can't quite remmber that bothered us at the table. Either way I think the food is too good to just stop coming.

J. introduced this place to us last year on our annual MLK visit and all nine of us loved it so much; in fact, we were all so thoroughly impressed, we decided to come back for dinner the following day! ÊSince lunch is definitely a better deal, especially for one of their signature dishes - the sea bass with house noodles and green beans at $20, we stopped in on Saturday afternoon. ÊThe four of us were pretty excited to return after a year-long absence, and M. Êalready knew she would be ordering the sea bass the night before, which certainly didn't fail to impress yet again. Ê I ordered the skate special with a mushroom sauce on top of a layer of Chinese broccoli and mashed potatoes, which at $20 was a great price for such a wonderfully executed dish, I couldn't have been happier with my order. ÊUnfortunately, I was so excited to try the skate that when my dish came out, I delved right in and forgot that we were taking pictures! Again. ÊThere are just so many different things to try out here, but one thing is for certain, The House does a fantastic job with seafood. ÊI still dream about their seared yellow tail with crab sushi, which unfortunately is only offered on their dinner menu. ÊI had a sample of the curry noodles and it was tasty, but I'm glad J. and I didn't order another noodle dish for us to share since my fat-ass was so craving their noodles. Ê The entree portion here is very filling with your side of protein, starch, and veggies, but along with our appetizers of Calamari and Salmon Rolls, and our dessert orders of coconut-passion fruit crme brulee and Japanese pumpkin pecan pie - I was pretty much done for the rest of the day. ÊAs M. put it, "I want the flavors to last on my tongue for awhile," so hopefully, we won't have to wait a year to have it again!

This place, what I should say about? ÊIt's a really mixed feeling. ÊThe food itself was fantastic but the dining experience wasn't nice completely. I should've said "No" when the hostess offered the seats right by the room divider at the entrance area. ÊBut this place looked very busy and small. ÊSo I really didn't want to ask for more. ÊThen it became a big mistake and a big mistake made by me. ÊFor the whole hour, when people standing at the entrance area got bored, they were checking on my food, commenting on it, leaning as close as much towards our table and chair, talking over my head, texting with their elbows moving in front of my eyes. ÊAnd I had to sit straight, watched my table manner, refrained from talking and finished my food as soon as possible. ÊIf the owners were a little bit more thoughtful, they would've put a bigger room divider or a plant, or a door panel, or just something to keep customers at that table visually (though not physically) further away from the standing crowd. Ê Ê However, this place seemed to have good reviews on their food. ÊThe sea bass we ordered proved it! ÊIt was the most tasty sea bass dish I've ever had. ÊBf's mushroom rice with garlic prawn was delicious too (sort of risotto type). ÊThey've a lot of meat eater favorites and portion was big enough for 2 meals for me. ÊThe inside was simple and nice ,although it's also cramp and noisy. Ê If we go back for its food, we must not sit at that table again and hopefully our experience will improve.

Rating 3.5 stars I have to agree with a few of the reviews, but I was slightly disappointed. ÊDon't get me wrong! This place is good, but a 4.5 star on Yelp, got me all excited! Ê Some of the dishes are pretty solid. ÊThe pork in pomegranate sauce was quite tasty. ÊNot sure why some reviews said it was dry, b/c it was far from that. ÊThe sea bass was grilled to perfection in terms of how it was cooked. ÊAs for taste, it was good. ÊThe sauce came on the side, which was good, otherwise it would have been too salty. ÊHubby and mom say the steak was ok. ÊWe also tried the BBQ oysters, crabcake and dumplings for apps. Skip all except maybe the crabcake. ÊThat was ok. ÊDessert - nothing spectacular.

Just a word for the wise, this place opens for dinner at 5:30. Don't show up earlier or you'll be greeted with a boot back out the other way. But I was in a rush to catch a flight out from SFO that night, so I figured I'd try to pull an early bird. When ever I'm in the bay I try to make it here. This time, I had the usual, the pomogranate Porkchop. My friend the wasabi noodle and steak. And to start it off, the Eel rice where instead of being like sushi before, is more like a cream risotto now. In my opinion, it's a bit too rich now, with eel and cream sauce. But still same great place. No complaints as ever. And made my flight out with plenty of time.

ÊComing to San Francisco for a limited time, we wanted something very SF, and this had it. We started with some excellent white shrimp and chive dumplings and a special of monkfish liver in broth.

4 Stars for service & ambiance. I went with one other person. We had to make reservations either at 5pm or 9pm. I chose 5pm. It was good in a way because that's when it was really chill and quiet at the beginning. We were literally the first people to set food in the restaurant, but we weren't the only ones waiting for it to open. This place is super small and cute, but I highly recommend an rsvp if you want to eat here. It gets really packed and it becomes a chore to move in and out of your seat. 5 Stars for the food. One of my favorite dishes is the sea bass.. Soo good. I have been a sea bass fan for a long time and this one just melts in your mouth. I had asked to swap for the wasabe noodles instead of the garlic noodles. I would definitely come back here, but it will take planning for sure.

If I could give a half-star, House would certainly be a 4.5 star venue. Not to say that everything wasn't excellent, but there were some small details that keep it from getting that last star. Tonight, a group of five of us rolled in for our 7pm reservation on time - but as is typical these days, the table wasn't ready. Take note restauranteurs: make sure you're budgeting enough time for table turnover, especially in small restaurants. But I digress... we waited about 20 minutes, dodging obnoxious panhandlers who just didn't get the hint, before getting the table. The food and wine was very good, possibly even fantastic but not outstanding. The very amiable waiter ran down the specials Êand brought us our bottle of 2003 Elk Cove Pinot Noir (only mentioned by name because it is a great Pinot for the price, and so I'll remember it in the morning). I started with a classic Hot and Sour soup with Manila clams. This was a perfect hit, as I love good Hot and Sour soup and I love Manila clams - and the combination of both was unique and exceptional: spicy with a delicate seafood note. The "Wagyu Skirt Steak with Mashed Potatoes" wasn't that at all, but it was still a fantastic main course. Instead, it was actually a Wagyu Flank Steak, cooked perfectly to my specification of rare, with a beef and truffle reduction and served with a small bowl of white rice, which was a much better starch for this dish than the aforementioned mashed potatos. A quarter point was taken off for the white asparagus, which was a little underdone, but it was still one of the best steak dishes I have had in a long time. Dessert was a plum crisp with vanilla ice cream - a dish that is reminiscent of a Bavarian dessert whose name I can no longer recall - simple and very, very tasty. Take another quarter-point off for a lack of an espresso maker - de rigeur in San Francisco and especially in North Beach. House won't give food lovers a life changing meal, but it is great food - better than ever expected in North Beach.

Number 1000. 4.5 stars after this many reviews, from selective Yelpers no doubt. That pretty much says that this place kicks ass, and if you have not been here, you should probably try it. My revision. I heard from some of the staff that lately they have been getting the same orders for every table. It is almost always the Sea Bass, and other things touted by Yelpers. This place is really solid, so you can order other stuff, and I guarantee you will be happy. Chef Larry Tse is a master with fish. That said, his meats are really high quality. So I don't think you will go wrong if you venture away from Sea Bass and salmon rolls.

This place is great for lunch or for dinner. ÊNeither I Ênor anyone I've eaten with here has ever disliked anything we've ordered. ÊThe prices are pretty decent for the quality of the food and service. The soy glazed salmon that is a regular on the lunch menu is really, really tasty. ÊThey can, occasionally, go a little heavy on the sauces (in the noodle dishes, for example), but since the sauces are so good, that probably won't bother you too much. I love the Chrysanthemum tea.

I normally don't dig asian fusion food but this place does not disappoint. I've come here several times and it's been consistently good. ÊThe fish and steak entrees were both excellent. Two thumbs up!

I went here for the first time last night; it was about 9:30 and was still packed. ÊWe had reservations but still waited about 5-10 minutes for our table. The food is 2 things: 1) Beautiful. ÊSitting at our table waiting for our food, we were tempted to look around at other plates. ÊThey were all beautifully presented and garnished. 2) Delicious. ÊI had the sirloin steak and it's easily the top 3 I've had (the other two are Bob's Steakhouse at the Omni and ACME). ÊMy girlfriend had the porkchop, which I loved too... Plate envy. Ê Word of caution: the food is especially flavorful, likely from the Asian influence. ÊIf you're used to the more subtle flavor of say, French cuisine, you might find it a bit much. The bill came out to a bit over $50 for the two of us. ÊIt's worth the price; you definitely can't make food like this at home.

If your waitress mentions the black cod special, do yourself a favor and order this shit. It's amazing. This past weekend, I took some friends here, totally building the place up. I got a bit nervous because, well, what if The House didn't live up to their expectations? But this dinner pretty much blew them away. And me, again. I was able to sample more dishes, and all were outstanding: the scallops appetizer, the mussels, the sea bass and noodles, the steak and noodles, the short ribs special, and the salmon. Again, the bean tempura, deep-fried salmon roll (and its sauce), and the tuna tartare were what I remember them to be. Presentation of food here is very thoughtful. The space is small, and weekend nights are busy and can be loud, although from my experience the table at the front near the window isn't too bad -- perhaps the loudness intensifies further inside the restaurant. Decor is minimal, but who the eff cares. The food is the star here, nothing else.

This was a very popular place to eat at when they first opened way back when. ÊI am happy to report that nothing has changed much. ÊEverything we had here recently is still pure perfection. Must try appetizers: Classic fried calamari Tempura green beans Deep-fried salmon roll Entrees ~ I always stick to two main ones, Wasabi noodles with flatiron steak or grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. ÊBoth dishes are always cooked perfectly. Desserts ~ apple pie a la mode - best apple pie I've ever had and the mango tapioca was delectable! A definite must try if one has never been here. ÊMake reservations as this place is pretty small and gets very crowded.

I came here because my 9-month-pregnant sister-in-law was craving their grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy which in fact not only satisfied her but gave her contractions :P She did not go into labor by the way! I had the grilled mahi mahi with california rolls which wasn't bad but the best dishes were our appetizers- seared sea scallops & kobe beef tartare & my brother ordered the angus rib eye with homeade teriyaki & toasted garlic butter. The meat was very tender and tasty! Service was great, especially since we had a 3-year-old with us. ÊWe went on a Sunday night at 5pm so we didn't have to wait for a table but the place was packed by the time we left.

This place is well reviewed and deserves it! I was sad they ran out of the Miso Black Cod :-( We did get the last order of BBQ Oysters which was my favorite appetizer of the night, Kurobuta pork with Pomegranates was my favorite main dish, Mango tapioca was a pretty dessert. I wouldn't recommend the passionfruit creme brule, I'm not the biggest fan of it to begin with but Raymond who is a fan was also turned off by the sourness of the passionfruit. Ê Parking was a pain

OMG the ginger soy marinated Chilean sea bass is quite possibly the best seafood dish on the planet! Marinated and cooked to perfection -- served with thick noodles and green beans. The grilled calamari and steamed mussels appetizers here are also great. This place is a must if you visit/live in SF!

I went with the intention of wanting to like this place, on a Tuesday night with high hopes. Given that we had reservations and told them it was an anniversary dinner, you'd think they'd seat us somewhere decent, not right AT the door. ÊWe could have practically served as the hostess check-in. ÊNot to mention the tables are literally an inch apart. ÊI felt bad as I sat on our neighbors food as I slid into my seat. The restaurant was understaffed. ÊI overheard complaints from others about not have received dishes, and the two waitresses were unfriendly, wore scowls, and were anxiously dashing around the room. ÊAfter 15 mins, someone finally came to take our order but the waitress' anxious energy made for a very stressful dinner. We ordered the Seabass and the Steak which were flavorful like the other Yelpers have commented. Ê However, an hour after getting home, severe food poisoning kicked in. ÊI guess my experience at the House, just wasn't meant to be. ÊUnfortunately, I don't think I'll ever go back.

Love The House! I've been lucky every time I come here because they always have my favorite specials. Miso black cod with california rolls - cooked to perfection every time. Seared scallop appetizer - I love scallops, so I love this dish. Pomegranate porkchop - on their regular menu, but equally delicious if your special favorites are not being served that night. Kobe beef skirt steak w/ mashed potatoes - I substitute out the mashed potatoes with the house noodles which are very good. The kobe beef has a good marble of fat, but make sure you eat it fresh, because that marble looks extremely unappetizing when you open up the to-go box the next day. The dessert menu never looks super appealing to me so I've never ordered it here. I would definitely make a reservation, because the space is extremely limited. If you want, you can also call around 5:15 or 5:30 when they open for dinner to ask what their specials are before you head over. On weekdays you can normally find metered parking, but if not there's a decent parking garage between Stockton and Vallejo that is within walking distance.

My oh my.This has definitely become one of my new favorite restaurants in San Francisco. I took my girlfriend here for a dinner date on a Saturday.Place was PACKED.Luckily I had made reservations the night before for 9:00PM for two.Arrived ten minutes early,seated in 20 minutes.Yes.I will tell you now to reserve early,we seen another couple when we walked in,we sat,ate,paid,then left and they were still waiting so plan accordingly.The place is real small and real cramped with barely enough space to even stretch your arms.Lighting is nice and dim,romantic much but it gets real loud in there,nothing to be surprised about.The waiter service here is excellent.Waiters were very nice and attentive and would answer any question you throw at them professionally.We know because the table next to us asked tons of questions and the waiter answered each one with confidence,so I know the staff here know their menu very well and are prepared for any question you would ask. The food: We ordered fried calamari as our appetizer.It was delicious.There was nothing I did not like about this dish.Light,good portion,crisp.As our main dishes,my girlfriend ordered the Sesame soy glazed salmon in a bonito sake broth.Wow,this dish was delicious.Comes with asparagus and a side of rice that both fit perfectly.Broth was amazing.Whenever we go out to eat,she barely ever finishes her food.Her plate was clean.Salmon was cooked to perfection,nice and moist with lots of flavor.Very fresh.I ordered the Angus Ribeye,medium rare!Delicious.The steak was cooked perfectly.Not too bloody,not too cooked,very tender,and very juicy.Comes with asparagus as well as mashed potatoes.The mashed potatoes include sweet potato mixed in!Which was a pleasant surprise!It was so good.My dish was obviously cleaned out as well.We decided to order dessert there as well so we shared a bittersweet cake with I believe is coffee ice cream on top.The chocolate cake was so moist,not overly sweetened and the coffee ice cream just complimented it so well.At the end of the night,we were very much satisfied with our meal.It was not too much,but at the same time it was not too little,it was perfect.By the way,everything that we ordered was plated very nice and very classy. Overall,I would rate this place a 4.5,subtracted just due to the cramped seating. Pros: -Food is AMAZING -Wait staff is professional -Food came out quick -Perfect amount served Cons: The only con is the cramped space,but it didn't bother us very much as we came here to eat. Everyone should try this place!Remember book early and if not plan accordingly.

Dear House, How do I love thee? Let me count the ways! First, your sea bass is to die for. Second, your cod is to die for. Third, your chicken curry noodles are to die for. Fourth, your salmon skin roll appetizer is to die for. Lastly, all your desserts are mmm mmmm good, especially the black and white cheesecake! Yum-o! Plus, the wait staff is great, especially Lieng (if he still works there). The price is just right. I agree that it can be a bit cramped but who cares?

This great little place is located in North beach just off Columbus. I must say that parking is not so great in this neighborhood and you get barked at alot by the men in front of the stripe clubs. . . but don't let this deter you the food here is excellent. Do make a reservation because the place is not very big. EVERYTHING that we ordered was DELICIOUS. We ordered 2 aps. and a salad to share. The blue lake (green) beans that came with the most delicious sauce, ginger soy, with cilantro and a bunch of other yummy stuff. The crab cakes was also incredible and came with a little bit of caviar. This tells me that the cooks or whoever created the dishes pays attention to the details. The salad was totally big enough for each of us to have a little.(party of 4) My meal was so tasty i wish i hadn't eat the appetizer. I had the sea bass which i noticed that alot of people where eating. I did get to try everyone else's dishes and they were also amazing. The rib eye was great and so was the Chicken. Although the prices here are on the high side is have to say that the portions did match the price, not like those swanky places that give you bite sized meals. I was full when i left. My only COMPLAINT is that, even though we did make a reservation our table was not ready on time, and the waitress forgot to bring my wine. No big deal though the food was fabulous and i would recommend this place to a friend.

I don't understand why this place is SO popular with over 1400 reviews just like I don't understand Slanted Door with over 2100 reviews! ÊYes, the food is Êmore tasty and more innovative than your order by number Chinese restaurant down the block. ÊYes, the presentation is nice and individualized unlike family-sized troughs elsewhere. ÊYes, the desserts are much better than orange slices secretly sweetened with sugar water. ÊSo compared to traditional Asian restaurants I can see the allure, but compared to all restaurants in San Francisco I don't see it being THAT outstanding for all this buzz. Pickles: Sure beats deli pickles! ÊLittle slices of pickled cucumbers with sesame seed ground on top. ÊHad that subtle vinegar taste that is common in Korean pickles. Deep Fried Salmon Roll with Chinese Hot Mustard: ÊTake raw sashimi grade salmon, wrap it in a spring roll then deep fry it! ÊHmm! ÊLoved how there were varying degrees of doneness with the center being raw. ÊThe crispy dough gave a good crunch texture. ÊThe mustard dipping sauce was like Chinese mustard + soy sauce + some other stuff, a nice departure from what comes in those little plastic packets. Caesar Salad with Crispy Scallops: Tiny seared scallops and romaine lettuce. ÊNo croutons, maybe the mini scallops were supposed to replace them? ÊAlso, not very generous with the cheese (...if there was any). ÊProbably the least satisfying dish here for me. Scallops: Much larger scallops than the ones in the Caesar salad. ÊPerfectly cooked with a seared exterior and flan like interior. ÊThe sauce it was floating in was perfect. Kurobuta Pork Chop with Pomegranate Currant Sauce: Tender pork chop with such a nice tangy sauce. ÊA few simple vegetables underneath, that would be quite boring if not for the sauce. ÊThere was some deep fried root chip (taro?) that was tasty too. Mahi Mahi with PEI Mussels: Sadly there were only three mussels, which is quite a change from those huge vats at Belgian places. ÊThe star, the mahi mahi, was plentiful and did a great job absorbing flavor from the broth base. ÊI'm normally not a huge fish fan because fillets can tend towards bland, but I sure scarfed this one up by the spoonful with the amazing broth! Garlic Noodles: We tried to get a side of wasabi house noodles since a friend of ours doesn't eat beef (for religious reasons, not for stupid self-important diet preference reasons) so the steak was out. ÊWe were politely, but firmly denied, but were offered this off-the-menu option. ÊHuge udon noodles stir fried with some garlic. ÊTasty, but not as out of control garlicky as a Filipino version. Japanese Pumpkin Pie with Macadamia Nuts: Macadamia nuts in the pumpkin pie, why hadn't I thought of this? ÊLoved the crunch in the creamy pie. ÊTwo awesome ingredients making one great dessert. Coconut Crme BržlŽe with Passionfruit Puree: Not overly coconutty. ÊPassionfruit is always appreciated in my book, though I think this came from concentrate rather than fresh out of the fruit. ÊA perfect way to Asianify a Western favorite.

Made a reservation, cause its tedious here without one. Tuna Tartare was delicious. Perfect starter. Pork chop, insanely good. Sauce was sweet and tangy. Flat iron steak with wasabi noodles was so yummy. the noodles were perfectly cooked and fresh. My steak was medium and just right. Creme brulee was as it should be texture wise with a tangy sauce, it worked well. Its loud and crowded but you wont mind when your eating. Get some wine the list is decent and large.

Recently moved to North Beach and was really excited to go to such a highly rated restaurant! Made reservations (you definitely have to, at least for a weekend evening) and went on a Friday night. The space is small and relatively intimate (though it can get loud since everyone's kind of seated close to each other) but the food was absolutely amazing and the service is spectacular. Ordered a bunch of stuff + would definitely recommend the ahi tuna and deep fried salmon roll. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, though. Enjoy!

Came here for my brother's birthday dinner. ÊWe ordered the steak tartare special appetizer and the bbq oyster special appetizer to start. ÊThe tartare may have been my favorite of the entire evening. ÊI would have wrestled even the birthday boy to eat more of it. Ê I got the mushroom rice w/ shrimp which was really tasty. ÊI tried some of my sister's steak w/ wasabi noodles. ÊThe steak was fine, and since I'm not a big wasabi fan, the noodles were just ok for me. ÊOf course, that's personal preference, so if you're cool with wasabi, you'll probably like these. My bro's pork chops were also pretty good, but the currant sauce overpowered the pork. ÊI also had a taste of the broth of a thai curry style seafood dish, which was really good. I know some people have had less than good experiences w/ the service, but I actually thought it was really good. ÊThe only thing is that the dinner was super short, just over an hour. ÊThey have to turn tables over quickly because it's small and there's always a line of people wanting to eat there, so I get it, but it would be nice to get the same good food with a little more time to catch up w/ your dining company I definitely intend on coming back to The House to try other dishes though

damn tasty asian fusion cuisine. Êi've worked in a couple restaurants with the same theme, but this one takes the cake flavor-wise.

Êeach dish was seasoned perfectly. i really, really wish i could remember the intricacies of each dish or more importantly what we had but there was a 45 minute wait and i had no qualms about venturing over to another bar for a couple drinks. Êneedless to say, i was already sauced up when dinner started b/c of the constant glares from our neighbors who were 3 inches away on each side. from what i remember, we ordered two bottles of sake, the tartare, the oysters, a scallop special, the rib eye family style, and what took the cake: the mushroom rice with prawns. Êthe rice was fluffy, earthy, comforting, savory, and fuming with the flavor of truffles. moreover it wasa Êlively atmosphere, great informative service ( insisted they not need to replate b/t courses since its a pain but they did anyway ), Êand oh i will return.

I almost don't want to Yelp about it because it would make last minute reservations next to impossible to get :) but really, this place is amazing. to start out with -- the food. their signature pomegranate pork chop with currant sauce was simply perfect ... and here, the sauces and the sides (asparagus & mashed potatoes) are truly main components of this epicurean affair. the black cod was a culinary work of art topped with a delish handroll and garnished with just the right amount of caviar. melt in your mouth heavenly goodness that reminds me of the exquisite tastes of asian dining with the fine attention to detail / texture from a western kitchen. the softshell crab tempura was definitely a game-changer for me -- never thought of taking a whole crab and making tempura out of it! the great part was that it was paired with house's famous semi-fried veggies on top of a bed of siracha mixed with hot/sweet noodles. and to top it all off, the service. everyone was very attentive, helpful, and engaging. truly a "woohoo! as good as it gets!" experience

Oh House... you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. You are my favorite fusion restaurant. Generally I scorn upon Asian fusion, given I actually know what Asian food tastes like, but this place tends to lean more toward it's American roots (and that's probably why I like it). For a group of 3: Scallop appetizer special Deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy Angus ribeye steak, housemade teriyaki, toasted garlic butter Niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce The main ingredient for each dish was FANTASTIC. Loved the steak, the pork, the bass, and the scallops. No doubt food quality there--everything made was delectable, juicy, and to-die-for. Presentation? Good. Portions? Great. You get a pretty decently valued meal for what you pay for. One criticism though, which is why I'm taking a star away, is that the other ingredients they use don't match the quality of the rest of the plate. My mashed potatoes were definitely not better than Popeye's and my green beans I could have probably made better myself. House, I want the whole shebang--an excellent quality dish AND sides! Maybe next time???

Finally! A restaurant that does justice on asian fusion cusine. I've been eyeing this place since 2 birthdays ago, and for some odd reason, things just never worked out. Fortunately, I was able to grab an impromptu dinner with a long-time friend couple of fridays ago. It was early 6ish, and it was already getting crowded, luckily we got a seat before the masses came! **This is not the biggest restaurant in the area, so if you want seats for a larger party, you need to make reservations!** Ê Once you walk pass the VERY SMALL waiting area, there are tables against the walls, a crowd of happy patrons, and artfully plated deliciousss foods. House has a great atmosphere whether you are having a casual dinner, or group dinner for a special occasion. SERVICE was fantastic. Even though they looked understaffed over worked, and slightly stressed at the time. ÊThey Êsomehow manage to keep calm, cool, and collected as they helped my party out. The waitresses knows the business inside and out, but more importantly they know how all the specials taste, which was a first for me. Refills were not hesitated. At the end of your meal, they rush you the check so they can kick your asses out for other paying customers; I felt rush, but we decided to order dessert and converse for another 30 minutes, sorry folks. FOOD!! Calamari to start, followed by Ahi Tuna, Grilled Hamachi (Specials), and some strawberry strudel pie... Ê The Calamari had a mustardy zing when you first bite into it; it's so delicious and a pretty creative twist to the usual deep fried, acne causing calamari. Entree's were delish, our dishes were cooked to perfection, the fish literally melted in our mouths. It was a bit spicy, but good to the very last bite! Dessert was alright... We should have went to some italian cafe to get gelato instead.. *5 STARS HOUSE*

There is a reason The House has 4.5 stars with more than 1000 reviews....their asian fusion style food rocks. Atmosphere is understated but clean. Great place for lunch if you're in North Beach and don't fancy Italian. I whole-heartedly recommend the 2 dishes I had...the deep-fried salmon rolls with chinese hot mustard sauce and chipotle bbq pork loin sandwich. The later comes with a tasty side salad and is one of the best sandwiches I had in quite some time. They also served a spicy cucumber salad as a pre-lunch treat. It's the small places like this that make SF a great foodie city.

This place is simple and small, but still pulls off fancy. I've been here twice with my boyfriend. Once for valentine's day, and another for my birthday. During lunch time, this place seems very casual, but at night, when the lights are dimmed, the place instantly looks that much fancier. We got the fried sushi roll-- I thought this was so delicious! It was a big chunk of salmon wrapped with seaweed & egg roll peel, with a nice cabbage garnish & a miso-wasabi like dipping sauce. My boyfriend got the Grilled Sea Bass-- he said he heard good things about it so he decided to give it a try. It came with udon stir fry noodles and sautŽed green beans (his favorite!). I got the Sesame Soy Glazed Salmon which came with rice, mustard greens, and pretty garnishes. Let me tell you, this is probably the best salmon (aside from sashimi :P ) I've ever had. It was full of flavors and the salmon itself melts (in a good way) in your mouth. I literally said "Woww!" when I took the first bite. The portions aren't as big as one would like, but it definitely is enough to get you comfortably full. Even though this is a "special occasion" type of restaurant, I'd really like to come here more. The pricing is kind of out of a college student's range, but this is an exception. By the way, my boyfriend and I both really liked the sea bass, and the vegetables that came with it were nice and crisp. If you plan on hosting a party here, just heads up- they only take two credit cards per table and the restaurant is relatively small, so plan wayyyy ahead! Make reservations, especially for dinner time.

Fusion cuisine is one of those things that can either go horribly wrong or really, incredibly right. Fortunately, this place serves up the latter. Cute, fresh, bright and welcoming simple decor, it's comfortable and possesses this wonderful quality of being a nice place without pretentiousness or stuffiness. Considering the quality of the food, the prices are pretty reasonable. And oh goodness, the food. How can I even begin to describe it? In this world where everything is fast, processed, and all about efficiency, it's so refreshing to go to a place that allows you to really enjoy every moment, every bite, and just leave things simple. This place does just that. The food is so fresh, and incredibly flavourful yet still light. The taste is absolutely wonderful, full of delicate flavours but you can still really taste the good food itself, not relying solely on lumping in as many spices as possible. I sound like I'm writing a love letter, but it was just *that* good. The people are really nice too, friendly and not in-your-face, and don't rush you. I am so glad some friends brought us here (this being their favourite restaurant in SF), and as we didn't know what to expect, it was even more of a treat. Great sandwiches, good drink selection, delicious calamari and seafood in general, and the udon curry noodles with grilled tender chicken, oh goodness I'm still thinking about it. I want to eat some now!

I saw this place getting incredibly high marks on Yelp and figured it was worth a shot. ÊShowed the website and photos to my wife, whose immediate response was "oh my god, that's the most pretentious thing I've ever seen." Ê She was right, of course - House is terribly pretentious in its menu and especially in its plating; crab cakes piled like little fried snowmen with giant slices of veggie sticking out the top like feathers in a pimp's hat, slices of flash-fried salmon arranged around a central pillar of rice, and so forth. ÊIt's all very modern and artsy, which is why I was surprised at how down to earth the clientele was - largely out of towners - "Sacramento" out-of-town, not "Macon, GA" out-of-town, although this may have been due to the time of day. Ê I had the angus steak and it was outstanding. ÊWife had the Ahi Tuna, which was also rather good. ÊWe split two appetizers; the scallops were sensational, and the other thing was kind of overshadowed, to the point where I have to stop and remember what it was. ÊSalmon, I think. ÊWonderful, wonderful food - I'm really glad we cancelled our reservation for the Carnelian Room and did this one instead. Ê Of all the restaurants we ate at in SF, this is easily the top of the list.

The food was great! ÊThe seabass especially. Super tender, moist & flaky. However, I went here for a first date with someone totally new. Mistake to come here with someone you are trying to get to know. It's loud when busy, the parking sucked, and the venue was pretty cramped. We got seated near the kitchen. ÊThat meant waiters rolling through...pretending to hear every word he said...constant chair moving....at least the food was delicious I would come back here on a less busy night.

I'm usually not a fan of Asian fusion, but the House did make me consider! I had lunch with my boss and 3 co-workers yesterday and since it was our Christmas lunch, we went to town! Ê Appetizers: -White shrimp and chinese chive dumplings -Deep-fried salmon roll with Chinese hot mustard -Baby arugula salad with crispy scallops Entrees: -Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy -Sesame soy glazed salmon -Warm wasabi house noodles with Angus flatiron steak -Niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce -Black cod (this wasn't on the menu, however, a special of the day) Dessert: -Persimmon pudding -Chocolate pecan tart The grilled sea bass was my dish. ÊThe sea bass was perfectly prepared. ÊThe garlic ginger soy sauce was served on the side and was just ok. ÊYou couldn't really taste the garlic nor ginger. ÊI didn't really miss the sauce cause the sea bass was perfectly seasoned. ÊAccompanying this dish were the house noodles, which is pan-fried udon, and green beans. ÊThe house noodles were good, however, I found myself missing just plain steamed rice. ÊThe sea bass had its own natural fish oil, the green beans were stir fried and the noodles were pan fried. ÊA little too much oil for me. Ê My boss and co-workers on the other hand cleaned their plates and couldn't stop raving about the food! ÊOverall, a great meal together!

How have I missed out on this place for 17 years??? After a morning of doing charity work, the boss took me here for lunch, and let's just say I would spend a week of envelope stuffing if it involved lunch here daily! The fried salmon rolls were delicious...i licked the plate The wasabi noodles with salmon, out of this world...and a very large portion. The leechi iced tea...let's just say i drank my body weight in free refills. Then, oh then the tapioca with mango for dessert...it was creamy, coconutty deliciousness...just order it. Found The House very reasonable, unassuming and the perfect lunch location....if you can nap after, because hello food coma! I'll be back soon to make up for the 17 years of missing out

I shuddered when I found out that I was supposed to meet friends at this place in north beach. Despite the fact that it has more positive reviews than days I have actually lived in San Francisco proper, I couldn't quite imagine a really good restaurant in the midst of the tourist hell that is columbus street. BUT it's really good! Excellent reviews are all deserved, and the wine list is great too. Even the desserts were exquisite, and I am often disappointed. Three cheers for The House. I might just have to brave the parking situation and come over here again...

Growing up eating Chinese food has made me somewhat of a snob when it comes to fusion. For some reason, I'm just not a fan, overpriced Chinese food with a fancy name. I always leave thinking, I could have had that meal for 1/3 the price! However, House was a pleasant surprise. I had heard so many good things from friends who had similar snobbery and I was still skeptical. We were lucky on our trip that they had such amazing specials that we couldn't turn down. The highlights of the night were definitely the kurobuta pork bun appetizer (MELTS in your mouth) and the miso seared black cod. just fyi. if these are the specials. No matter if you had your heart set on the sea bass, GET THEM. As much as I am an Asian Fusion snob, I will be back here.

It's always great to go back to a restaurant that has been around for over ten years in San Francisco. My first time at The House was in early 1996. Prior to this evening, my last time was about five or six years ago. The food is still very tasty and well prepared. In fact, not much about the actual restaurant has changed. From a menu perspective, the blue lake green bean tempura is still there. Main dishes are a 50/50 balance between fish and meat/poultry dishes. The grilled chicken breast with curry noodle is no longer on the menu; that was my favorite item. My friends and I shared the aforementioned green beans and the asparagus appetizer. I had the flat iron steak with wasabi noodles. We then shared the chocolate cake and the fruit tart special of the day for desert. ÊHonestly, I didn't taste much wasabi in the noodles, but the soy based sauce really hit the spot and worked well with the meat. It also comes with a topping of kimchee-style Asian slaw. ÊBoth desserts were excellent, but I was already too well lubricated from three glasses of wine to fully enjoy them. I look forward to eating here again, and I hope it will be sooner rather than later.

Wow. ÊYes it's that good. Came here with my family after hearing our neighbors raving about how scrumptious this place is. ÊWell, it is that good. Where to begin...oh yes. ÊWe started with an appetizer special that was served tonight: perfectly-seared scallops with microgreens and herbs on top, complemented with a delicious mustard sauce. ÊI've never had scallops that were so perfectly cooked: seared well on the outside, but so buttery inside... That was just the appetizer. ÊAfter having the great appetizer, our entrees came: "Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak" "Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy" "Grilled ahi tuna with spicy mustard aioli" A special that showcased halibut with some great curry (don't remember the exact name...) Well where to start! ÊThe steak was cooked perfectly and the wasabi noodles were definitely one of a kind. ÊThe sea bass literally melted upon eating, and the garlic ginger soy perfectly accented the delicacy of the fish. ÊThe tuna was delicious and the mustard aioli tasted almost like a wasabi sauce, so the taste perfectly accompanied the rare ahi tuna. ÊThe halibut was delicious, and the curry had a great earthy taste to it. Upon completion, we had to have a go with the dessert menu. ÊWe ordered the apple crumb pie a la mode, mango tapioca, and the creme brulee. ÊI'm not necessarily a very experienced dessert taster, but the tapioca and the creme brulee were pretty good. ÊThe apple crumb however...was pretty much the best apple pie I ever had. ÊIt managed to taste naturally sweet, with no noticeable additional sugar that plagues many other pies. ÊThen the crumb atop was so crisp and had a great texture. Ê Overall, it was a great family experience to eat at such a high quality restaurant such as "The House". ÊThis place definitely deserves a definite-must-return!

My heart, my heart! ÊCall a doctor, I think I'm having a heart attack! ÊWhen I saw the menu and and the skinny mixed crowd around, I thought I was definitely in for a late night run to JackNtheCrack for a second dinner, but I was dangerously surprised by the both the portion sizes and the speed that I got my great tasting food. Ê I have gone there twice already and the first time was a Bloody Valentine's Day Mess! ÊYuppie, loud Asian couples die! ÊThis is such a small restaurant and don't want to hear you're intimate details about your stupid wedding! Ê The menu is nothing too out of the ordinary and though you think you may have eaten food like this before for $5 at your local Hop Sing's, they throw in words like "Reduction" and "remoulade". Ê But my huge steak, which barely fit on the plate was terrific and my lovely date for the night had the sea bass, which I swear turned her on something right! ÊThe dessert's were ok, but by that time I was an hour into my food coma. Ê The service was O.K. and doesn't quite compliment the great tasting food. ÊTo piggyback off of the last review, the specials were so damn complicated I wasn't sure what the hell they were. Ê I would recommend this restaurant, but make reservations at the restaurant and with your local heart surgeon because you'll be needing it.

This is my favorite treat in the neighborhood. ÊI love the food here and the service is consistently amazing. ÊWe don't even order off the menu anymore, we just listen to what the specials are and pick from those. ÊThey always have the freshest fish and meats available. Ê The last time we went in we had the sashimi tuna toro and a grilled hamachi filet (all on one dish). ÊI love it when they give you more than one preparation on your plate. ÊIt makes it easier to decide. ÊThe pan roasted monk fish was a bit over done, but I've never had it cooked perfectly unless it's poached. ÊAnd it came in a coconut curry sauce with the most tender mussels I've ever had, so it's all good. Ê And every time they have a soup, do yourself a favor and order that! ÊThe best hot and sour soup I've ever had was here. ÊSimply amazing, I wish they had that as a special more often.

Four and a half stars, solid. ÊAfter eating dinner here, my dining partner remarked, 'Dinner was GORGEOUS' and... it was. It's a small, loud place and not the most comfortable joint in the city, but the food. ÊThe food. ÊTempura soft shell crab with spicy noodles: check. ÊChinese chive dumplings: check. ÊHalibut with coconut/mango sauce with fresh peas, cherry tomatoes, and fingerling potatoes: check. Ê Think this list needs some wine? ÊHow about a $40 bottle of Sancerre, and the meal was complete. ÊI'm going back, soon! ÊThey describe their cuisine as Asian-fusion and it is wonderfully flavorful along with not being super expensive.

Heard so much about this place over the years but i never got a chance to go until tonight. First off: Get a reservation! ÊThere were two dozen people standing in the front while we ate (it looked like an Apple Storefront). -Tuna Ahi Tartare with nori chip: Super delicious! ÊThe sour blend of the sauce matched the natural sweetness of the fresh fish. ÊThe nori chip was perfectly toasted and a good compliment to the tartare. ÊMy only complaint was that there wasn't enough to go around haha - Mussels with garlic infused shrimp sauce: I didn't try this, but the ppl dining with me said it was pretty good except it had a bit of an 'ocean' taste to it. -The Kurobuta Pork-chop: Kurobuta is a black boar that is known for it's tenderness and juiciness. ÊI feel like most places in the U.S. tend to over cook pork, and thus waste the Kurobuta. ÊI was told mine would be medium, but it was slightly more on the medium well side. ÊNot bad, but not great... -The Ribeye with teriyaki sauce: Very good! ÊThe steak was cooked just right and matched the mash potatoes very well! ÊThe homemade teriyaki sauce wasn't bad at all. -The Creme Brule: Made with Coconut and a Passion-fruit puree glaze on top...delish!!! -The Mango pudding: So simple, yet SO good. ÊHighly recommended. The House lives up to the hype. ÊNot only were the dishes high quality, but they came out quite fast and well presented. ÊThe service is great and the environment is packed but not uncomfortable!

Been here 3 times now, and every time was a 5-star experience. No, not a 5-star like Michael Mina or Masa's... this is more of a mom and pop's shop. Located in north beach, you could easily walk past this restaurant had it not been for the crowd of people standing in front of the place. The House is a casual and chic 5-star restaurant. You don't have to whisper and order a $200 bottle of wine, and you don't have 5 billion forks and knives... which are just a couple of things that I love about this place. We were seated right away at 8:30ish, but the other couple of times I needed a reservation because we went at prime time (6-8pm). We ordered the salmon roll, the oh-so-famous seabass, and the delicious wasabi noodles with flank steak. Let me tell you something, it was a PARTY IN MY MOUTH with every bite that I took. Man, they don't mess around! The sea bass melted in my mouth and I couldn't get enough of it! The wasabi noodle was a good compliment because it's not so sweet and the texture is completely different. The noodles were cooked to perfection with a wasabi sauce mixed in with some kind of teriyaki sauce giving it an asian fusion taste. Oh, and don't forget to get some Chamay beer! It's no wonder that this place is highly recommended by yelpers all around. ahh, so good... think I'll go back there tonight for another meal!

Very good dinner here last night, reasonably priced, and LARGE portions. 4 of us shared 2 appetizers to start- we had the ahi tuna tartare and scallops and both were very good... off to a great start (well, except i don't like wasabi (on tuna) but other folks LOVED it). we brought our own bottle of syrah and it complemented the asian fusion wine very well i had the mushroom risotto with grilled prawns and it was VERY tasty! i tried other folks food (Sea bass melted in your mouth, duck was pretty good, and flank steak was ok). all in all a pleasant surprise.. will Êbe back and will invite friends!

It's asian food not being too asian and far from traditional. Everything is mouthwatering and bang for the buck! -deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard. crispy outside and slightly cooked. superb! -warm wasabi house noodles with grilled salmon. noodles offer unique hint of spicy. uber yummy. -unagi avocado sandwich. with so many good items on the menu, I think this one is not a crowd favorite. -grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy and udon. winner of them all, it will melt right in your mouth. the sea bass is so buttery, perfectly cooked to tenderness. the udon is comparably delicious.

Finally after 3 long years of wanting to try this place, I finally found a nice guy to take me out on a date here. The entire experience couldn't of been any better. The food was heavenly, just like all of my fellow Yelp reviewers told me it would be. I ordered the Sea Bass w/ Soy Garlic dipping sauce, noodles, and green beans, and it was fabulous. My date ordered their special Halibut w/ mashed potatoes and veggies. It was also really good, and melted in our mouths. We also got the Scallop Caesar Salad, which was super garlicky and delicious. Of course we finished our meal with dessert- I got the Coconut Creme Brulee w/ Passionfruit sauce, and he got the chocolate cake w/ ice cream, which he couldn't stop talking about for the rest of the night. It was decadent, creamy and smooth. On top of the amazing food, the restaurant itself is small, cute, and friendly. At one point the power went out, but that didn't stop them from making our dishes amazing. They instead lit a lantern and gave all of us candles. So much more romantic...I would almost think that he planned it to happen. Haha. Even though The House doesn't need anymore cheerleaders, I will definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to try some place new. Soooo good!

Again and again this place just amazes me...!! So for the last 4-5 times I've eaten here in the last couple years, I've always ordered the same things--either the sea bass or the steak with wasabi noodles. ÊThis time around we ordered everything new! Appetizers included deep fried salmon roll, ahi tartare, and kobe beef tartare. ÊMain courses included the kobe beef served with chanterelle and mash special and the black cod in miso sauce special. And for dessert, a cup of coffee and ÊI believe it was a chocolate torte with coffee ice cream. The deep fried salmon roll was not as great as I expected it to be after reading all the reviews. ÊIt just tasted like a wonton eggroll wrapped around slightly cooked salmon and the chinese mustard sauce that accompanied had quite a bit of a kick to it which kind of killed it for us since we had no idea how strong it was and put too much on our first bite. The ahi tartare was exceptional, to me at least. ÊMy husband enjoyed the kobe beef tartare more but it was a bit too gourmet for my taste. ÊI couldn't put my finger on what it was suppose to taste like. ÊIt didn't taste like beef or any other meat for that matter but it was presented beautifully! My husbands kobe beef steak was SUPERB. Cooked perfectly at medium rare and so tender. ÊThe chanterelle and mash were also perfect sides with this lovely piece of meat. My black cod dish--beyond words--I've never had a better tasting fish. ÊI took the advice of another reviewer which said to order the cod if it ever was a special and I did and I can't thank them enough! ÊPLEASE ORDER THE COD! ÊIt was so luscious and really just melted in your mouth. ÊIt was 10 times better than my favorite (or was) seabass dish! The chocolate torte was okay. ÊIt was a bit heavy for my taste--think coffee ice cream on top of a thin sliced but very dense brownie. ÊI think it's because I ate it myself and it really was a dish to be shared but hubby was trying to be good so I was on my own. ÊHe claims his coffee was superb which I'll have to take his word for it since I'm not a coffee connoisseur. Service was excellent as usual. ÊOur reservation was was for 7:30 and we sat down at 7:32. ÊParking is, of course, HELL on Broadway but we always park at the Vallejo parking garage which is just 2-3 blocks away. ÊThe only downside is that they close at 10:00 PM on weeknights so expect to move it before then if you plan to stay on Broadway the whole night. Proven again and again, The House is a must-try San Francisco treat!

Finally! it was my turn to go, after hearing family and friends rave about the restaurant. My sister took my parents who knew the owner's parents (small world, that San Francisco Chinatown!) so they were treated very well. Friends also ate there and were very impressed. I took my daughter (Miss Picky Eater) and a friend for a recent lunch. I had the wasabi noodles with grilled pork which was very tasty and our friend had the chicken in black bean sauce which he enjoyed. My daughter had the Chipotle chicken sandwich and for a 13 year old who hardly eats anything other than plain foods (cheese quesadilla, peanut butter sandwiches, ham and cheese sandwiches with mayo only, milk), she also enjoyed her meal although the spicyness took her awhile to adjust! I will be back again and bringing my husband this time. He liked the food at Straits Burliingame but thought it was overpriced. I assured him that although House Êwas not cheap, it was more reasonable, and the service was friendly, not Êa hoity-toity uber-chic wear- only -black kind of place.

Often unfairly skeptical (yes, it's the market's fault!) towards hip Asian Fusion eateries, this place impressed me with its "correct" interpretation of Asia's most popular dishes, especially seafood (which is hard to master) and beef. ÊI suppose the food makes up for its so-so-blah-service, chronic over-crowdedness (the restaurant is TINY), and the inconvenient parking .... hey, at least the waitstaff is in black uniform with long aprons. ÊAfter all, I AM about the FOOD. If you're craving really good Asian flavors but prefer a Western, relaxed eating environment, The House is a good place to hit up. Hint: ÊGET AS MANY APPIES AS YOU CAN. ÊThe appetizers are all very good. My favorites: Miso Sea Bass (this dish is popular everywhere but few places make it decent... and this is one of the places that do), Bass or any fish on the specials menu (I prefer this over the seabass) Dayboat Scallops Ceasar (dressing kicks ass, but I am iffy about the battered deep fried scallops...) Braised beef

My sweetie and I went to The House for our 4 year wedding anniversary last night....and it was so yummy! There were lots of things on the small menu that I wanted to eat..I couldn't decide...but since I am 6 months preggars alot of the raw stuff was out for me ..so as soon as this baby is out I'm hitting them up again for the raw seafood! Anyway we started off with 2 small plates..which didn't seem that small but thats the way I like it:)...1st was lightly "tempura" white shrimp salad with avocado, pears and a lovely sweet dressing..and 2nd was this huge crab cake again lightly fried and so creamy and full of flavor on the inside I couldn't believe it was crab! ÊFor dinner I had flat iron steak with wasabi noodles and kimchi slaw..my husband got the sear ahi tuna both of us kept saying "mmmmmm" as we ate. Our server was great I think he was the only server for the whole place but there was alot of other staff to fill water, bring out food, etc.. also the place is small so make resos! We didn't feel rushed nor did the service lag. ÊThe only thing that wasn't mmmmm worthy was the dessert we ordered..apple crumb ala mode... is was just okay..not enough crumb topping and the apples needed more spice or something..but they did have lots of other desserts to choose from so maybe we'll try something else next time? half star off for the dessert and parking in that hood is nightmarish so half star for that but if you go early its alittle easier. for 2 people with 2 apps 2 meals and 1 dessert.. and a pot of tea..dinner came to $75 not including tip.. a must check out place!!

If we want to be anal retentive: 4.5 stars. Consistently damn good food with a strong Asian bend. Lunch prices are very, very reasonable. Mains, shared appetizer and beers for two people came to 45$. Maybe I'm insane, or the yuppie has gone to my head, but it seems like a pretty good deal. Dinner is considerably more expensive, but with a fuller menu and a more interesting set of specials.

Isn't it always the smaller the restaurant, the better the food? The word's out because this place is always packed and if you don't have a reservation (like I didn't last night), you might be waiting up to an hour for a table. They offer intriguing Asian fusion dishes. Last night, we shared the sea bass with green beans and noodles, spicy steak with noodles and mushroom rice with prawns between three people. ÊEverything we tried was delicious and it was fun to sample each dish. The one dish that surprised me was the mushroom rice with prawns. It was exactly like a mushroom risotto and seemed a bit out of place at The House, but was tasty nonetheless. However, I don't think that I would order it as my entree because it was quite rich and cheesy. My recommendation-- get a reservation, you'll be glad you did.

One of my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE asian fusion restaurants. My favorite and the one I ALWAYS keep coming back for more is the Salmon Wasabi House Noodle dish. However, I tend to come during lunch time. The lunch time dishes are less pricier versus dinner (its says $$$ on yelp but at lunch it would probably be a $$) Lunch is great because its just enough people to have a good time. Plus you don't feel rushed to not dilly dally at your table because someone might be waiting for you to get the hell out of there... I have been to dinner and it is MUCH more crowded. DEFINITELY suggest making reservations or at least come when its just about opening. When I went for dinner it was when it was opening time so I only had to wait 20-30 minutes. However, my friend who went another time didn't make reservations and he had to wait 2 hours. Also the crappy part is this restaurant is at North Beach so it is DEFINITELY going to be hard to find parking. I tend to just muni down town and walk up to NBeach. This is also not really good for groups especially during dinner time. It's pretty small. It's best to have at least 4. 6 might be a little hard, do able, but hard.

I brought two out of town guests here about a month ago. Although we had to wait forever (even w/ reservation) and the environment is a bit claustrophobic, the food made up for all of the discomfort. I had the infamous seabass and it really was all it's hyped up to be. I loved it! Next time I plan on coming with just one other person and a very empty stomach. Yay!

I went with a group of friends to have dinner here; there were 5 of us, and unfortunately any group over 4 people is just too much for this tiny place. ÊWe made it work, but it was tight. The food here is great, as noted by the other hundreds of reviews. ÊFor starters we ordered the scallops. ÊWe each got to eat only one, but damn it was good! ÊI ordered the Angus Rib-eye Steak - thoroughly enjoyed it! ÊThe mashed potatoes were lacking in flavor, but the side sauces helped to kick it up. ÊAll 4 of my fellow diners got the pork chop, which they raved and raved about pre-meal and post-meal, since a few of them had eaten here before. ÊWe also shared the coconut creme brulee. ÊIt wasn't that good; couldn't even taste the coconut. Now, here's the bad stuff. ÊWhen you are seated, they give you a small plate of pickled cucumbers to munch on while you wait. ÊThere were five of us, and they gave us one plate. ÊWe promptly devoured it, and asked if we could have another. ÊOne of the waiters told us it would be an extra dollar. ÊAn extra dollar? ÊReally? ÊThis is such a simple thing to do. ÊWe look over at a party of 2 next to us, and they also got one plate of the cucumbers. ÊBut we were a party of 5. ÊDoesn't that constitute 2 plates? ÊI don't know...really lame on their part. Secondly, the wait staff here is really bad. ÊOur waitress couldn't even pour a beer right; she just dumped it in a glass, leaving my friend with more foam than beer in his glass. ÊI mean, come on. ÊHer attempt at pouring a bottle of wine was no better...spilled wine on one of the plates, and just wiped it off instead of getting a clean one. Really good food, but don't expect much from the staff. ÊAnd if you want an intimate meal, this is not the place. ÊBe ready to share every conversation with the diners around you.

Without making it sound like my age is somewhere in the triple digits, I have to say that I was a huge fan of The House when they first opened (was it really over 8 years ago?). ÊThe seabass was always spot on. Ê Was it still as great as I remember? ÊAfter all, they say that memory if the first thing to go...or is it eyesight. ÊI forget. For whatevever reason (*cough*incapacitationbylackofparking*cough*), I don't venture to North Beach too often. Ê After reading the numerous 4-5 star Yelps, I felt that a revisit was in order. Ê I dragged my chomping buddy along and after finding a space only a quarter of a mile away, we popped our heads into the tiny space of the House. ÊA half hour wait for a table was lazed away with Grey Goose Poire on the rocks just 3 doors up. Ê ÊWhen we came back, we were promplty seated and the memories of more youthful days came flooding back. Ê Our service was spot on. Ê Our server had a party of 13 to serve along with about five other 2-4 top tables. ÊWe never felt neglected and had a great meal. ÊThe oysters arrived with a bit of additional DNA (i.e. a strand of hair) and was quickly zipped away - not only was the hippie oyster (i hope you realize that i almost wrote "hairy oyster", oops, just did.) replaced, but, a whole new plate was brought out without any question - and slurped down in seconds. ÊFriend's crab cake was really really good. I had the black cod -- it was crispy on the outside and juicy yumminess in the center. Ê The seabass was as good as I thought it would be. ÊDessert was a melty apple crisp and an outrageously dense chocolate cake.... a wheelbarrow to tool around North Beach really would've been a topper to the night. I can't think of many places that you can go back to after 5 years and have it still be as delicious as you remember. ÊThank you to the owners/chefs/staff of The House, rock on!! ;)

The food here is phenomenal. ÊAnd if I say that... well, it must have been REALLY good since I'm a hard critic. Ê Appetizers: ~ Crab cake - the presentation is unique and quite beautiful, reminded me of a pear - texture was good, not as course as some crab cakes (but some prefer it that way) - flavor was good ~ Deep fried salmon roll - I don't like wasabi... and this thing was doused in wasabi laced sauce... but even then i thought it was palatable - Salmon was perfectly medium rare -- nice and tender Entrees: ~ Black Cod with California Roll Special - not a regular dish at the restaurant... but I thought it was the most wonderful fish I have ever eaten in my life - Perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth - The flavor tasted like miso; it was delicious!! Ê:) ~ Grilled Sea Bass - I thought the fish was cooked well, maybe a little more well done than the black cod (so it was less tender) Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant. ÊParking is a pain to find though. ÊAmbiance is okay... it's a big squished and can be loud (since you're so close to the people around you). ÊIt is SF though... everything is closely packed.

Most likely one of the best meals I have eaten in a few years. Everything on the menu is very creative and does not lean as much toward the Asian side of fusion as I expected. The appetizers were all very shareable and the entrees were very decent sized portions. I expected things to be a little smaller since the ingredients were so top shelf but nope. I definitely suggest a reservation and taking a cab since the parking here is nonexistent for under $20 The food came out fast and hot. The wine list is not too large but very accommodating to the menu items. I love this place and will be back... most likely on a weekday or for lunch to avoid the insaneness. The sea bass was SCRUMPTIOUS ! The steak was cooked PERFECT ! The staff was nice and helpful !

Great meal, very homey (hence the name?). ÊTucked away on a side street away from the chaos that is North Beach, is The House. ÊMy friends had told me about how much they loved this place, and I can see why. We had the scallop appetizer that was on the specials list that night---mmmmmmm! ÊButtery, melty perfection. ÊSince I felt a bit vegetable-deficient this week, I ordered us some asparagus, which was quite tasty as well. ÊMy entree was the ahi tuna, which had the right amount of searing on the outside, leaving the raw goodness on the inside. ÊI loved the flavorful with a little kick but not too spicy wasabe sauce. ÊMy bite of the sea bass was yummmmy also. ÊAnd then came the dessert---perfection. ÊChocolate cake that was rich in flavor, but surprisingly light, sitting atop some coconut cream, topped with coffee ice cream. ÊAwesome. The service was ridiculously fast. ÊIf they have to scoot away our app plates to make room for the main course, something wasn't timed correctly. ÊWe were wondering if they were trying to boot us out as quickly as possible. ÊI shouldn't complain about prompt service, but this was a bit weird. ÊLuckily they didn't bug us to hurry the f up when we were eating dessert, or to pay the bill, etc. ÊAnd, we were sitting by the window, which made for some interesting entertainment at times, but left us feeling gawked at during others, so if I have a next time here, I'd prefer to sit a bit further back. ÊAt least there was no draft. Overall, excellent experience food-wise. ÊIf the service issues we had are improved, this could easily make my 5-star list.

I went to The House for a nice birthday dinner. The House is a small place and not quiet. They placed an extra chair for a group at the adjacent table, which was already very close in distance to our table. It felt like my boyfriend and I were having dinner with a third person. We tried the special appetizer, a soft shelled crab. It was soggy and not very flavorful. I had the salmon, which was good. I understand that fusion cuisine is difficult to make well. I'm willing to pay for good food and atmospere, but The House was disappointing in both respects, which made paying the big bill more difficult. I'd rather go to Pomelo, a place that makes cheaper and more flavorful Asian fusion dishes.

The House is a pretty tight squeeze its definitely not a good spot for parties or groups (4+) its clean, modern, sleek, but no excessive decor. they have a short and sweet menu. and they start everyone off the a mini cucumber salad just to wet the appetite. my boyfriend and i ordered the following: appetizers: maine crab cake with pickled ginger remoulade deep fried salmon roll with hot mustard main: warm wasabi noodled with angus flat iron steak niman ranch pork chop w/ pomegranate currant sauce the presentation of the dishes was really cute and the portions were a lot larger than i had expected. the crab cake was good, but the salmon skin roll was amazing (and ive had my share of salmon skin rolls). the wasabi noodle and steak were also good, but the pork chop was absolutely to-die-for. Êi dont even like pork. it was tender, not too fatty, and the currant sauce was just sweet enough. SO good.

Went there for dinner with my girlfriend on Sunday. ÊOrdered BBQ Oysters as appetizer and they were so rich that they almost knocked me out of my conscious. ÊI almost had my girl friend to keep me sober by slapping me. ÊSad enough, she had been waiting for that day to come...anyway... The Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy really impressed me. ÊThe garlic ginger soy tasted like typical 'hoisin" sauce but the sea bass was in the league of its own. ÊFresh and tender are understatement. ÊIt was perfectly cooked which I could enjoy the delicacy of sea bass and its texture. ÊThe noodle and string beans which came with the sea bass was sauteed with in house gravy and sesame. ÊOverall, thumb up! The Mushroom rice with grilled prawns was creamy but a little bit dry on the rice. ÊOn the other hand, prawns on the rice were fresh and they felt rubberly (in a good way) and juicy when I munched on them. Ê With all the hype and price, Im glad to review that The House does live up to the expectation. ÊI had a great experience with their service so it's definitely worth dropping by for a meal if you haven't done so.

Never failed to amaze me. ÊSeriously, I have been there on numerous occasions and that place never fails me. Here's what we had. Fried Chicken liver with salad - Liver was not gamey and was very well seasoned. The salad was a little bit over dressed but was not heavy. Wagu beef salad with papaya, tomato, cucumber- it was a little under seasoned but it tasted pretty great because the wagu beef has very intense flavors. Skate with black bean sauce - it was the perfect savory dish of the night. The black bean sauce did not over power the skate and the skate lightly fried to perfection. Grill prawns with mushroom rice - very Italian dish because the rice was like a risotto - creamy and al dente. :D Grill yellow tail with California sushi roll and caviar. - ÊThe yellow tail was super moist with a very crisp on the outside. YUM! Mango tapoica - Mango is not in season but they manage to find very flavorful and sweet mango puree and mix it in to creamy tapoica pudding. It was heaven :D

I took Adam here for his 20th birthday. For the appetizer dish, we shared the deep-fried salmon roll with Chinese hot mustard. I anticipated this dish the most because he always bragged about how delicious it is. He was right, it tasted amazing. However, I wasn't a big fan of the Chinese hot mustard. It reminded me too much of wasabi. For the main entrees, he ordered the rib-eye, while I ordered the Niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce. The thick cut of pork chop was cooked perfectly and the sauce complemented the meat well. His rib-eye was also cooked perfectly - it was so tender and juicy. The mashed potatoes that came with it had the right amount of fluffiness, not overly whipped or mushy. $70 including tax and tip. It might sound kind of pricey but this is probably (hands down) one of the top three restaurants I have ever ate at.

We had reservations at 6pm on a friday night which was a good because by the time we left, the restaurant was jam packed. When seated, they bring out julienned peices of sweet pickled cucumbers. A nice refreshing taste in your mouth while waiting for your food. I love how they offer a variety of hot teas to drink. It instantly warmed me up on a cold SF night. The Classic Calamari appetizer was like any other calamari you'd order at a typical restaurant; nothing outstanding, but a nice start. I'd recommend the Deep Fried Salmon Roll (w/ spicy hot mustard) as another appetizer. My bf normally doesn't like salmon, but he loved the roll. Be careful not to dip it in too much mustard because they put a good amount of wasabi in it so if you're not expecting it, your nose will feel almost like you've been snorting crack with Whitney Houston. The Grilled Seabass w/ garlic ginger soy made me extremely happy during and after eating it. Such a generous portion and also came with string beans perfectly cooked and warm sesame noodles. The seabass was seared just right and not over-cooked. This entree is a winner. The Mushroom Rice w/ Grilled Prawns was good even though it didn't have a hint of asian flavor in it. It tasted more like a delicious buttery Italian dish for prawn lovers. The Mango Tapioca was one of the best desserts I've ever had at a restaurant. Such a pleasant and unexpected surprise. Parking is tough. I don't normally love Asian Fusion places but this one is memorable.

We went to House for dinner a few months ago and I am STILL thinking about how great our meal was there, so I thought I'd add my $.02 on here. From the outside it looks like a random little hole-in-the-wall - we missed it the first time we walked by. ÊOnce inside, we saw that the reviews are all true - it is tiny, and a little cramped, and kinda hot. But we came at the tail end of the dinner rush (we called earlier in the day and had no problems getting a reservation) and got an awesome table. ÊThe waitress was super nice, and had a great wine recommendation. Ê My bf ordered the raw oysters appetizer and I tried the ahi tuna tartar - so delicious. ÊFor entrees we had the sea bass and the sesame soy glazed salmon and both were perfectly prepared and delicious. ÊThe service was excellent and prompt and the price was reasonable (although not as amazing as I was expecting, given the reviews on here). Still, I would highly recommend if you're looking to escape the North Beach Italian-food scene. ÊGreat little place.

My favorite fusion restaurant so far, and I tend to avoid them. Love the ambience of the place at night with the fellow diners. I brought my unsophisticated coworkers during a conference, and everyone loved the food + desserts. I don't chime in on highly reviewed + rated places to be another of the homering masses... but I wanted to yelp the Coconut Creme Bruleee was amazing. I still want another one, it was that good. I licked the whole damn bowl clean. And I begrudgingly allowed my coworker to sample a spoonful. I considered making him regurgitate it when my selfishness kicked in. In fact, I went the next day and discovered they sold them all out. Darn you city dwellers, leave some for us out-of-towners!!!!

Please be advised: I've been told I'm quite racist and prejudice against Asians. That being said, I found the food at this restaurant to be exceptional, if not aptly flavorful and inventive. We had a 9:30 reservation and arrived at 9:25 to a packed and crowded restaurant which was excellent to see on my first visit. My BFF and I needed a good meal after a long day of not eating and the 9 hour flight from the east coast and were not disappointed. The wait unfortunately dragged onto 9:50 when we finally got sat but not without the door constantly swinging open and hitting various elbows, hearing the loud obnoxious Carrie Bradshaw clone pretend to be intelligent only to engulf the conversations of the diners, and uncomfortable glances from diners in the restaurant already enjoying their meals but feeling the eyes of the owner trying to get them out. But but but-the owner did apologize every 10 minutes and promptly seat us when there was a table available. Our server greeted us right away, forgot some of the specials (but we're not going to hold that against her) and placed a lovely salmon tempura appetizer with a wasabi sauce that kicked my butt compliments of the house for the wait. We ordered a Ahi appetizer with an arugula salad which was sooooo good and perfectly seasoned with sprinkles of dried seaweed. The dressing on the salad was light and delicate and did not overpower the dish at all which greatly impressed me. Special of the night featured a grilled Halibut with mussels, oyster mushroom, cabbage in a fish broth paired with a simple bowl of rice. i won't tell you I took my time to savor 'cause I didn't. From start to finish, the combination was so perfect I didn't want to lose momentum and between bits of conversation, the food disappeared. My friend however came down with a slight stomach issue and we had to leave before getting dessert which I'll try next time. His only saving grace was the Pelligrino they offer in Êa liter bottle. While I happily chased around a lychee in the bottom of my iced tea glass, he held his poor stomach in and we had to leave abruptly. Overall, the service was right on and not overboard or overbearing. The food was excellent and presentation was fun and incorporated small details I appreciated. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who's in the North Beach area and please make reservations.

OK, the food was fantastic~ We are party of 9 and we had most of the main dishes, and all of them are very delicious. we had the deep fried salmon roll and calamari for appetizer. Nothing to complain 'bout the food. But why 4 stars? The service. These people don't know how to smile. It's such a small place, so packed. And the lady who served us simply spilled out everything that she had memorized. They would keep coming to refill our water. But seriously, their service made it hard for me to finish my dish.

Took my sister here for lunch. ÊGot a table without any wait or reservation at 12:45pm. ÊThe restaurant was 3/4 full. ÊWe were originally sat at the table next to the window but was later asked to move...whatever. The lunch menu looks just as appetizing as the dinner menu. ÊWe didn't have to debate for long but the daily specials threw us a curve ball. ÊWe didn't change our mind on the appetizer - got one of their special instead of the fried salmon roll although we both wished we ordered that too. What we had: big eye tuna sashimi served with finely chopped red onion, capers, few sliver of chili pepper w/ 2 pieces of seaweed, a dallop of wasabi tobiko. Ê5 generous slices of sashimi was served over paper thin sliced of cucumber. Êthe tuna was so good, it melts in the mouth. avocado unagi sandwich w/ a side of mixed green salad - this was so delicious. Êthe bread was buttered and grilled with a nice crunch and the center was piled with large pieces of unagi and avocado with lettuce and tomato. Êeach biteful was sinfully good. Êthe mixed green was tossed in a light miso flavored dressing, very refreshing. homemade wasabi noodle w/ grilled salmon - the salmon was grilled to perfection with the center still pink, every bite was pure heaven. Êthe noodle was a bit choppy and i didn't taste any wasabi flavor. Êit was also a bit on the oily side but it was flavorful. for dessert, we had one of the specials - cheesecake w/ mixed berries and cream. ÊThe cheesecake was ok, a bit too dense but I loved the berries - strawberry, blackberry, blueberry - all were so sweet. Bill came to just over $40, a great deal. ÊBest yet, my sister was very happy and it was great catching up with her.

The House... is an example of what is so phenomenal about San Francisco... I wanted to go a restaurant that I haven't been to before and I was so happy that my date agreed to my suggestion. ÊSince he hasn't been to this place, it made even more enjoyable to experience this highly-reviewed restaurant (by Yelpers). We were both impressed by the presentation of the dishes. ÊWe shared everything as we always do... which I love, because we get to taste a bit of every dish. ÊWe had the tuna tartar, salmon egg roll, and crab... can't remember if i got the names right, but they were all appetizers that were absolutely delicious. ÊWe then shared the sea bass... which melted in your mouth. I could not give my review 5 stars, because I did not care for the desert that we ordered. ÊCreme brulee was just ok. And although it was in the heart of an eccentric neighborhood (North Beach)... it was too small of a place; tables were too close together. ÊBut we did make friends w/ the table next to us... so I guess that's part of the charm of it as well.

NOTE: it is open on Sunday even though it says on the yelp iphone app it's not. What we got: Seabass (comes with same noodles as the wasabi noodles, different sauce) - the noodles were a bit salty, it's the lo mein nooodles though yum. Seabass was tasty, and grilled to perfection, wish it came with a different dipping sauce though. Wasabi noodles- comes with cut steak on it, it's really good! Dash of wasabi taste on it, but I would say this was the best thing we ordered. Deep fried Salmon Roll - eggroll looking thing. warning: use dipping sauce sparingly, it has a strong wasabi taste that might make you cry like a little girl. Chicken Liver & Salad - not that great, deep fried chicken liver, nothing spectacular, normal tasting salad with no special dressing, get something else on the menu. It's a quaint little place, they told us we had an hour before they needed the table back since we didn't have a reservation. They didn't rush us though, everything just moves at a fast pace there as they clear out your huge plates on their tiny table. One detail i thought was really cute, was their placemats. They punched little house stamps into them. Clever! Overall, it was good, a bit too saucy for me, but a nice place to try while you're in North Beach and want to get non-italian food!

I have a feeling the night I came, it was a bad night because all the reviews for this place look great :/. To start off, it was hell trying to find parking and when we got to the restaurant, they "lost" my reservation. my friend and i had to wait a good amount of time to get a table but luckily, we were seated at a window table :). From what I remember, we ordered a lottt of food. neither of us were impressed. the salmon wasn't good, ahi tuna wasn't great, noodles were average, beef was average. The only good thing we had was the Êscallop appetizer. the wine was terrible, which makes it suck that much more. anyways, the food was mediocre at best, but i'd give it another try just in case

This was one of my favorite places for Asian fusion that I have tried in SF. ÊI visited SF this past weekend and a couple of friends recommended this place. Ê It's a small restaurant w/ very little tables. ÊLuckily, we came in before the lunch rush so we were able to get a table for our party of 6. ÊAfter we sat, the lunch crowd came in and every table was filled. Ê We started with the salmon egg rolls. ÊI'm not going to lie, I was a little reserved about trying it b/c I don't like sashimi type fish. ÊThe salmon was actually seared, and pretty much cooked. ÊIt was much better than I thought it would be. ÊI would definitely order this again. I ordered the sea bass. ÊAlthough a little more pricey than most of the other lunch options, it was hands down, the best dish of our entire group. ÊThe ginger sauce was light on the ginger and the ginger pieces sort of fall to the bottom; so, since I don't really like ginger, I completely avoided it. ÊThe sea bass was served on a bed of shanghai noodles and string beans that were both done just right. ÊThe sea bass was well flavored and not dry.

Helloooo scallops... tender little scallops. ÊMy mouth is watering just thinking about them. ÊThey were covered with sprouts and a light sauce and were oh so good. ÊAn appetizer special, but are a must have if they are available. ÊThe cod was also excellent. The space is small, though, and it felt a little bit cramped with our party of six. The location great if you like being in the heart of crazy North Beach, but don't drive - especially if its pouring rain and the night before the Chinese New Year Flower Fair. You might find your car wedged to the left of the vendors' tents, driving the wrong way down Grant.

I've come here many a time.... the HOUSE is such a refreshing place..amidst the heavy olive oiled italian joints just down the street. Ê Sometimes the plethora of Italian restaurants down kearney seem to drown each other out and cannibalize a bit. the House is right around the corner and is a welcome change up. It's a cozy place..again..the size of a large condo. ÊSeating is very limited and almost elbow to elbow. Ê the food is prepared very well w/out watering down different ethnic foods to compensate for being "FUSION". the crowd favorite is the grilled chilean seabass. Ê Seabass is a very delicate and light fish that they serve w/some tastey garlic noodles and a nice sauce. People rave about the Pork Shoulder dish..(Grace K)..but since I don't eat Pork, I can't speak on that..and will have to take people's word for it... A smattering of people come here. ÊLots of diferent demographics..but overall..similar to the PF CHANG crowd. Ê the only difference is this food is actually WORTH coming to. I've been here for dates, special occasions, double dates, birthdays, and did I mention dates? Prices are reasonable (25-30 per plate) and is definitely worth eating compared to some stuffy steakhouses.

The House has always done me good in past years. I've been here a number of times for dinner and the food's always been great. This time decided to try it for lunch. The unagi avocado sandwich sounded really strange but it tasted fantastic with the tasty fresh unagi and avocade slides on toasted bread with a special sauce. It came with a side salad but the sandwich and salad were both pretty small so order an appetizer too if you are really hungry. The curry noodles were decent but came with a curry sauce that was a bit too creamy. The wasabi noodles were also decent and definitely had a nice spicy kick to it but wasn't spectacular. Bottom line: Great unagi avo sandwich. The other dishes were just ok. Not the best I've had at The House this time compared to past times. ÊBut I'll definitely come back and try again another time. 3.5 stars.

I had the ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips for my main dish and bbq oysters as my appetizer. ÊIt was all delicious. the House is a pretty small place and very loud. ÊIt's kind of narrow...but who cares you know? ÊYou are there for good food. It was Jill S.'s birthday and she picked this place and I was so happy and satisfied. ÊUntil we left and we went to a bar (Crowbar, that is now closed) and I started to feel horrible. ÊI felt all sweaty and hot and exhausted and like I had to puke. ÊI played air hockey and I just did not feel like myself at all. ÊI had only had one drink so I didn't know what was up. I eat oysters and raw fish all the time without problems, although when I was a kid I did have some allergic reactions to crab where it made my scalp itch afterwards. ÊI have ate like 20 oysters before without having any reaction. ÊI think House gave me 7 oysters and I ate them all myself. Ê Perhaps I ate too much raw-ish seafood that night with the tuna and oysters combined, or maybe I was just sick for some other reason. ÊWho can really say. But anyways I puked all night long that night and I felt absolutely horrible. Êthe next day I wasn't feeling so great either, i was in bed all day feeling like shit. ÊEven if it wasn't their fault, I don't plan to go back to House. ÊI had too bad of Êa night that night. Ê After we left Crowbar we went to Centerfolds and I barely made it to the bathroom before I puked my whole dinner up. ÊThat is totally unlike me. ÊI never puke. ÊPerhaps it was seeing Jill S.'s vagina so much as she pretended to be a stripper letting us all know that as always she didn't have any panties on. ÊLOL, Êjust kidding Jill. Ê(Love you), lol. But yeah, Jill took care me that night. ÊAsk her...I was sick as hell. ÊMy guess is that I got some bad oysters. ÊI wanted to get drunk that night but I was unable to because I felt so horrible. ÊI think I had one drink all night, maybe two tops...and I can drink a lot. House is a beautiful restaurant and the staff is very cool. ÊI am sorry to bitch and moan...but the story is the truth. ÊI guess when you eatoysters it is a risk you take? ÊI don't know.

We made a reservation for friends who were visiting out of town. This place is always busy because it is SO tasty. When I hear Asian fusion, I'm not usually no impressed because it just seems like its two dishes thrown together, but here it seemed like the favors, styles, and ingredients were well thought out and executed deliciously!! We had 5 entrees and a couple appetizers. I don't remember the other dishes, but I had the special for the night. Skate. Never had it, but I'm glad I chose it. It was the favorite for the night. We savored (and shared ;) every dish. The sides and sauces were also gobbled up because they were GOOD, not just thrown in to make the dishes look hardy. Also the portions were a satisfying size. I always feel bad going to nice places, only to go pick up something else because it wasn't filling. I'd plan to go back =)

The House always leaves me wanting more, from the meal starter of sweet and sour pickled cucumbers with sesame seeds to their sweet selection of desserts, all is excellent. I think the way to do the House most properly is to go for lunch. ÊThe prices are lower and so is the crowd factor. My culinary standbys are the chicken breast with black bean sauce (it's served with scrumptious mashed potatoes), the wasabi noodles with pork, any fish special that sounds intriguing, the lychee iced tea, the mango tapioca, and the passion fruit creme brulee. ÊBut honestly, I have never tasted anything I didn't like. ÊAnd the artful presentation of the food adds all the more to your dining experience.

The House never fails to satisfy my cravings for sea bass, salmon rolls, and ahi tuna. I've had so many of the classics that I often pick out the daily specials instead, which are good choices as well! On any trip to The House you need to make sure to save room for 3 courses of food; your taste buds will thank you in the end. some of my absolute, absolute, absolute favorites include the steamed mussels with garlic infused broth (TO DIE FOR!) and deep fried salmon roll for starters, grilled sea bass (MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH LIKE BUTTER) and grilled ahi tuna for your entree, and the scharffen berger chocolate cake, apple pie, or anything with meyer lemon for dessert. just make sure to secure reservations before going!!

My girl Hayley...I give you props for recommending this oh so yummy place. Ê Food was great and the prices were totally reasonable. Also, if going in a group...u must must be willing to share your goodies. Here's the breakdown of our fabulous dinner. ÊWe started with the ahi tuna tartare and crab cake with pickled ginger remoulade. Both were good...not outstanding but better than most places. ÊWe also ordered a half bottle of sake. It was kinda weird to drink cold sake cuz I'm used to it being hot but hey...sake is sake. ÊNow onto the fabulousness....I had the ahi tuna w/ spicy mustard aioli and man it was freakin good. My man had the wasabi noodles with flatiron steak. ÊThe steak was yummy but the only downside was the noodles. It was good but didn't seem wasabi-ish to us. One friend has the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. Highly recommended! Everything about it was perfect. And another friend had the pork chop with pomegranate sauce. ÊI'm not a big fan of sweet meats but this worked pretty well. And finally for dessert...it was some crazy dense chocolate cake with macadamia nut/toffee ish ice cream. ÊI really don't remember exactly what it was called but you must have!

Some people say Êthe presentation of the dish is just as important as the taste it'self, Êand the House gets a 5 star in that department. Ê We came in here with some friends (for my belated bday dinner), and the place was pretty good. The dishes are very imaginative, and tasty. ÊBut also the apetizers of this place are awesome. ÊI got the baked eal apetizer, and it was just delicious. The dessert I got was just ok, Ê(chocolate fudge, and some ice scream on top), but the overrall experience in this place was really good, and prices are more of moderate, but you can easily spend $50 per person in here.

The food is great here, but stick to the seafood. ÊIt's typically prepared to perfection and is always a highlight. ÊIf you want to do meat, try the pork chop, or if they are serving it, the braised short rib. ÊI liked the Niman Ranch pork chop vs. the Kurobato one they are using now, but oh well. Ê Word to the wise: order a special! ÊThey always have 2-4 appetizer specials, 3-4 entree specials, and 2 dessert specials. ÊI am never disappointed going off the menu and trying something the chef is diggin at the moment. Ê Go to the house, you will love it. ÊIt's my go to restaurant when visitors come into the city, and I want to show them what San Francisco haute cuisine is all about. ÊThis is the best moderately priced restaurant (~$65 for appetizer, entree, dessert per person) in the city, hands down.

To be fair, I love Asian Fusion, period - which probably over-inflates my rating on these kinds of places just a touch. Ê Ê This was my second visit to The House (first was about 3 years ago I think)... I was able to get a somewhat last minute reservation for a Friday night which was great (although to clarify, please don't read this to be a bad thing, the place was packed, maybe I just lucked out). ÊDefinitely enjoyed the food - the Deep-fried Salmon Roll with Chinese Hot Mustard was pretty darn good. ÊService was so so - super eager beaver waitress (again to clarify, please don't read this to be a good thing IMHO). ÊIf I could have given this 3 1/2 stars, that would be the most accurate - all in all though, I'd recommend.

I am drooling all over my nice dress just thinking about this place. One day while bar hopping through town (early afternoon in October, sunny and bright) we decided to stop into this place for an extravagant meal to fortify us for the evening ahead. I had heard great reviews of it from a couple of different friends, people that don't even like to go out. They were booked but offered us a table for one hour. We can eat fast so what the hell. Scallops to start. Amazing. Finished a bottle of wine with...tuna maybe? I have to go back so that I can write a more comprehensive review but this place is excellent and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anybody. update: fucking fantastic. had some family in town and brought them out to the house for dinner, we all raved about it afterwards. the chicken was much better than i expected and the tuna tartar was excellent. oysters and steak were other highlights. you cannot go wrong with this restaurant.

4.5 stars actually for the excellent service I received. I reserved a table for 2 on a Tuesday night at 7:30pm. ÊWhen I arrived, the tiny place was almost packed, with a couple of tables for 2 left. ÊIt was already a pleasure browsing all the different dishes on the other tables. ÊAll the appetizers looked great and we quickly decided that we would order 4 appetizers to start with. ÊThe server did a great job in serving 2 dishes after 2 -- and complete replaced our plates and dining wares in between dishes. Mussels w/ garlic sauce -- 4.5 stars (They are actually clams, not mussels. ÊI wish the clams were bigger, but the sauce was excellent, will order again.) Tuna Tar-tare - 4.5 stars (Very nicely displayed and fresh/refreshing) Crab cake - 5 stars. Period. Ê(Will definitely order again) Deep fried Salmon Roll - 4 stars. ÊServed very hot and crispy with wasabi sauce. ÊHowever, I probably like the Firecracker Salmon Roll from Cheesecake Factory much better. After 4 appetizers, we were about half full, so we just ordered one entree to share -- which was the server-recommended Seared Sea bass. ÊI have to say the sea bass could have been seared more crisp and the fish could have been juicier for a $24 dish. ÊThe noodles and beans on the side, on the other hand, tasted really good. We finished off with two desserts: Mango Tapioca Ê(The name sounds really yummy, yet we regretted for ordering this. ÊIt's basically a creamy mix of tapioca with mango SYRUP) Coconut Creme Brulee with Passion fruit flavor. ÊThis one is a great 5 stars! ÊTry it. Conclusion: Êexcellent appetizers, cozy environment, attentive/friendly Êservice, great food quality overall. ÊFound parking after 15min. circulating around the block.

I heard it melts in your mouth... yummm but the wasabi noodles with salmon - superb! the salmon was grilled perfectly! Loved loved it.

Just two of us and we killed 6 dishes, one bottle of wine... stuffed to the max. We had the tuna tartar (good but not extraordinary), the spicy steamed clams (the special for that night, which I liked the best), and the deep fried salmon rolls (the wasabi sauce made the rolls tastier). I had the entree special, steamed black cod.... it just melted in my mouth, drool. My BFF had the sea bass miso sauce dish and I think it was better than my entree.

Wowowow this place is good. Went here for a pleasant double date - I had the black cod special and mooched off the fabulous pomegranate sauce pork chops from the plate next to me. Dang...those pork chops are one word: mouthwatering. The consistency of the meat was positively juicy, well marinated with the pomegranate sauce, and they give you a LOT of food. I enjoyed my black cod but that's because I enjoy black cod nearly everywhere. The sea bass here is also very good by the way. I would definitely make reservations - it's a popular place and I can see why.

This is one of my favorite eats in San Francisco. Came here on a triple date on a Tuesday night and was somehow able to make reservations the night before. ÊWe all made it on time and the place was packed. ÊWe had to wait 30 minutes for our table because the previous party wasn't leaving. ÊWhen we sat down, the waitress immediately told us that they were providing us a free appetizer for the wait. ÊWe hadn't complained or anything to them prior to this offer but it certainly helped make the experience better. In spite of the busyness, the service was top notch. ÊWe definitely had enough attention on us and still had an ample amount of time to just sit and enjoy our dinners. Our free appetizer was the salmon rolls which were awesome. ÊIt comes with a nice spicy mustard sauce to complement it. ÊWe split two ahi tuna tartare with nori chips and a roasted eel roll. ÊThe tartare was a little spicy (good for me but not for my fiancee) with wasabi. Ê The roasted eel roll was really good and I would order that again in the future. ÊIt was fairly big too. Ê For our entrees, I ordered the porkchop with pomegranate currant sauce. ÊMy fiancee ordered the sea bass. ÊWe both thoroughly loved our dishes. ÊThe House does an extraordinary job of presenting the food and giving great portions. ÊMy porkchop was so good that I almost licked the entire place clean. ÊThere wasn't a trace of food left on it. ÊThe same could be said for the sea bass. Ê We paired our meal with a Malbec from Argentina. Ê The entire experience was great and I will be back again. ÊIt was really surprising to see how busy they were for a Tuesday. ÊPeople were still coming in at 10pm, although the place wasn't completely full. ÊIt makes me wonder how busy they must be on a weekend. Ê Make reservations and enjoy!

After seeing The House on Check Please years ago, I finally went and wasn't disappointed. The place is super small, so definitely make a reservation. If you walk-in, the wait can be 20 minutes or more. The prices can be steep, about $25 per entrŽe, but the portions are so huge and filling that you'll be feeling sorry you ordered appetizers. Appetizers are OK, but the stars really are the entrees. I was the only one in our party to not get a fish entrŽe, darn you wasabi noodles and flat iron steak, and I was definitely jealous. The House cooks their fish beautifully. Everything is buttery and flavorful. ÊIf you go, order any fish dish and you won't be disappointed. Dessert was OK, but like most places in the city aren't anything exciting. We had the mango tapioca and it was just OK. Service was OK. The hostess/waitress seemed a bit frazzled and wasn't welcoming. The busboy never spoke a word. He would just come by and fill your glass or take your dishes. I'd say thank you, but he never acknowledged it. So, while service isn't as bad as most Asian places, it's not on par as other Asian-fusion places like Straits.

Diner here for lunch and had a pleasant experience. ÊWas lucky enough to snag the table in the window which was great people watching on a warm, San Fran day. ÊThe food was really tasty - started off with the Green Bean tempura - cleverly arranged/stacked like a Lincoln Log house with the pickled ginger dipping sauce hidden in the middle. ÊThe beans were hot and crispy and the pickled ginger sauce was delish. ÊI selected the main course of steak which was very tasty, although I didn't expect the 'mushroom' sauce that came on top to be yellow (guess it was mustard based). ÊThe chunky mashed potatoes and sauteed greens which good compliments. ÊAlso tried my companion's salmon which was very yummy as well. Looking forward to going back!

We had dinner here last weekend, and I must say that it was superb. ÊStarting with the appetizers -- seared scallops, and hamachi, both of which were covered in a clovery-type green and were really nicely presented. ÊAs entrees, we got the Angus ribeye, which was done perfectly to order, and the grilled sea bass with wasabi noodles, which could not have been too much better. ÊDessert was the red velvet cake, which though a bit on the heavy side was just fine. The downsides of The House don't really have to do with the food. ÊFor instance, we were told to be there exactly on time or lose our reservation. ÊIt's small, verging on cramped, and the decor is not particularly charming; and because it's small there is a pressure on people to eat and promptly leave. ÊAlso, I hate trying to park in North Beach. ÊBut the meal definitely made it worth it, at least this time.

Came here on a busy saturday night, and the service wasnt even too bad. we had a reservation and the waitress made sure we got a table by our reservation time. Their menu is small and simple, but at the same time, adds a great deal of variety being that it is one of those "fusion" restaurants. It is a rather small restaurant, so it does tend to get a big congested in there, to the point where you can hear your neighboring tables' conversations and cheesy first date pick up lines (also a great place for a date). Onto the food, I had the wasabi house noodles. The noodles were very flavorful and came with very tender, well-seasoned strips of steak. the combination of the two worked perfectly, the sauce in the noodles also went great with the steak. Before this, we decided to get one of the "small" dishes which was still totally worth it given the portion size: the deep fried salmon roll. And by deep fried, I don't mean covered in thick bready batter. this batter was light and still added a great wasabi flavor which also came with a savory dipping sauce and side of spicy salad. Overall, the place has small spacing, but the food more than makes up for it. Definiately something you would want to check out if you are in the bay area and would like to eat a nice restaurant with 'fancy' food but would still like to keep a somewhat low budget. The uniqueness of the dishes here make it a one of a kind dining experience in sf. A tip I can give you is to make your reservations early and to bring some tissue for your nose if youre planning on ordering the wasabi dishes.

I just have to begin by saying that I have never been a fish lover. I actually defined the day I officially became an adult as the day I ordered fish at a restaurant. It didn't happen until sometime last year, at the age or 24 or 25, and it was this restaurant that compelled me to do so. I couldn't believe what I had been missing. There is one rule, and one rule only when going to this restaurant: ORDER THE CHILEAN SEA BASS. (Although come to think of it, I'm sure the other dishes are good too. I just can't get past the sea bass.) The sea bass arrives on a dish neatly doused in a garlic ginger soy marinade, with a side of noodles. The teppanyaki-inspired noodles are just right, and they put this dish over the top. I heard somewhere that Chilean sea bass is now an endangered species, so upon my second visit (also last year), Chilean sea bass had become just regular sea bass. It was still deliciousness.

My favorite restaurant in the whole wide world. I been eating at THE HOUSE for the past 7 years. With the economic so bad, i try to come here at least once a month. I always get the Deep- fired salmon roll which is really good and also the roasted unagi with avocado sushi rice. However, it does taste somewhat like a ROCK and ROLL. But it is still very good. The Warm wasabi House noodles with angus flatiron steak is also very good. You can't really taste the wasabi that much. Also, if you don't like steak you can change your order to salmon or pork. The grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy is also a plus.. For dessert, i usually get the apple pie or the passion fruit creme. Sometimes they have specials like the peach cherry pie cobbler with ice cream. I always end up leaving my tummy satisfied. I recommend going during lunch because the price is cheaper and during dinner it gets really pack and loud.

Why are there so many good food establishments in SF? ÊI'm missing the city even more as I'm catching up on reviews. We came here on the first night of my visit to SF. Ê Just about everything on the menu caught my eye but I stuck with the highly recommended Wasabi Noodles & Flat Iron Steak. Ê Like everything I had in SF, I dream about it. The wasabi noodles sounded like they'd be overpowering with the wasabi flavor but no, they were so good & well-balanced the steak. I don't really care much for the service. ÊThe waitress had the "it's all serious business" attitude but whatever, as long as the food was spectacular it really didn't matter.

I really hate to update this review with something negative because the food is really good at the House. ÊHowever...the service, not so much. ÊI had such a great time the first visit I made to the House that I was really excited to take a girlfriend here for a BIRTHDAY dinner last night. I made reservations five days in advance since I recalled how busy and tiny this restaurant is. ÊWe arrived right on time for our reservation and the hostess kept trying to confirm my name and number while we waited for about ten minutes. ÊShe then approached us and told me that they don't have our reservation and she basically doesn't know how to help us. ÊI told her that I was really disappointed and I pretty much got a "that sucks...sorry," response. Ê Moments later, my friend and I decided to walk all the way down to 5A5 in the financial district in our heels and dresses, in hopes that we could spare the night and get dinner elsewhere. ÊRight as we get to 5A5, the hostess at the House calls my cell phone and says, "Oops...so sorry...we found your reservation after all...come back!" Ê Just based on principle and the fact that we had already walked ten blocks in a different direction, I declined. ÊI won't be going back....what a shame.

Had dinner here on a Saturday night. Called for reservations the day of for party of 5. Earliest available slot was 9pm so we took it. The restaurant was tiny and the ambience was nothing special but the food was outstanding. We had several appetizers. A couple of us ordered the sea bass. Talk about melt in your mouth! We tried some of everyone's dish and everything was outstanding.

Anyone that can make food dance has my vote. I ordered the prawns and mushroom rice and, take my word, it swayed to the music when the waitress placed it on the table. The dish was topped with dried shavings of something, and I think the heat melts it? (Yes, you're right -- I probably should have asked what was moving on my plate before eating it, but whatev -- it tasted good.) Oh, and the tuna tartare... serious flava, friends. Our waitress was a doll, and we were seated right on time, despite the fact that it was a packed Saturday night. The House is such a treat -- ÊI wish it was in my 'hood.

11/1 - update I want to give it 5 kabillion stars just for the pork chop and pomegranate sauce, GOD, it's soo good --------------------------------------------------?---------------- It's ok if this place is the only reason you live in North Beach. I don't know why I don't come here more often, it's like a little treasure cove, filled with asian fusion dishes, sparkling with delicious glazes. This is the good stuff. The tuna tartare is tarrrriffic! haha, ok, I'm sorry. Ceviche was the special of the night, girlfriend loved it, reminded her of Mama's fishouse on Maui(which by the way I recommend to everyone and anyone, get the after work cocktail, 1 was all I needed!), I on the other hand was much more attracted to the fried chicken liver salad. ÊWho knew chicken liver + Fig = tasty? ÊThat's some serious imagination there, I really admired the owner of the restaurant, there is definitely true creativity going on in that kitchen. Ê As for the main meal, cutie GF got the SeaBass and gave me the O face all night long. ÊI got the pork chop with Pomegranate sauce, and O'ed her back. Ê Let me tell you just how unbelievable that pork chop was, I'm not messing around, this pork chop changed my life. ÊFirst let's just start with the basics. ÊGrilled Pork chop, simple yeah? all you gotta do is keep it moist, and make sure it's fresh. ÊDone. Next is the sauce, the pomegranate sauce from heaven. ÊIt's like a highly sophisticated BBQ sauce, think...cowboy with an english accent. ÊTogether...ohhh.....Now, let's move on to the mashed potatos with the chinese mustard sauce, mustard? mashed potatos? what the? yes, weird, and oddly, flavorfully orgasmic. ÊLast we have the thinly fried plantains, perfect width, perfect crispiness, and perfect combination. ÊAdd all of those wonderful things together and you get life-changing bite. Ê It's been a while since I've had such inspiring food make reservations, otherwise you're going to be drooling for a while

The food is good, but not great. Crab cake - too wet, not enough crab, but still tasty. Flat iron steak - I wouldnt order it again, it was nothing special. ÊMeat was tender but not necessarily seasoned. Sea Bass - was well grilled and seasoned but the ginger soy sauce on the side did nothing for me. ÊFortunately you dont need it. Coconut Creme Brulee - dessert is obviously not their forte, the brulee was still cold, the sugar atop was burnt and the passionfruit puree overwhelmed the coconut in the brulee. Overall, I would come here again if someone wanted, but otherwise, its prob not going on my list of regular places I crave....

From San Diego and went here on recommendation from fellow Yelpers. Went on Valentine's Day and had our 20 month old. The plain white placemats were key for our daughter to draw on. Also, the waitress brought over some crayons as well so she was kept busy the entire night. We had the farthest table in the back, the one with the booth seating, so that was important. They had 1 high chair, but we didn't use it. Food service was very quick. The seabass was excellent (we both had the same dish), the calamari plate was good (not Êfried, and rather small), the tuna tartare was very good. Overall it was enjoyable, the staff was very friendly to our youngster, the food was good, service consistent, however price was rather high. Two entrees, two appetizers, single glass of wine and a beer came to $105, add $20 for tip and it was $125. Would go back, but on special occasion only. Cafe Trieste across the street was a gem of a find. Great for after-dinner espresso.

Consistently solid at lunch time (I haven't been for dinner). ÊI think this has to be the best value around town for a very nice lunch. ÊPlenty of places could charge $4-8 more per dish, especially in north beach along columbus. Ê I rotate between the 3 noodle dishes, the wasabi noodles, the udon in broth, and the curry noodles. ÊWasabi gets my vote most often, with the salmon. ÊBut no companion has ever complained. Usually we go as a group of 6-8 from work, and it can become difficult to hear each other in the space which bounces a lot of sound around. ÊThe interior is fairly sparse otherwise. ÊIt has an austerity and efficiency that many 'Asian' restaurants try to imbue, but House has food worthy of focusing on. Ê Service is smooth and helpful. Tables are a little cramped at times, but for the lunch prices, you can't really fault them.

I'm so over this classification of restaurants: ASIAN FUSION What qualifies a place to be labeled this? Let's see, a somewhat Chinese dish lay it on an oversized plate, make it look cute and price it four times what its reallly worth. If this is what your into then this is the place for you. Don't get me wrong, there was absolutely nothing wrong with this place, referring to the food and the service, I definitely rate those high and also didn't run into any roaches, thank goodness... but if you're into Chinese food, like real chinese this ain't the place for you (or me).

Incredible! I didn't have a reservation, which was a bad idea. We ended up waiting over an hour to get a table. But it was worth it. Excellent wine selection and the dishes are very reasonably priced for a chic fusion joint. My friend and I went a little later (9 or 10) and the crowd seemed like mostly 20 somethings. Chocolate truffle cake was amazing! P.S. if you're waiting for a table, be careful not to stand near the door, as it swings inwards. There were several people who got hit by the door while I was waiting!

As you can tell by the reviews, this place is a MUST if youre visiting San Francisco. Everything that I've tried here has been great and I love it how they are so creative with their food presentations. The waiters and waitresses are super friendly. and i give them mad props because this place is ALWAYS crowded with many people waiting to be seated and they still keep calm and smile :) the only thing that this place needs is MORE room. the place is too small to accommodate for all the people who want to eat here. it does have a nice, cozy feel but not enough tables :( This place is definitely worth it to wait but it WOULD be nice if we could get seated faster.

The food was good, more than asian fusion i would say chinese food fusion, because most of the dishes we tried were chinese flauvored, like the pork chops,the steak, the cod with noodles, etc. The food was good, really nice, but the service wasnt Êgood enough , we made at reservation and we had to wait for almost 30 minutes in the little entrance, we felt like sardines, then when they finally gave us the table, the waitress wasnt very friendly, for this kind of restaurant you expect good food and good service, we had the first but not the second one

Wow! ÊThe pomegranate pork chops wins the SUPER STAR entree award for the evening. ÊWhen the waiter told my boyfriend and I that when he first started working at The House, that was his dinner five days in a row - I knew that was going to be MY dinner tonight. For about $20 bucks, you get a real piece of art and one damned delicious piece of meat. ÊThe pork chop was succulent, flavorful and perfectly complemented with the slightly sweet and savory pomegranate sauce. ÊWhen food makes me pause to enjoy all of the flavors... I know it's good. Ê Other delights: the mussels in garlic sauce and the mango tapioca dessert (the waiter's wife's "favorite" - gosh, he really knew how to hook me). ÊThe food is gourmet without the pretentious price tag - roughly $50 bucks for our total. Some Debbie downers: fried calamari didn't have too much flavor in the batter, plus I like my cocktail sauce with a spicy kick. ÊThe magic wasn't in that dish.

5 stars for the food but minus 1 star for the insane amount of salt and garlic that they put in. The sea bass is super moist and tender, and the wasabi noodles with steak is also a popular dish. ÊI remember especially liking the mushroom rice, which tastes more like a risotto and provides a plainer but still flavored complement to the other entrees. Portions are pretty big and everything is really delicious, but as I mentioned, I wish they'd just hold back a little with the salt and garlic. If you make a reservation, be on time! The restaurant is so small that they can't afford to hold your reservation for very long.

Since my initial review, I've been back 3 more times. ÊThat averages out to be once every 1.5 weeks. Whether I go for something new or stick with the dishes that I love, I never leave this place disappointed. There's never been a dish that I didn't like. ÊMaybe just thought it was "okay" but never a "meh, never again". ** Note: THERE ARE ONLY TWO UNPLEASANT/"MEH" THINGS I'VE COME ACROSS AT THIS RESTAURANT** #1 - They do not give you plain white bread with the mussel dish. ÊThe is SO BOMB that you need bread to pair it with! ÊI mean, when there's no bread I'll drink the damn sauce, but some bread would be AMAZING. ÊWell, all they can do for you is put in an "order" for bread which is just 4 slithers of garlic bread. ÊThis annoys me because a) they charge for this and b) I want PLAIN bread to taste the amazing sauce damn it! #2 - I usually go for dinner, but earlier this week I went for lunch. ÊThe waitress had a STINK FACE on the entire time. ÊNo smiles, no manners, just flat out RUDE. ÊMy cousins go all the time for lunch when the are in town from NYC and Shanghai, and they said they've always had her as a waitress and she just never smiles. ÊI don't really want to call her out, but seriously.. PLEASE PUT ON A SMILE. ÊStacy, you're a great waitress, but it sucks that you aren't very friendly and never seem to smile unless you're serving a table of friends. Anyways, back to the food. Those 2 things are my only complaints...and after some debate, I'm not touching my 5-star review. ÊYelp should be focused on the food.. so let's keep it that way. New dishes that I've tried... 1. Mussels in shrimp, garlicy sauce - the sauce is SO good. ÊI'm not a fan of mussels, but the sauce is too good to pass on. ÊWorks out well that the company I'm with love to eat mussels. ÊThey can have the seafood and just give me the bread to dip..-- BRING YOUR OWN BREAD. 2. Grilled Prawns + Mushroom rice/risotto - YUM! ÊNot usually a huge fan of mushrooms, but this rice was sooooo good. Had a hard time keeping my fork out of the boy's dish. 3. Sea Bass - the noodles weren't so salty this past time, so this dish has grown on me... except I don't LOVE the ginger soy sauce.. would prefer going for the meat or something else. 4. Halibut special - sauce isn't actually very spicy (not that I like spicy) and nothing to write home about. Pass...(unless you LOVE halibut) 5. Sesame Salmon - YUM! ÊBut I'd still prefer meat over fish. ÊI'll always take an animal with 4 legs over seafood. ÊThe sesame flavor was delish - my tiny little cousin liked this so much so finished the whole damn thing..which is pretty impressive for her. Okay this review is already too long. ÊLet me just say this. ÊI don't give a lot of 5 star reviews..but this place and Chez Maman in Potrero Hlil are currently my 2 favorite restaurants. I never leave either place unsatisfied.

They probably do not need another review, but here's my update anyways. ------------ Pork belly- YUM. Be sure you make the perfect bite: some pork with the fat, half an egg, half a tomato, some potato, and top it off with the cucumber salad with a slice of pickle and you will be AH-mazed by all the textures and flavors that feel like a controlled circus in your mouth. Mmmmm.... The Salmon is as always, great. Cooked salmon here is like you've never had it before. I was thinking to myself most of the time I was eating this that I WISHED I had a spoon to drown my Jasmine rice in the flavorful sake broth only to realize in my crazed House state that it was right next to me covered by the rim of the plate the ENTIRE time! All those bites without a bath of sake broth almost made me sad. Almost. The special of the night was Kobe beef and that was pretty good too cooked to medium rare perfection and really juicy. ------------------ *NOTE: Be sure to ALWAYS make a reservation. We made one for 5:45PM and we were one of two parties. 25 minutes later, the restaurant was packed.

I like this place but I do think it's overrated. I've had some decent meals here and I've had one really mediocre one as well. The Good: - most of the food is pretty good (albeit incredibly salty) - good variety on the menu The Bad: - insanely crowded (to the point where you get the feeling your server is trying to rush you out) - seats are uncomfortable - did I mention that the food is salty? The way people talk about this place you'd think it's going to be the MOST AMAZING MEAL OF YOUR LIFE. Maybe it's me. Maybe it's that I don't love fusion as a theme. It's good, but when you take in all the other factors, I don't know if it's worth braving it...

amazing food. After a week I'm still in awe of how much I loved the food. walking in I noticed how small this restaurant was. they were so busy we werent able to get a reservation for two and decided to just go and wait the 45 mins. well worth the wait. we ordered the crab cakes, the pork chops and the sea bass. everything was delicious and I especially loved the presentation and ingredients used. thin fried plantains and Êtaro chips were used in the presentation, very creative. Êpomegranate seeds were used with the pork chops. pomegranate seeds, out of all things. I thought it was pretty stunning and offered just the right amount of sweetness. the sea bass melted like butter. grilled to perfection with a side of garlic noodles and string beans. everything was amazing. a bit on the oily side but I didnt mind since the food was just that good. excellent food, highly recommended.

It is with a heavy heart that I give The House 2 stars. After an inspirational "Check Please!" and glowing compliments from friends, I wonder if my expectations were too high for this Asian Fusion restaurant. Ê The evening started off with a fantastic mushroom soup. Ê My boyfriend had the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy (we can see why it is a favorite!). However the green beans were only OK, and the dish could have gone without the chow mien noodles. I took a risk on the special of the day because it had many elements I liked (Pork Shoulder, foie gras and miso soup) and it was recommended by the waitress. ÊWhile the presentation was impressive, there was a lot of fat on the pork and the foie gras was too gelatinous for my taste. ÊThe fatty bits got lost in the miso moat at the bottom of the bowl, and it just felt like a big oily mess. ÊI was so disappointed and turned off by the fat, that I couldn't even order dessert. I hope one day to go back and experience The House that everyone raves about.

I took my boyfriend to dinner at the House to celebrate his birthday. ÊIt was the first for both of us, and my expectations were especially high from all the praise I've heard about this place. [ FIRST IMPRESSION ] I was anticipating on taking him to a semi-fancy restaurant, but was immediately disgruntled by how casual the setting was. ÊThe chairs were 100% wooden and uncomfortable, and they used individual paper table settings. ÊI felt like we had stumbled into a random restaurant in Chinatown that actually happened to be in the middle of North Beach. I let out a sigh, and decided to let go of my snooty perception of the restaurant before giving the House my final judgment. [ DINING EXPERIENCE ] For appetizers, we shared: - ÊPan-seared day boat scallops: This was my favorite dish of the night, as it was cooked perfectly from inside out. ÊThe scallops were incredibly crisp on the outside, but slowly melted in your mouth as you continued to devour the buttery greatness. - ÊOysters on the half shell with spicy cilantro mignonette: ÊOysters were good, but not the best that I've had. ÊMy suspicion was that the mignonette sauce was too overwhelming. - ÊCaesar salad with crispy scallops: This was one hell of a salad. ÊI'm not a huge fan of greens, but throw in scallops and I'm satisfied! For dinner, we ordered: - ÊAngus rib-eye steak with teriyaki & Êgarlic butter: This was my main dish, which I regret ordering after trying the boyfriend's sea bass. ÊIt's not that the rib-eye was dire, but it was so over-the-top drenched in garlic and butter that you couldn't really taste the natural meat flavors. - ÊSea bass with garlic ginger soy: Hands down - this is the best sea bass I have ever tried. ÊI take that back. ÊThis is the best FISH I have ever had. ÊSimilar to the day boat scallops, each bite left me dazed and yearning for more. [ FINAL JUDGMENT ] I would've gladly given the House 5 stars, but after finding a HAIR in the garlic ginger soy for the sea bass, I lost my appetite and (developing) interest. ÊIt's like going on a first date - you can't forget a bad impression! ÊThe thought of someone else's hair in our food lingered in my mind throughout the night. ÊAnd although the waitress attempted to make it up to us with free dessert, it just wasn't enough to make it up to me - the snob. ÊIt also didn't help that our waitress was inhospitable and remote from beginning to end. BUT - service aside and the-hair-in-our-food aside, the food was pretty outstanding. ÊSince the restaurant is so dark, I just recommend that you sit by the window so you can see if there's hair in your food!

Even if it's just lunch, you should make reservations. ÊOur group of 6 people ate here around noon and it was still mellow, with a couple tables open. ÊBut as soon as it hit 12:45-1pm, the place was packed and people were waiting. I tried 3 things: 1. Fried calamari, 2. Deep fried salmon rolls with Chinese hot mustard, 3. Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. ÊFor #3, I had to go against my nature and get this purely based on Yelpers' recommendations. ÊI wanted the Unagi Avocado Sandwich SO BAD! ÊAnd in many ways, I still regret my decision. ÊThe reason being that I've had really amazing sea bass before so the silkiness of the fish wasn't a surprise, it was a requirement. Ê Along with that, there was some stir fried udon and Chinese green beans and the type they used was something I rarely eat at restaurants and more at home. ÊThat gave me some comfort. ÊAnd with your typical fusion dish, there's always a lot of sweet glaze/sauce but at least this was on the side. The one thing that I liked was the Chinese hot mustard that came with the salmon rolls. ÊThis tasted slightly different from the kind you get at dim sum restaurants but I liked their interpretation. ÊThe salmon wasn't so bad either - everyone enjoyed this. ÊThe calamari, well, is calamari. You should really come here to see the hostess - she looks disheveled in that apathetic, secretively hippy way. ÊTo sum it up, it's like the Cheesecake Factory type Asian dishes with a Canto touch.

4.5 stars So this past Êweekend, we had a small bachelorette party for my BFF, the first dinner of the night was at The House. ÊWe called the morning of to RSVP a table and if you want a decent time call in the day before or something, because at 11a.m. we were offered at first 10pm then a minute later we were offered 9:30pm and that's for 4 of us! ÊWhen I say it's a small intimate place, it's a small intimate place, nonetheless, that made the food so much yummier!!! That night we had 4 dishes and 1 appetizer.

Calamari: ÊNothing spectacular, but it was good. ÊThe batter was very flavorful, loved the seasoning. Flat Iron with wasabi noddles - I must say at first wasabi noodles turned me off, but when my friend order it, and i got to try it, i wanted to switch with her! It was soo good! so delicious!!! ÊI still crave it. ÊI mean I literally wanted to just order the noodle itself! ÊThe beef was a little dry and plus my friend asked for a medium and it was more medium rare... Rib Eye - I loved it...i can care less for the potatoes, if I knew I would ask for the noodles instead! ÊBut the meat was cooked at it's perfection, medium rare was what I asked for, medium rare is what I got. ÊIt was soo juicy and full of flavor...it was like a party in my mouth! Salmon - this is the dish in the broth. ÊThis is probably where the half star played a part, that dish was "eh" ..it was alright. ÊI think the broth was a little too much. Pork chop - now this was the perfection dish... To die for! Moist chop beautiful sauce that complements the meat so well! Overall this place was delicious and service was great! Loved our waitress Ly she was very helpful Pomegranate. pork chop -...ok hands down, this was the best dish. ÊThe sauce was perfect with the pork chop. The meat itself wasn't dry, and normally I wouldn't order pork because of that, but they did it with such perfection here Êthat I can turn into a pork lover!!! We didn't have any room for dessert, so no comments there. ÊWe had a very Ênice server named Ly. ÊShe loved LA food and we were telling her how we loved SF foods. Ê If I lived in SF, I'd probably visit it once a month or every other month...it was a bit pricey, but you are getting what you are paying for!

Came here twice: once for my friend's b-day and another time with my cousins and friends. ÊI am amazed by the quality and taste of the food both times. I tried the following dishes: Appetizers: ÊMushroom soup-- Êvery creamy, rich, and flavorful. ÊDefinitely recommend it. ÊHamachi (one of the special of the day)- very good; more like a salad. Ê ÊSteamed Mussels in broth-- great, flavorful broth ÊClassic fried calamari-- deep fried calamari with different type of batter; good dipping sauce and salad on the side (reminds of kimchi). ÊDeep fried chicken liver with baby greens-- a very good salad; the chicken liver did not taste like liver Ê ÊCaesar salad with crispy scallop-- the ceasar salad was wonderful and the deep fried scallop made it distinct and unique. ÊAhi tuna tartare with nori chips-- very good Ê Main course: Mushroom rice with grilled prawns-- the rice and sauce was a bit on the rich side and heavy. Ê Niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce-- this is a dish i would definitely recommend! ÊPork chops are one of those meat that is hard to cook because it can get dry easily. ÊI ordered the pork chop cooked medium and it was perfect-- not too dry or undercooked. ÊThe pomegranate sauce compliments the meat very well. Ê Angus ribeye steak, housemade teriyaki, toasted garlic butter-- steak is not different from other restuarants. ÊIf you are going to order this, i highly recommend the pork chop. Grilled Hamachi (one of the special of the day)-- a bit on the dry side, Grilled black cod (one of the special of the day)-- definitely seared to perfection. ÊCooked just right. Highly recommend as well. Dessert: ÊTheir desserts are very tasty as well. ÊShould try their special desserts of the day. I would definitely go back to this place again. ÊHave not been disappointed the two times I came. ÊFood flavoring is consistent. Only drawback is that this place may not be good for big groups over 6 people since the restaurant is not that big.

Wow - the food is good. ÊFor some reason much better than what I remember five years ago when I ate at the Irving and 9th location (R.I.P). I had sea bass with the garlic noodles which was excellent. ÊVery flavorful. ÊHighly recommend it. ÊFor dessert had the Sharffen Berger chocolate cake served with macadamia brittle ice cream which was just as good as my entree. The only note - service was a little off - from walking in to be put on the wait list to ordering and even paying.

This is one of the best restaurants around. ÊThe atmosphere is almost perfect for everything. ÊIt is a very small and intimate place with several tables that are close together. ÊThis makes it a cool place to talk to your neighbors. ÊOnce shared several rounds of sake with the table next to us. ÊIt doesn't have to be loud. ÊYou can go here on a date and be completely absorbed in your date. ÊIf that date is your boyfriend of many years, that is hot too. ÊIt's not hard to tune out the surrounding noise. ÊThis is merely a great place to hang and have a nice casual dinner. ÊThe lighting is also nice for a daytime lunch. I have had many intimate evenings here, some too intimate for comfort. ÊThis place is a San Francisco landmark for me. ÊThis place has charm. I recommend anything seafood here. ÊAt night it gets crowded and you have to wait a while for a table. ÊPeople are literally spilling out the door. ÊThis makes the service a bit quick. ÊDon't expect to hang here for hours over a glass of wine. ÊThey drop your meal, you eat it, and get the heck out. ÊThat's what makes it so casual and so unerringly San Francisco.

The House never disappoints. Ê It's been a while since I've been here, but the service is still exceptional, and the food is great. ÊJust as I remember it. ÊI had the deliciously cooked flank steak with warm wasabi noodles - yummy. Ê Yes, the menu is California fusion, and in general I am not a fan of fusion food. ÊGiven the choice I'd usually opt for authentic, but The House is definitely the exception. ÊThey do fusion really well. ÊThe flavors are not strange together and the meat is always cooked just right. ÊI get medium rare when I order medium rare. The House is usually packed, and only fits about 50 people, but I was pleased to see that there were several families with small children having dinner there tonight. ÊWhy shouldn't kids also enjoy good food?

Sometimes I walk around North Beach like an old man and point to restaurants and shops and say ," I remember when that place used to be ____. And now it's ____ . " But for the life of me, when I look at The House, I can't remember what used to be there... Then it comes to me, The House, has been on that same corner for a very LONG time. And I am just NOW trying it out. And after trying it, I can see/taste why it's lasted so long in such a tough part of town in which to compete, and received so many great reviews. For starters, I enjoyed the Ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips, it was spicy, flavorful and not bland, like most tartare I have had. We also had the white shrimp tempura which I thought was delicious, but on the small side. Their scallop special was TAS-TY! I can only hope that when you visit, they will have it on the menu so you can try it for yourself. And for my main dish, I had the warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak, which I found to be tasty, flavorful & not too wasabi-ey, and a good sized portion. While I may not be coming back for dinner anytime in the near future, I may pop back in to see if their lunch offerings are just as good...

This review has been long overdue. My bf took me here for my 29th birthday in May. I asked him how he found out about this place...and to my surprise, he said he "yelped it" and found great reviews on it. That made me so proud. lol So we made a reservation for Friday night around 8:30pm. With all the stellar reviews on this place and given how small this LITTLE HOUSE was, it wasn't surprise that it was extremely packed when we arrived. We were seated in the back, close to the kitchen. It was tight and difficult to maneuver to and from our table. It was also very noisy. Don't come here for a quiet romantic date. The tables were just way too close together. We were getting a kick out of listening to these dirty old men talk about getting "happy endings" at massage parlors they frequent. Ugghh. The convo was quite clear....that's how close we were to them! We started off with the deep fried salmon roll. I liked the rustic presentation of our dishes but the taste didn't quite impress. For our entrees, my bf had the ribeye steak and I had the sesame soy glazed salmon. These were also just okay. Maybe it was an off day for them...I don't know. But we probably won't be back.

Came with a party of 2 on a Monday night. Empty when we arrived but it was pretty early (like 6pm) and by the time we left, it was hoppin'. It's a smaller space with echo-y floors to be advised that if the place is packed, you're going to have to yell to hear your tablemates. Here's what we ordered: Bean Tempura: Very good - Nothing says lovin' like fried vegetables served built-up like a log cabin. Fried Calamari: Standard fair but why not add fried seafood onto fried vegetables if we're going for broke, right? Sea Bass: Good texture, flavor and was well cooked. Loved the Japanese mushroom udon on the side. Ribeye: Lord daz alotta meat. Alot of it fatty but I still had some left over. Cooked perfectly (so many non-steakhouses default to medium well when asked for medium rare). Mashed potatoes were a little whatever. One thing I will say is that it seems like all the sauces are really salty. I mean, I love salt but the sauce for the fish, bean tempura and even my teriyaki ribeye dressing seemed over the top when combined altogether. For dessert we had the coconut creme brulee with passionfruit puree and the apple crumble a la mode. Oh and a bottle of the bubbly if you can count that as dessert... can't remember the name though - like the more expensive of the 2 champagnes listed (baller, i know). Service was very attentive but I have to say that our waitress was kind of cold. Not that I expect to become besties or anything but this chick was all business. Might be nice for a bit of back and forth before we get down to brass tacks? Probably would have ensured a 25% tip instead of just the standard 20%. But I'm nitpicking at this point - really I did enjoy The House and will come back.

Fab food in a smallish, cozy environment. The waitresses never smile. The fact that we were 10 minutes late with an extra guest and carrying plastic cups half filled with wine must have made us all the more annoying to the waitstaff there.

House was super-hyped up by all my friends and co-workers that I was worried it wouldn't meet expectations. ÊHowever, it truly is that wonderful. ÊThe food is amazing and so pretty to look at. ÊIt's a small place to it's wise to make reservations or come really early or late in the evening. ÊParking is a real pain so it's better to just take Muni or use a garage. The waitstaff is very friendly and efficient. ÊAlmost too efficient; we had a three course meal and were out of there in an hour. ÊWe didn't feel rushed, but you could tell the servers have been serving the same things for a while and knew the menu pretty well. ÊThey did have a few specials, but they were too complicated for the waiters to recite properly, so I think it would have been better if they were printed on inserts in the menu. We started out with a glass of Riesling for myself and my luver had the black lychee iced tea that came with refills. ÊI really liked my wine and felt it matched well with the food we ordered. ÊThe menu isn't large, but it was really hard to decide what to get since so many things looked appetizing. For the starters, we had the deep fried salmon roll with hot mustard sauce. ÊFor some reason I had it in my head that I was going to get something like an egg roll. ÊInstead, we got long whole pieces of salmon (skin-on) with a light friend coating. ÊIt was terrific! ÊI'm normally not a fan of hot mustard, but the dip was really good (if you used just a bit). ÊToo much and it burns your nose. ÊWe also ordered the crabcake. ÊIt was pear-shaped - very unique! ÊIt was very good and I loved the lemony oil that was drizzled on the plate. For my entree, I got the sea bass. ÊI had read so many good things about it. ÊI was thrilled that it came with two of my favorite side dishes....green beans and noodles. ÊThe sea bass wasn't the best I have ever had, but it was still very good. ÊThe fish was tender and moist. ÊThe green beans were sauteed in a savory brown sauce with a hint of garlic. ÊThey were crisp and perfectly cooked. ÊThe noodles were really yummy, too; they were thick like udon and very chewy. ÊMy luver had the Angus rib-eye steak. ÊIt was one of the BEST steaks I have ever had. ÊHe asked for it medium rare and it came out simply perfect. ÊThe meat was so tender and almost melted in your mouth. ÊThis dish came with a side of mashed potatoes and bok choy. ÊThe mashed potatoes tasted strange to me, but who cares...the steak was awesome!!!! For dessert, I had the special: strawberry and burnt orange upside down cake, which I liked a lot. ÊMy luver got the chocolate truffle cake with coffee ice cream. ÊThe cake was super thick and rich. ÊDelicious! The bill post-tax/pre-tip came out to $100. ÊAlthough it wasn't cheap, I felt it was reasonable for 2 apps, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, and two drinks. ÊThe quality of food here is superb. ÊThe portions at House are generous as well. ÊI felt stuffed after my meal, but in a good way. ÊI can't wait to go back and try some more items on the menu.

First time here today. We were told we'll have 45 min wait, so we went off to a nearby bar. They called us in about 15 min. So that was a good start. Food was excellent - we ordered the Sashimi, Bbq Oysters, and Kobe steak. The wine was good - but not inexpensive. There is no ambiance here - for the prices, I expected something more than a hole in the wall kind of place. Service was alright - not bad but nothing special. Come here for the food - and of course the location. No other reason.

ABSOLUTELY delicious! I read up on my yelp reviews before heading over. I took my babe out to a congratulatory-new-job dinner and it was a total hit. The highlights of the meal were the Ahi Tuna Tartare and the Apple crumble dessert. ÊI love tuna tartare, and The House made it inventive and delicious. I've been trying to skip dessert lately, but we were celebrating. If you love more crumbs than apples in your Apple Crumb pie, then this is going to definitely hit the spot. ÊI loved it! As for the rest of the meal, we also ordered the scallop appetizer which was good but not momentous. My boyfriend got the Skirt Steak with wasabi noodles. We both noted that there was nothing wasabi about those noodles. I ordered the famous sea bass and, agreeing with the rest of the reviews below, it was done to perfection. The noodles and green beans that were on my side were a little too greasy for my taste, but the fish was perfect. Ambiance was cool, we got the seat next to the window and had early reservations so it wasn't uncomfortably packed. All around, it was a delicious meal and I would recommend it to anyone.

Can't decide whether or not this is my favorite or second favorite restaurant in the Bay Area. ÊI believe it's in the North Beach area in San Francisco but all I remember is that it was 2 doors up from a strip club. Ê Despite the "not so fantastic" area and the cramp space you have to dine in the food was FABULOUS. ÊI don't' know how they do it but the main course dishes we ordered were almost UNBELIEVABLE (I've never had a dish that I would consider UNBELIEVABLE but the dishes we ordered at the House were pretty close). Ê We ordered the Black Code and Pork Chop. ÊBoth were cooked perfectly with an amazing sauce. ÊI heard their other dishes are also FANTASTIC but take it from me, if you've never been there MAKE SURE TO ORDER THEIR BLACK COD! The overall price is VERY reasonable for the quality you get. ÊThe service is friendly overall except for the hostess (she may be the owner). She's a bit on the rude side but that could be because she's got lots of folks waiting to be seated in a small closet sized restaurant. ÊIf you're expecting a big and roomy restaurant you've gone to the wrong place. Ê I've read previous reviews and many people say it's elbow to elbow but it's not that bad. ÊI'm a pretty big guy and I didn't feel that crampt. ÊWe were definitely close to our neighbors but it was nothing to complain about. If you have not tried the House - GO GO GO!

I've been meaning to try this place after it moved from Iriving to North Beach. ÊI visited this place once when it was on Irving and it wasn't that great. ÊThe place was definitely not popping. ÊMoving to North Beach was probably the best thing they did for the restaurant. ÊI must say though, the space is much smaller, but that definitely does not mean the flavors are small. Made reservations the night before for a party of 5, for a week night. ÊThey had the table ready when we arrived. ÊThe waiter we had was clearly new, so it was slightly awkward. ÊWe ordered the oysters on the half shell, got two people who never had them to try it. ÊThey were 'okay' with it. ÊI personally, love oysters on the half shell, so it was a perfect appetizer. ÊI ordered their lychee black tea and well, it was bland. ÊIf putting one lychee in the tea makes it a drink, I guess it counts, but really really bland. ÊI knew someone working at the restaurant, so he brought me another one, with 3 lychee and that really didn't help that much more. ÊEating the lychee was enjoyable, but drinking it was a lot less...they should add the syrup from the canned lychee. ÊWe also ordered the ceasar with fried scallops as another appetizer to share and it was a good basic ceasar salad. I ordered their roasted chicken breast with portabello mushrooms and the skin was nice and crispy, while the chicken was still moist. ÊThe mushrooms were also very yummy. ÊThe rest of the party order the mushroom rice with shrimp, the porkchops with pomegranet (spelling?) sauce, and the sirloin steak. ÊAll of the dishes were very well prepared. ÊGreat flavors with contrasting textures. ÊWe however, did not stay for dessert. Despite the drink lacking flavoring, the rest of the meal overall was wonderful. ÊI can only imagine how busy this place gets on weekends. ÊReservations is a MUST.

Showed up without reservation just before the rush, so the place was empty but we got the "I guess we can squeeze you in" look...made sense because 30 minutes later the place was PACKED with a line out the door....which was a little annoying and made me feel a little rushed to finish. I had an appetizer of deep fried chicken livers, which came with a salad. I love chicken livers but deep fried they were something else. Highly recommended. My main course was grilled yellowtail fish, also excellent, with several pieces of sushi rolls. The portion was actually quite large and I felt pretty full when finished.

Tucked away amongst the Italian restaurants and bars in North Beach, i am sure I've passed this place many times without noticing it. ÊLuckily, Yelp clued me in to a little gem that serves up some great food! I ordered the sea bass, my date ordered the flank steak with wasabi noodles. ÊThe skirt steak was just ok, nothing special. Ê The noodles were very very good, maybe a notch below the garlic noodles at Crusteceans/Thanh Long. ÊStill excellent though! The seabass on the other hand....was INSANE! ÊMmmmmm. ÊNice big piece, about the size of 3 decks of cards stacked up. ÊCarmelized and crusty on the outside, tender and flaky on the inside, and served with a yummy garlic ginger soy sauce. Ê We also got a tuna tartate app. that I would give 4 stars to and finished it off with a blueberry bread pudding that I'd give 3.5 stars to. Food (4.5 stars) - the sea bass was phenomenal. ÊInstant classic status. ÊMost of the other dishes were great too. ÊSkirt steak was the only "average" dish IMO. Ambiance (4 stars) - intimate setting...not as loud as some reviews had me thinking...tables ARE very close to one another though....there's a great table right by the window, if you can get it! Service (5 stars) - our server was a little quirky (she prefaced her recital of the specials with "I am probably gonna mess this up, but here goes!")....food came out quickly.....I dropped my napkin, and our server literally had a new one for me before I could even bend over to pick it up! Overall, I'd give it 4.5 stars. ÊA really good place that I will soon visit again!

I went to lunch with two friends that love this place. I have to agree The House is awesome Êreally great asian fusion done well. For appetizers we had salmon rolls, fried calamari, and tempura stringbeans all amazing. For entrees Joyce had the warm wasabi noodles with grilled pork. It looked like ever other person was having this same dish with salmon or pork. It must me one of their more popular dishes. Aroura had the softshell crab sandwich and said it was delicious. I had the grilled chinese chicken salad ( doing the low carb thing) and it was an explosion of flavors yum. I can't wait to go back to try those wasabi house noodles.

I've been here time after time, and each time it's ALWAYS amazing =) ÊIt was once just my hubby's fav restaurant in the city, and now it is OUR fav restaurant.

Entrees I always get either the Mushroom rice with prawns, or the Chilean sea bass that comes with some really good noodles on the side. ÊBoth dishes are awesome... and I choose depending on whatever I'm in the mood for - but if I had two stomachs, I would get both for sure!! Hubby always gets the Nieman Ranch Pork Chop. ÊI always steal a couple bites, which he playfully hesitates to share with me in a kiddish way. =) It's cute and all, but I always get my way in the end!

Holy moly, what a delicious little gem. 4-solid stars for near-perfect food, an atmosphere with good energy, and a lovely wine selection. I was in a party of four, and got to try lots of apps - the dumplings and ahi tartare we're my favs. The salmon roll was a little odd in texture and density, so I would pass on that again. I went with all you great Yelpers, and got the seabass - ahhhhh-maaaaazzzz-ingggg. (It left that kind of zing in my mouth as well) My fellow diners were impressed as well - the flank steak and wasabi noodles were good, the filet special looked wonderful, but the ahi was a little on the boring side. It was surprisingly fun to be practically eating at one big community table. We had nice neighbors and it provided some fun energy. However, the tables are soooo close, no conversation is private.

Occasionally, I have people ask me for some of my favorite restaurants to try while visiting SF, and House is up there on the list. Ê House offers an eclectic mix of seafood dishes with Asian cuisine influences. ÊI love the deep-fried salmon rolls to start off, and I don't think you can go wrong with any of the seafood entrees. If you are staying at a hotel downtown, it is a quick cab ride to this restaurant. ÊThis is a great spot to go with a friend, date, or small group, just be prepared that it could be crowded, so see if you can make a reservation.

This place puts all other Asian fusion restaurants to shame! The ingredients are fresh and everything's quickly and precisely prepared, and the service doesn't skip a beat -- but what I loved most was the creativity of the cuisine. The best tastes, ingredients and preparations of Asian cooking are given an innovative twist to make them modern, while still retaining the qualities we know and love. Like a crispy seared mahi-mahi in a smoky broth that you soak up with steamed rice...or comforting chow mein noodles punched up with a hit of wasabi...or a Vietnamese goi reincarnated as a tart coleslaw. YUM!

The house is 3.5 stars worthy. After most people raving about it, I had to give it a try. The gf made reservations for 8 o clock, we were on time and still had to wait about 10 minutes. The place is very small, parking is almost impossible. Ended up paying $6 to park in a lot near by. We had: 1. Deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard - anything crunchy and fried on the outside is always a win. nothing spectacular. 2. Maine crab cake with pickled ginger remoulade - this app. was definitely a winner. very flavorful to the taste buds, not your ordinary crab cake. 3. Niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce - i must say there have been many times where i've ordered pork chop and it's been dry. the house makes their pork chop easy to enjoy with their pomegranate currant sauce. some sauces are paired with entrees to cover certain aspects of the food; however, the meat itself was definitely moist enough for the sauce to be left out. if i had any criticism about the pork chop, it would be that the outter layer was a bit charred.

The Wasabi Noodles...mmmm mmm good! Great food, fun ambiance, vibrant, overall awesome. The one downfall is we had to wait still about 15 minutes even with a reservation which isn't really that big of deal but wish they had a bar to grab a drink rather than wait outside.

WOW!!!! Why didn't I listen to my friends' advice earlier? This place is out of this world good. Personally, I've hesitated to try it out earlier because Asian Fusion food has gotten so cliche in recent years - chefs think they can throw in some wasabi or ponzu sauce and out comes good Asian Fusion food. Here's the ultimate testimonial: Our waiter said that him and his wife love eating at the House so much that the wife ordered him to get a job here! Crazy, huh? If I weren't a clumsy klutz, I'd work here too. Oh...we had the deep friend salmon roll, a special day boat scallop with some seriously yummy tropical sauce, braised pork shoulder with foie gras and the wasabi noodles with flank steak. Everything was packed with flavor. Enough said, go try it out!

How's this for a general policy regarding fancy (meaning $$$) restaurants that don't pay their waitstaff enough to keep their interest at providing even the semblance of professionalism in their service...and here's the thing I ask...just write your specials-of-the-day on a freaking chalkboard and hang it! ÊPeriod. ÊAnd actually let the staff, especially those that will be giving their briefly crammed oratory at least a few dozen times during their shift in trying to sell these dishes a chance to try them while the cook/chef explains what they are eating to them. ÊThat way , patrons can read (yes I can, believe me) and ask their own questions about each special beyond just "what is it?" and have intelligent answers coming back to them by the waitstaff. ÊPuh-leeze. The House is often crowded (re: lively), too small (re: cozy) and noisy (so: talk louder), with long waits -- even with reservations (just show a little patience or go elsewhere, after all, it is North Beach). ÊBut the food can be worthy of your anticipation here as it is mostly spectacular for the eyes and tasterific for the tongue. ÊA few of the regular menu items do border on the bland, so chose carefully (and this is where waitstaff knowledge and communication is especially important, especially for the uninitiated). Portion size between entrees may vary enormously too. ÊSo order two (if you have the $$$), share, or make sure the staff knows you want it doggy bagged. ÊIn fact, insist on having it doggy bagged. ÊSay it many times to the waitstaff before your uneaten portion is taken away. ÊAvoid disappointment (God! I miss that steak & wasabe noodle entree that Jim intentionally moderated (re: restrained) himself not to finish so he could save some for later -- or possibly some for his lovely wife -- but was tossed because the waitstaff had a miscommunication. ÊI miss it for him. ÊAt these prices, every delicious toasted sesame seed counts!).

Seared scallops, delish! Flank steak with wasabi noodles, delish! Sea bass, delish! Chocoate truffle cake with coffee icecream, delish! Parking, however, awful. We did manage to find a parking structure just a block away, and paid 5 bucks on a friday nite for nearly 2 hours. Fantastic! Call the restaurant for street name. If it's tasty food you want, The house will serve it. Don't expect much from the decor and service, and you will be delighted, because the food is wonderful. Very reasonable prices for such upscale plating of mouth-watering food. It's like going to a 5 star restaurant, and omitting the pretentious service and staggering bill.

The House feels like home. My friend put me with the task of picking a restaurant that she "had to try before moving away from SF". ÊAfter reading the wonderful reviews, I decided to go with The House. ÊFortunately for us, they had a same-day reservation for 3 at 7:30pm on a Wednesday night. We arrived a few minutes late, but our table was ready and waiting for us. ÊAs soon as I stepped in, I felt good about my choice. ÊThe decor is pleasant, and the restaurant was busy. ÊTo drink, we each ordered a different hot tea. ÊI got the chrysanthemum, and it was great. ÊFor appetizers, our server listed off some non-menu specials that sounded delicious... he recommended the pork belly, so we ordered that and the grilled calamari as well. ÊBoth appetizers tasted perfect... they were just the right size to share between the 3 of us and not get too full. ÊThe pork belly reminded me of a Chinese dish I've had before. ÊIt was definitely not the healthiest thing to eat, but it just melts in your mouth. ÊSo good! For a main course, I selected the sole, while my friends ordered the yellow tail hibachi and the ahi tuna. ÊEach plate arrived in a beautiful arrangement on the plate, with colors that jumped out right at you. ÊMy sole was cooked perfectly, and the mashed potatoes underneath were devoured quickly. ÊMy friends each enjoyed their dishes as well. ÊNow, it was time for dessert. One of my friends was a pastry chef, so she was particularly excited. ÊShe selected the creme brulee, while my other friend went with the red velvet cake. ÊI chose the apple cobbler (without the "a la mode" since I'm a lactard). ÊMy apple cobbler was solid, while my friends each very much enjoyed their respective desserts. ÊBeing a pastry chef, I trusted my one friend when she said the creme brulee was delicious. We never felt rushed at any point. ÊIn fact, the table of 3 older ladies next to us received their check a few minutes after we sat down and only left 5 minutes before we paid out. ÊIt was clear that this was a restaurant that wanted each party to enjoy their meal to the fullest, even if there were a few folks waiting to be seated. ÊAfter tax and tip, we spent about $52 a person... definitely reasonable for a good meal, considering all of the food we ordered. I'll be back... I think I may have a new favorite restaurant in SF!

Cozy little location with attentive staff. First time experience was great. Yes, it is a little pricey, but the portions are also decently sized. Had the calamari (mmm, much different from calamari I've had at other places), sea bass (tender, flavorful sauce on the side, comes w/ veggies & noodles - love the noodle+onion combination), teriyaki rib eye (delicious, tender medium rare, topped w/ garlic, comes w/ mashed potatoes & veggies). Also, had a taste of the flat iron steak + wasabi noodles (not too bad, but I have to say the teriyaki rib eye was best that night) I do look forward to my return! Make reservations, fills up quickly. My only gripe: wish they had better chairs & tables. If I'm paying ~30 bucks/plate, I'd like a little cushion.

Making an obvious assumption, I'm guessing it's called The House because it's been converted from one. ÊIt really is a teeny tiny restaurant, so it fills up super quickly. ÊIf you do make reservations, be sure to get there right on time. ÊIt's very popular and in my experience there has been a wait when I arrived a little late. ÊTo its credit, once sat, you'll be happy with the expedited service. ÊI added the wait staff's attentiveness as a plus to the over-crowding's negative, thus cancelling any point-docking in my 5-star review. ÊIn the end it's about the food. ÊAnd it really is THAT good! ÊReally. Ê I'm a pescetarian, which means the only meat I eat is fish. ÊI've been so for quite a few years now and believe me when I tell you that I've tasted my fair share of sea creatures. ÊIf anyone were to ask me what's my favorite fish dish, my answer would be, without hesitation, The House's sea bass. ÊIt's phenomenal. ÊThe fish is so delectably tender and flakey you'd think you were given a little slice of heaven. ÊYou don't even need to add any extra condiments to it; it's like a fine steak that shouldn't be messed with. ÊUnbelievable. ÊI'm usually a one-trick pony when I go there, so I make sure to taste my company's dishes, which come in very generous portions, and I'm always very pleased. To sum up: the tastiest meal you've ever had will be the reward for your patience.

The restaurant should consider expanding. The space is very cramped. Every time the server came over to help the table next to us, her bum was so close to our table that I thought she was going to use it as a chair and sit on it. And it felt so impersonal that her back was against us. Okay, now let's talk about the food. I got their special, seared duck with blackberry reduction sauce. The duck was placed on top of mashed potato and asparagus. The whole plate was filled with the blackberry sauce with a few blackberries in it. The sauce was so savory. Every bite I had was dipped in the sauce. The duck was also really good. However, I was given a dull knife to eat with. My friend got the wasabe noodles and flank steak (which was also bursting with flavor) and he had the same problem with the knife. The whole night, we were both cutting our meat as if we were trying to saw a tree down. I wouldn't be surprised if the people next to us thought we were crazy. For dessert, I ordered the nectarine pie a la mode. The nectarine pie was good until I had my 2nd bite, there were blackberries in it too. The combination of blackberries with nectarines was a little odd. A bite of the sweet nectarine with the crumbs and a little bit of ice cream all together was very enjoyable. The blackberry really threw me off. At the end of the night, my stomach was plump and happy. Thank you house.

I've been wanting to come year for a couple years after hearing how good the food is ... I wasn't disappointed. ÊLocated in the heart of North Beach is this gem of a restaurant. ÊIt isn't big so making reservations is a good idea. ÊWe went Thursday night at 6 pm and got in without reservations but when we left, there were only two seats available. ÊAlso, you'll be sitting close to your neighbors, which we didn't mind because we met some lovely people and got to ooh-ahh over their food, but if you want a private dining experience, this isn't it. We got the tempura fried soft-shell crab ($12.50) for the appetizer with some soy noodles. ÊWhat an impressive looking dish when it comes out - it looks like the crab is standing on the back legs. ÊThe crab was delicious, perfectly battered and fried -not over battered and greasy, but light tasting. ÊI'd give this 4 out of 5 stars because neither of us really cared for the flavor of the noodles. Ê For the entree we got the sea bass and pork chop. ÊBoth around $21/$23. ÊThe sea bass was served with sautted long green beans, thick Asian noodles, and a side of a soy ginger sauce. ÊThe sea bass was perfectly cooked - tender with a nice crust. ÊThe ginger sauce was the perfect optional side. ÊThe green beans and noodles were good but nothing spectacular. ÊI'd give the fish five stars without question. The pork chop was served over mashed potatoes with some asparagus and a pomegranate reduction. ÊThis is one of the best pork chops I've EVER had. ÊSo moist, the pomegranate reduction wasn't too sweet but complemented the pork divinely. ÊThis entire dish gets five stars. For dessert we got the apple crumb cake with ice cream (around $8). ÊMeh. ÊIt gets three stars. ÊUnder seasoned (maybe needs a little cinnamon or nutmeg) and a weird texture - maybe the cornstarch used to thicken the filling. It wasn't bad, it was just average and didn't match our expectations after the first two courses. Ê Service was good - we didn't feel neglected, they refilled our water, cleared out plates (maybe a little quickly), but it was good. So if you have a chance, check out The House. ÊI know I'll be back. ÊI'd actually work my schedule around just to go there. ÊAnd if you're from out of town, you can easily walk here from Powell shopping area, Chinatown, or even Fisherman's Wharf. ÊAlso, Beach Blanket Babylon plays right down the street.

I was impressed that this place yielded 4.5 stars from over 1400 people. Perhaps my expectations were a little too high? It was overall a very pleasant experience with very good company and pretty good food. The big drawback though, was the fact that they ran out of wine glasses. They first served one of us a dirty glass, when we asked for another, they asked for him to wait since he also had a beer. He was ok with it, but he never got a glass until we had to ask again, when he was just about done with his steak! I think he ordered the wine for his steak??... I advise against ordering the house wine (pinot) that is recommended by the staff, unless you're into VERY sweet fruity (almost dessert) reds. The pork loin, was VERY good, as was the Kobe ribeye on the specials menu.

Pros: ÊGood food! Cons: Ê Small space (reason it doesn't get 5 stars) I came here on a Sat. night (6/14) with an 8:30 p.m. reservation for 4, we added 1 more person, which meant a 4 top table w/ a chair at the end. ÊIt's a very small and crowded place to begin with, so we were cramped, but okay. ÊI'm pleased they accommodated our last minute change, but this is not the place to linger over drinks due to the minimal space leads to some discomfort. Also, they have 1 bathroom and you have to wait in line by the dish station, so wait staff is constantly squeezing by you. ÊDue to the fact that the 1 bathroom is for men and women...it's not the cleanest during Sat. night rush hour (we all know men often "miss"). ÊI'd suggest they put some candles in there so it's darker and you can't see! The food was excellent and so was the service. ÊMy friend got the pork chop over pomegranate that we all thought was the best. ÊI got the daily special of Two-faced Tuna which was grilled tuna over a mustard sauce and tuna sashimi. ÊIt was a creative and tasty dish. ÊWhite rice came on the side w/ a soy-wasabi dipping sauce for all entrees. Appetizers were Fried Chicken liver salad, which I'm not a fan of chicken liver, but w/ the salad was able to enjoy it. ÊLobster tempura salad ...good, but not memorable. ÊScallops which were large and done perfectly. Dessert was the passion fruit flan, which was great, considering I'm not a big fan of flan, but like the fruit taste! I'll definitely return to try some of the other menu items that caught my eye!

YES! Ênow, THIS was a memorable meal. Êa good degree beyond the reasonably good $6-10 eats i find from time to time during the week, this meal stood out. Êas was hoped, anticipated, and ultimately surpassed. Êdef a good idea to make reservations. Êwhen we arrived at the door for our 7:30 reservation, a gaggle of good natured walkins stood eagerly by the front door and made smiley-sad faces as we walked with the host to our table. Êi think it was another 40 minutes before they got to sit down. so, yes back to the meal...as we sat down, we were immediately drawn to the very tasty looking plates all around us at other tables. Êit was difficult to not stare at those tasty looking morsels as we plunked down into our seats. Êthe house is a small venue with slightly cramped seating, but this is north beach so we're used to it. Êour server was very quick to announce and describe the specials, while to the point and articulate, when we reciprocated her greeting with the same "...and how are you doing tonight?", she looked at us and made a pointed effort to say "OoKaay". Êhmm...weird, she must have been an indentured server at "the house". Êher attempts at pleasantries thru-out the evening looked pained and un-natural to her normal state of being. Êmaybe her batteries were running a bit low. Êah well...back to the FOOD! :-P we ordered the scallops and crab cake appetizers. Êour entrees were the pork chop and the cod(special for the eveing). Êour beverages were a glass of pinot, pilsner, and arranciata. Êa lovely surprise to see the beer and italian soda both came in full pint glasses and deliciously icey cold! Êchin-chin! :-) Êthe pinot was nice selection too. the food was served at a good pace. Êcarefully prepared, presented, and at good temps. Êa wonderful mixture of flavors and ingredients. Ênot once did we feel rushed, or in limbo. Êthe plates were distinct, and just a treat to savor. Êi love well prepared and creatively inspired asian fusion. Êremember the earlier days of "oritalia"? Êthat was my fusion awakening back in the day...all in all the house exceeded my expectations for the evening. Ê the appetizers were a real treat. Êgreat attention to detail in appearance and flavors. my entree actually arrived nice and hot, as well as my partners. Êwe love to share our food, as to experience as many plates as we can at one table ordered between the 2 of us. Êhers was just as well prepared, uniquely delightful and served fresh from the kitchen nice and hot. Êwow. Êwe both found ourselves in the most pleasant dinner scenario in recent memory. Ê for desert we shared he chocolate truffle cake with coffee ice cream. Êwow. Êi am not a big cake fan(unless its made with ice cream), but even without the coffee ice cream topping, this cake was very very good and thoroughly enjoyed. parking was not a problem for us as we know this is hectic, crowded, space-starved part of town, so we take our cute pair of vintage vespas when in this neighborhood. Êi recommend a cab, PT, or something on 2 wheels when going to north beach. Êtrying to find parking in a car will ruin your evening. Êunless you have cash to throw away at those over priced parking centers, or feel like splurging on valet, leave the car at home. the entire dinning experienced was only slightly damped by the dour server. Êwhile prompt, attentive, and articulate, she def gave a vibe of just being plain unhappy. Êwe don't know why she seemed to down, but if she was a senior staff member or evening part owner, she should be very pleased with the attendance, and caliber of food at her establishment. Êi felt sorry for her and even tried to give her a compliment on the restaurant, in which she just gave me a pained smirk and quickly looked away. Êah well...maybe she was just stressed out about not having any chocolate truffle cake to relax to at the end of her shift... the house, 2 thumbs waaay up! Êterrific food for any fusion fans out there. Ênot the absolute, ultimate best fusion i've ever had, but really pretty darned terrific, and certainly worth going back to.

My favorite restaurant of all time!!! I've tried almost everything on their menu, but my favorite is the sea bass and wasabi noodles. You have to make a special request and ask for the wasabi noodles if you are ordering the sea bass, I think it is usually paired with The House noodles which is good too, but I prefer my wasabi noodles. Best ever!!! I also get their lychee tea and Macademia Brittle dessert. When I have visitors from out of town, I always take them here. It's casual or you can get all fufu'd up too if you like especially if you have plans afterwards... walking distance to Broadway. Parking sucks in North Beach, but it's all worth it. Wish they never closed their other branch by 19th street. That restaurant is actually much bigger than the one in North Beach.

I came here for my birthday dinner last week with a couple of my girlfriends. ÊI had an amazing experience eating here! Ê I originally wanted to have a party of 10+ on a Friday night here. ÊBut eventually, I realized that was not a realistic expectation. ÊThey have a strict policy towards large parties (especially on the weekends). ÊI decided not to risk it and kept it small and intimate to a party of six. ÊI'm so glad I did that because it was so busy and crowded in the restaurant, that having anymore people in my party would have been too chaotic and stressful. Ê I knew this place would be amazing the moment I caught a whiff while I was walking by this one night. ÊI trust my senses, so I knew I absolutely had to come here for my birthday. ÊBoy was I right! ÊThe food was absolutely scrumptious. ÊI can't even begin to describe Êhow good everything tasted to me. ÊSince there was six of us, I got to taste everyone's food, and we each ordered something different. Ê Appetizers: ÊWe ordered the soft shell crab (I think it was a special) which was fried and had this delicious sauce on it. ÊThen we had the ahi tuna tartare which was also very flavorful and the presentation was very unique. ÊThe crab cake looked a mountain mound with a dried banana chip sticking out of the top. ÊWe devoured everything immediately. Ê Entrees: ÊI got to try a couple bites of my friends' mouthwatering dishes, which were the grilled sea bass, grilled ahi tuna, pork chop with pomegranate currant, escolar with mussels in coconut cream sauce, and beef short ribs. ÊI ordered the ribeye steak, medium rare. ÊIt was so juicy and tender. ÊIt isn't everyday I find steak that is so tender that it melts in my mouth as I chew it. ÊYes, steak! ÊEverything was flavorful, well presented, and all the meats were cooked/grilled/baked to perfection. ÊMy favorites of the night were the pork chop and ribeye steak. ÊHowever, the ahi tuna was not particularly memorable. Ê Dessert: ÊCreme brulee and ice cream sandwich taco. ÊSweets is definitely a must to end the night. ÊI have to say I liked the ice cream sandwich more, I think it was home made ice cream with chocolate fudge on it. Ê Overall: Ê5 stars! ÊI'm definitely coming back here for more. ÊThis place was definitely everything I expected, if not more.

Don't let the size of this place fool you, the fact that it's packed should tell you everything. I went there for the first time on my birthday and will make a point of bringing others repeatedly! The BBQ oysters were wonderfully warm and the sauce had just that hint of spice with cilantro sprinkled to perfection. I had the wasabi noodles with steak and my girlfriend had the pork chop because we had only heard great things about each. While the noodles were delicious in their own right, they were overshadowed by the couple bites of pork chop I tried. The meat was tender and spiced right and the mix of pomegranet and blueberry sauce was like heaven in my mouth! On top of the amazing food is an excellent selection of wines, cozy atmosphere, and beyond superb service. I can think of exactly zero things wrong with The House.

This place was absolutely delicious, came here for my birthday trip for the weekend and we stopped by here twice. I am not a big fan of asian fusion so when I read the reviews and said it's not like it here, we had to come by and try it, especially with all the great reviews. This place did not disappoint. Here is what we ordered - Sea bass: This was buttery and moist with so much flavor Mussels with garlic shrimp broth: We had to ask for bread to eat the rest of the broth Warm wasabi noodles with flat iron steak: The warm wasabi noodles were a real treat since they were so different in taste. The steak was OK, if you can try to substitute the flat iron steak for the ribeye, which we ordered the second time. Maine crab cake: I thought this dish was OK, not something I would order again only because it wasn't lump and I'm not big crab cakes where I can't really taste the sweetness of fresh crab. RIbeye: Absolutely delicious, tender, juicy, everything you would want in a steak. I am not a big fan of teriyaki sauce, I would suggest getting the sauce on the side if you aren't either. We ordered dessert, but I can't remember what it was. We aren't dessert eaters but after our first meal, we ate all of the dessert and the ice cream that came with it.

After 4 years of living in SF, House remains in my top 3 favorite restaurants. At this point, I've probably had just about everything on the menu and I've never been disappointed. The flavors are unique, creative, and SUPER tasty! The presentation is always impressive too. Don't try to go without a reservation, I've never seen this place empty or slow (a sign of a great place). It's a pretty cozy place and can get a little noisy at dinner when it's fully packed, but it's not too bad. The ambiance is nice.... not overly pretentious/ not overly casual. It's a great spot for a date night. In fact, whenever I've been asked out to dinner and I get to pick the restaurant, House is always my first choice. Not only to I love the food, but I've made fans out of everyone I've been there with. You can't go wrong here!

After coming here again recently, it reconfirms how much we like this place. ÊParking still sucks but the food and service is still good! this time we shared two appetizers (steamed clams and fresh hamachi sashimi salad) that were quite tasty ribeye and mash with veggies, yum! sea bass with veggies, yumx2! blueberry bread pudding, still as yum as before!

BEST RESTAURANT IN SAN FRANCISCO. Hands down. Every time i'm in the city, this place is a must visit. ÊAll the appetizers are fantastic but my favorites include the tar-tar, the oysters, the scallops, and the chicken liver. ÊThe specials are also amazing. ÊOut of the main dishes my all time favorite is the sea bass. It is the perfect amount of fish, that simply tastes amazing. I never have any complaints about the desserts, they're all house made, and all fantastic. ÊSure to enjoy this amazing dining experience.

Delish! Started with the oysters which were very fresh. I had the porkchops with pomegranate sauce while my dining companion had the miso black cod. Both dishes lived up to the hype! My porkchop was tender, juicy, and had great sweet/tangy flavors. The black cod was savory, rich, and completely crave worthy. Only downers were the drinks. Our nigori sake was unappealingly thick (bottom of the bottle perhaps?) and I thought the lychee tea lacked flavor. Overall, though, a fantastic dinner pick!

dear house, you are bland, noisy and rushed. i could have gone with a-ok if your servers had not been so lost. i was prepared better than they were to order. but before i get ahead of myself let me ask you, if i were to order a seafood appetizer and a seafood main, do you really need to come back to my table and ask me "is it ok that your appetizer and main are both seafood"? yes, it's ok, i just ordered them didn't i? if i order a vegetable appetizer, a vegetable main and a vegetable dessert then you should serve it to me. otherwise don't give me the option and just provide a set menu. i also expect to eat both my courses with a fork and put them in my mouth. should i stuff one up my nose for variety? use my napkin to lift the food off the plate to avoid using a fork twice? here's a giant hint: flavor should differentiate the courses. if the appetizer is actually the same exact flavor as the main but you call them two different things...well, then you're a lazy cook aren't you? but let's face the meal facts. shrimp was mealy. the squid was rubbery. i give you two stars instead of one because the sauces (both of them) were actually unique and palatable. there was no spice, however, and Êthey were not hallmarks of a fine dining experience. the spotty and hesitated service blocked me from getting to a 3, as i mentioned. the staff looked rushed as they ran back and forth back and forth, yet my water glass sat empty for my meal and i had to waive someone down to take our empty dishes. if you're going to rush, rush, but do more than one thing at a time. we're humans not ants. and i might as well point out the decor is uninteresting. i noticed several tables across from a giant plain white wall. opposite wall was stock photos in ye ol' walmart stock frames. be advised to bring someone attractive to look at because there isn't anything else going on visually. it's not really your fault that the people next to me also were ruining the ambiance. then again, maybe it's the kind of person you attract. i don't know. but i do know that a guy who was practically sitting on my lap said he graduated from haas business school recently has been fired three times and now wants to quickly fleece as many people as he can for as little effort as possible (government handouts, becoming a slumlord, trading junk bonds) so he can "coast through life". it made your space feel even more cramped. the punch line? he boasted of his mommy taking care of all his needs (she's watching "his" unwell dog until it dies) and of him being a libertarian in the same breath. actually, where i'm from that's not liberty. that's called being a freeloading selfish pos. yeah, i really want to hear your story instead of my friends while i try to chew through a rubbery tentacle. did i mention the space is cramped? meh. i've experienced better just a few blocks away in chinatown. and even better out in the western expanse of the city.

I had to find a restaurant for my boyfriend's birthday. The House was suggested to us by one of the 10 guests on the list. Apparently, everyone else has been here and loved it. The boyfriend and I were the only ones who've never been. The boyfriend's birthday was on a Monday, so I called Monday after 12PM to make reservations. The person who answered the phone sounded very cheery until I said "12 people for 6." "Twel-twelve people?" "Uh yes, please." "Okay..." she takes down my phone number. "Can I put you on hold for a second?" Put on hold for exactly one second. "Yes, hi, can I get your number?" "Um, I just gave it, it's 5-" "No, a credit card number." ...Who asks for credit card numbers when giving reservations? I always made reservations at other places and not once was I ever asked for a credit card number. So if I was late or never showed, what were they going to do, charge me? At the end of the phone call, I told her, "it's a birthday dinner so we're bringing a cake, is that okay?" "Yes, just to let you know there will be a cake-age fee of $3 per person." WHAT? At this point, I had to get back to work so I said okay, and we ended our conversation. We got there at 6, and our waitress for the night greeted us. I told her we had cake, and she told me, okay it's $3 per person for us to cut it for you. I said okay fine, can we cut it ourselves? She said, okay so you're going to take it to go? What? "If you're not eating dessert from here, there's going to be a charge." ARGH. Well, FINE. And then I told her that when they're ready for the cake, I have the candles. She said okay. We ordered our appetizers and entrees. The food was really delicious and I cleaned everything on my plate, as did everyone at our table. When it was time for cake, she brought out the cake with a CANDLE already on it, told my boyfriend "happy birthday" and then literally tossed the cake onto the table and walked away. Did not lead us into song, did not ask me for candles, nothing. We sang, they came to cut the cake, we ate, paid, and left. Her service sucked. Straight up. And it sucked so much that I had to tip so much because of our group size and not based on their service. It seemed like she didn't even care about our table or the occasion or anything. Would I come back here? Yes, probably for the food but not with a group and definitely not for a birthday. $3 per person for cake? The cake-age fee cost more than the cake itself! And I would probably come back for just a simple dinner, not for a special occasion. PS. I had the scallops special appetizer and chicken breast with portobello mushrooms. Delicious.

One of my favorite restaurants in SF and I go to a lot of new places. Small, intimate place so good only for smaller groups. Food is delicious and the staff is friendly. Highlights of food is the special sauces the chef uses. Sauces are Asian fusion with wasabi, soy and miso as the base. Salmon rolls appetizer is great. Fish and pork entrees were yummy. And my favorite dish is the to-die-for Scharffenberger dark chocolate flourless cake with hazelnut ice cream and caramel drizzle. Ooooo... very rich so you have to love chocolate and sweets but this is decadent, incredible and OOorgasmic!

The House is a treasure tucked away along a strip of mediocre restaurants. I've had dinner there about five times now, and lunch once - every time I have had a great experience. I would give it 5 stars if the service had a little more personality or flair. Smile maybe? But, the service is on point in terms of getting you what you want efficiently, without ever making you feel rushed. It's a tight space with many diners packed in closely together, so it can get pretty loud and hot. But it's packed like that for a reason...the food is excellent. Everything I have tried, I have loved. Each dish looks like a work of art and the portions are of good size. In terms of entrees, my favorite dish is the sea bass...very moist inside with a flavorful, crispier outside. The warm wasabi noodles with steak, and the salmon dish are also very yummy. The appetizers that have been a hit are the fried salmon rolls, the ahi tuna tartare, and the crab cakes (if you appreciate more chunks of soft crab than breading). If you are a day boat scallop person like I am, I would highly recommend getting the special if available. Perfection on a plate in a beautiful sauce. The House has definitely impressed me and everyone I have ever been there with. Really worth trying!!

ÊIf you go, be prepared to just simply MELT from the flavors and fresh fish. I ordered the sea bass and it disappeared on my tongue. I took one bite and paused it was THAT freakin good.

After scouring yelp for a place for dinner I finally settled upon this place. Once found I thought I would try and get a reservation, unfortunately the only reservation I could get was for 9:30 pm, so my date and I decided to try and just walk-up. Once we got there the hostess took my name and number and said it would be about 30 min. As mentioned in the previous posts, the place is very small. ÊThe hostess was right on though, because 30 min later she called and said our table was ready. We decided to go across the street to little cafe that wine for $3.50 a glass. Nothing great, but a great place to pass the time while we waiting. Once called, we went back to the house and were seated right away. All I can say is that it was well worth the wait. We started off with an appetizer of the scallops which were one of their specials that night. For entrees I had the Duck with Fois Gras (special that night) and my date had the Chicken with Portabella Mushrooms and Potatoes. Both meals were excellently prepared, portioned, and presented well. We could not have asked for better meals. For desert we had a piece of the Korean squash (forgot its name) pie with pecans. It as well was very good. The total bill for the evening with drinks, appetizer, entrees, desert, tax and tip came to about $110. Well worth every penny spent!

The House. One of my favorite places for food in the city. This is my go to place for a guaranteed enjoyable dining experience and for entertaining out of towners Everything about the food is amazing. From the appetizers, to the main course (The cod..sigh...oh the cod), to their amazing house made desserts, I have never been the slightest bit dissatisfied.

I didn't get the full experience of this place since I kind of wandered here by accident. ÊMy gf called me from work to go to lunch and I was looking up places near the financial district but like an idiot I ended up choosing one that was closed. ÊFortunately, my gf took it in stride, and we ended up stumbling upon The House after a walking a few blocks down. ÊWhat a happy accident, I didn't know it at the time, but I later realized we had stumbled into one of the highest rated restaurants in SF! Ê I ordered the Wasabi noodles and it was possibly the best noodle dish I've ever eaten! ÊI rarely order noodles but these were fantastic, the wasabi was not overpowering which was good because I was at the tail end of my tonsillectomy recovery and was a bit worried. ÊGreat textures in this dish with the crunchy slaw and delicate noodles. ÊThe pork was tender and well seasoned. ÊThe presentation was beautiful and not at all what I expected. ÊMy gf ordered the chicken breast which was also delicious, but not as good as the noodles. Ê So, if your boyfriend or SO happens to make a bonehead mistake, try to be a little forgiving and cut them some slack, because you never know, the experience might turn out to be a little more memorable after all.

YUMMM, I'm still thinking about the food I had for lunch today. Started off with the $10 (only during lunch) steamed mussels with garlic infused broth http://www.yelp.com/biz_É. The mussels were on the small side but the broth was so good. I licked the bowl clean until it was white, just kidding but I would have if I was at home. Then for entrees, we had $11 warm wasabi house noodles with grilled salmon http://www.yelp.com/biz_É and $10 curry noodles with grilled chicken http://www.yelp.com/biz_É. The wasabi noodles were good at the first bite because I didn't taste the wasabi but then I ate from another part of the bowl then I tasted a hint of wasabi blehh. Bf likes this one but I don't. He's had this before so I guess you can say this is his usual. I had the curry noodles, now that was DELISH!!! Bits of corn, stringed potatoes?, lots of curry sauce (just the way I like it uh huh uh huh), noodles, and chicken yummm I wish I could make this myself, I would eat it all the time. The only reason I knocked down a star are for the grilled salmon & grilled chicken. It tasted too burnt and cancer-ish. Other than that burnt taste, the rest of the food was good like DANGGG ÊI have to come back here good. I think I can only come here during lunch any day Monday-Saturday Êbecause their prices are reasonable, dinner prices are crazy $$$.

I would give it a 5-star if they actually paid attention to my reservation and didn't have us waiting as long as walk-ins. Also, the desert was just ok. The food was amazing. My pork chop was just delicious as it was just prepared right (they do it medium by default) and the pomegranate sauce was just heavenly. The sea bass that my girlfriend had was also extremely good (but I like the pork chop better).

"The House" is really the size of a house if not smaller. That's how they get their food to taste so fine. The less people they have to serve at once, the more time they'll put into making your food.

The wasabi house noodle was okay. I got it with grilled salmon instead of pork. Nothing special. I wished they made it more wasabi-sh... I expected a sting-like taste reaching my nose but I missed it from my wasabi noodle. They cooked your order quickly and that's a plus. Not sure if it's pricy. I think it's okay. At least the house noodle was priced very reasonably. If you compared it with other Chinese restaurants, yes, it may be slightly more expensive but for the quality, it's not expensive at all.

Despite all the good things that I've heard about The House, going to North Beach, with its clusterf$$k traffic and parking situation is just never appealing to me. ÊSo after calling and canceling a few times, I finally managed to keep the reservation and went there on a Sunday evening. The decision on the timing was a conscious one. ÊI've experienced enough of North Beach traffic at its finest and didn't feel like dealing with it in my old age. Ê Sure enough, we got there in about 15 minutes from the *other* end of town (SCORE) and were able to find a spot right outside the restaurant (DOUBLE SCORE). Ê What we didn't anticipate was that our table was still occupied by the earlier party, so we had to wait for a good 15 minutes before we were allowed in (the entrance to the restaurant was definitely not designed to hold a large amount of hopeful diners). ÊThankfully, though, the food came out relatively fast because all of us were starving at that point. Our appetizers were out within 10 minutes of ordering: Roasted unagi (eel) with avocado sushi rice (Phenomenal with a capital P), ahi tuna tartare with nori chips http://www.yelp.com/biz_É (good), and the deep-fried salmon roll http://www.yelp.com/biz_É (disappointingly underwhelming). Ê Then along came the entree - as soon as our plates of appetizer were cleared - and again they were a bit of a hit-and-miss. ÊEveryone loved, loved, loved the creamy melt-in-your-mouth grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy and noodles http://www.yelp.com/biz_É, as well as the mushroom rice (which was almost like a risotto, only a little drier) with prawns. ÊThe rest of the entree were just okay - the ribeye steak was a bit on the chewy side http://www.yelp.com/biz_É and the flatiron steak was just so-so http://www.yelp.com/biz_É (I now know better not to order steak in a non-steakhouse). Ê All in all, it was a good dinner - I'll just pass on the steaks next time (and recommend others to do so).

I've only fallen in love a few times in my life, and one of them is The House. I've thought about living there and maybe owning the place so I'd never have to cook ever ever again. Although, I love cooking way too much so that'd never happen. I've been here 3 times and I keep on wanting to come back because the food is just that good. Those pork chops in the pomegranate sauce is so out of this world amazing, and the sea bass with the california rolls were also delicious. The fried salmon rolls were perfect, light and crispy, a little raw and moist. The service wasn't amazing, and the place is really packed, cramped sometimes... However, it's worth it! I'd recommend this to anyone and would take anyone I love here because it's just that good! ÊOh... and the price is really really reasonable about 18-26 bucks for the entrees for what I'd call really gourmet. I'd call this place My Home.

Me and the wifey have been going here for almost 10 years (since we first started dating). This is by far our favorite spot to eat in SF. The place is a bit small and cozy but the food is awesome. The food is Asian fusion but the Asian influence is subtle with the use of Asian inspired sauces or vegetables as the dishes are very traditionally prepared. My favorite dish was the grilled rack of lamb which they stopped serving a few years back so I've been getting the seared ahi or a special (usually a fish dish) on their menu for the day. The wifey always gets the seared sea bass with garlic noodles. We always start off wid the salmon spring rolls which is fresh salmon rolled in a thin egg roll skin and deep fried quickly leaving the salmon still medium rare served with a spicy wasabi mustard sauce - yummmmm. If were not too stuff, we finish off with a creme brulee. I absolutely love this place and try to come on any special occasion that comes up!!

A jewel! ÊAn absolute jewel! I'm very picky about fusion places and I have to say the house does has a way to bring out the best of east and west on a plate. ÊI was pleasantly surprised by the efficient, top quality service and tasteful decor. Fresh seafood, wonderful taste and a delight to the eye. ( Plating/presentation was fabulous without sacrificing taste). ÊThe crabcake appetizer is a little on on the heavy side (creamy) but still held its own. ÊThe cherry that topped off this decadent ice cream sundae of an experience was the fact that it was just as good as I've heard.

YUMMY! I rarely give five stars. ÊWe came here for my Birthday dinner with the parents and while we're all foodies, we don't always want the snobby ambiance of places that think they are so great but really aren't and make you pay for it. This place is very casual and small, it's intimate but the tables are a bit too close for a romantic date. ÊWe brought a bottle of wine and I was pleasantly surprised the waiter picked it right up and began the service and then resided all the specials, more YUMMY ideas. ÊWe picked the bbq oysters and the unagi appetizer and then each picked different entrees. The appetizers arrived and disappeared into our stomachs, we would have licked the plate but we just have a little more manners than that. ÊThen the main dishes, I got the Cod, my BF got the steak, the parents got sea bass and salmon. ÊSame thing, the plates were clean and we all tried each others dishes and were absolutely blown away. ÊSome places just know what they're doing. ÊIt's very rare that the service is great, all the dishes are amazing followed by dessert. Ê Of course I got the dessert with the candle, and even that was amazing, the chocolate cake was just right, not overly sweet or rich and a nice cleanse to my palette. Ê Needless to say I'm coming back and hopefully soon:) Ê Reservations essential!

The House is one of my favorite restaurants in the bay area. If the black cod is available, get it! It's cooked perfectly. There's a lot of flavor and it just melts in your mouth. The pork chop is really good too. The pomegranate sauce is really what makes the pork chop stand out. I couldn't get enough of it. The only downside is that it's small, so the tables are really close together. You can easily hear your neighbors' conversations. I'm a small person, and I still feel like I have to turn to the side to get to my seat. Reservations are highly recommended.

I came here late on a Friday night and we were seating right away, even Êwithout a reservation. I've been hearing so much about the dinner here... Calamari appetizer- really good...very crispy and had some spice to it. Seabass w/ garlic ginger soy Ê the seabass was not as rich as most other places and had a great grilled flavor to it. It was cooked perfectly. You didn't really even need the sauce! The ginger soy sauce was a little too sweet for my taste. Mushroom Rice w/ Grilled Prawns- reminded me of an asian risotto. We were expecting a dry type of rice- this dish has a creamy/sticky rice. The prawns were delicious, seasoned very simply, which is a good thing, although I'm pretty sure you could make them just as good as home. Overall enjoyed my dinner here, but deducted start because 1- i feel like it was a little overpriced for what you get and 2- the service was just so-so. Our waitress kept trying to take away our calamari when we were clearly still working on it- did she not see the pile still left on the plate??

I come here every decade, but I should visit more often! ÊThis is a hidden gem for good eats with a refreshing variety of Asian fusion dishes. ÊStart off with their signature deep-fried salmon skin rolls with hot mustard, fried calamari or scallops. ÊThe unagi avocado sandwich and the wasabi house noodles with tenderly grilled pork is scrumptious. ÊWhether you have their crispy sea bass, tender kurobuta porkchop with pomegranate currant sauce, or angus ribeye steak with fried garlic bits, you'll be satisfied with what I call fancy comfort food that makes you feel at home without the tendency to critique food. ÊNormally, I don't drink, but their German riesling is sweet, smooth and uplifting. ÊSave room for the coconut passionfruit creme brulee with a crispy crust and delicately balanced filling. ÊThe bittersweet chocolate truffle cake topped with ice cream hits the sweet spot for sure. ÊEverything is cooked just right! Service is friendly, fast, and helpful especially when it comes to suggestions and refills. ÊParking is tough on the street, but there are local garages within walking distance. ÊThe ambiance and decor is simple with a contemporary and classic feel in a cozy, small restaurant. ÊHowever, the food is cooked with heart with flavors and aromas that fill the room to make you savor every bite =b

I've been sitting in my 100th review for months..... and the winner goes to... THE HOUSE! Ê:-D My bf, his family and I came here this weekend for a late father's day celebration. ÊI was actually expecting it to be a little more cramped ( I was thinking small like Brenda's Soul Food in the TL) this actually wasn't that bad. ÊWe were a party of five and were seated at the very last table in the back, we were pretty comfortable. For appetizers we had Kobe beef tartar and grilled calamari. ÊThe entrees at the table were the sea bass.. and a couple of his choose the specials for the evening; the Kobe NY strip and the scallops. ÊFor dessert we choose their red velvet cake, the chocolate fudge cake Ala mode, and the coconut creme bržlŽe topped with passion fruit sauce (my fave!) Every morsel of food here was sooooooo delicious!! There really isn't anything original I can say after thousands have reviewed this place. ÊTruth be told, after reading many reviews I was worried service wouldn't be great especially since it was a beautiful summer day in sf, and they were busy, but this place hits the mark on everything. ÊIf you decide to dine here make a reservation, allow plenty of time for parking and ENJOY!

I should have despised The House for depriving me of a rare opportunity to eat presumably authentic Italian food when I was visiting North Beach, but no, I can't. The food served here is amazingly good, even the boring-but-addicting BLT. I came here with my brother, and we started off with an appetizer that featured fried scallops. Though not a fan of scallops, I have to admit that they were delicious, especially when combined with the mustard sauce drizzled on the plate. For the entrŽe, I ordered a tuna BLT with wasabi mayo, and it went beyond my expectations. The tuna was perfectly cooked so that the outside was crispy but the inside was so soft that it literally melted in my mouth. It came with a small portion of salad that was splashed with the right amount of sour-and-sweet dressing, too. I also tried my brother's wasabi house noodles with grilled salmon. The boldness of wasabi and the tenderness of the grilled salmon made a perfect combination. No doubt this is the most popular dish at The House. When my brother and I were halfway through our meal, a group of people came in and they all ordered wasabi house noodles. But if the entrŽes came in portions that filled our stomach well, the appetizer came out with only 3 scallops. It was a little short of our expectations--portion-wise--considering it cost around 12 bucks. Despite the pricey appetizer, I'll definitely come back if I have a chance. Try to visit during lunch to cut your bill down to half. And make sure you call to make a reservation unless you don't mind the wait so that the food tastes ten times better.

I'm so glad we made reservations for this place. Ê The House was packed. ÊSuch a cute little place with very friendly service. ÊWhat stood out about the food and service was that even though it was packed and extremely busy, the chef was on with all of his plates - great presentation, food temp, and the quality of the dishes very apparent in the flavors and every dish came out perfect - neither under nor over cooked. ÊThe servers were very good about taking our orders, clearing plates, refilling our drinks and I could tell that they had tried all the dishes here. ÊImportant because of that they were able to make great recommendations (unlike bestbuy employees Ê=P), Ê Between the 3 of us, we ordered 3 appetizers and 2 entrees. ÊPerfect amount of food. ÊWe started with raw oysters in the half shell with cilantro dressing - 6 so 2 each, very fresh. ÊWe tried the special for Saturday, the papaya salad. ÊIt was tasty, refreshing and loved the crispy rice on top which gave it a crunchy bite and toasty flavor complimented the salad well. ÊWe had to try the customer sig dish, the deep fried salmon roll with spicy mustard sauce. ÊThe salmon was well packed and the sauce was yummy - somehow this dish reminded me of the appetizers at the CheeseCake Factory - cross between the avocado egg rolls and firecracker salmon rolls. ÊI know you're thinking - "HOW COULD YOU?" dare to compare the two places.. For entrees, we again went with the special of the night, the BBQ Kobe Beef with Shoestring potatoes. ÊKobe beef was cooked medium rare - perfect and the shoestring potatoes were so tasty. ÊI wish the BBQ sauce came on the side. ÊGreat Kobe beef should not be covered with sauce as it was. ÊWe couldn't stop munching on the shoestring potatoes even when we were stuffed. Ê2nd entree was the Grilled Sea Bass. ÊOhhhh, I can't describe how perfectly cooked the fish was. ÊI didn't even touch the extra garlic ginger soy dipping sauce. ÊPerfection on a plate. ÊDidn't care for the greens but it balanced out the food groups and loved the garlic noodles the sea bass came with. ÊThe chef and owner of the restaurant Larry and his wife have done a great job with this little gem.

Absolutely fantastic. ÊWe had reservations for four at 7:30 on a Friday. ÊWe were seated by 8. ÊOur server was friendly, but not overly friendly. ÊA nice, cozy atmosphere. ÊToo cozy, evidently, as the girl seated at the next table saw fit to TAKE HER SHOES OFF. ÊI loved the look our server shot her as he stumbled over her shoes and then kicked them back under her table. WTF is wrong with people? This is the third person I've seen take their shoes off in a restaurant. ÊOh well, at least she didn't take her napkin and wipe her bare feet off like I witnessed in the sushi restaurant. Ê Oh yeah, the food. ÊWe started with the fried salmon rolls and the tuna tartare. ÊThe tuna tartare was mouth-wateringly delicious. ÊThe salmon rolls didn't do much for me (they seemed a little dry) but everyone else at the table went wild for them. They did come with a deliciously spicy wasabi sauce that redeemed them considerably. We then split three entrees. ÊBased on the recommendations here, we had the sea bass, the pork chop with pomegranate sauce, and the hamachi special that had the sushi rolls on top. ÊThey were all wonderful. ÊThe pork chop was thick and really juicy, cooked perfectly in a delicious pomegranate sauce. ÊI highly recommend this dish, but really, I thought they were all excellent. ÊBoth fish dishes were also great, and the sauces were wonderful. We also split the chocolate cake, which came with ice cream. ÊThe cake was delicious, with very dense chocolate; the creme brulee, which had a perfect crispy, crackly crust, and the tapioca pudding. ÊThe pudding was delicious, but seemed a little soup-y compared to other tapiocas I'd had in the past. All in all, great service, great food in a cozy atmosphere. ÊWe'll definitely be back.

Make no butts about it, this place is SMALL. A reservation is for sure needed here. But it is well worth a visit. I ordered the chicken with truffle oil, because, hello? Truffle oil? That shit is like bacon - it makes everything better. The chicken was perfectly cooked: tender, not dry and certainly not raw. My dining companion had the sea bass which was fucking out of this world. We also shared the tuna tartar, which had a little wasabi kick, enough to clear your sinuses but not enough to tear your eyes up. We then split the pumpkin tart (a special that night), and Oh my God.....pumpkins are GODS. Best flavors ever!

This place was definitely a surprise in my mouth. When I stumbled upon the restaurant with my now-ex, I figured it was an americanized asian restaurant. Because...what kind of asian restaurant with cute decor...churns out good foood?? Didn't expect much, but I was wrong. Yes, this place is "asian fusion", but in a good way! The taste of their wasabi noodles with the flat-iron steak leaves you craving for more. The wasabi flavor is not overdone, but enough for you to feel a slight, slight kick. So for you people that hate wasabi, try it because I, too, used to be afraid of wasabi. Also, you must try the sea bass with garlic ginger soy. The sauce is a mixture of sweet, salty, garlic, and chewiness. MMM. The ginger left in the sauce has a texture similar to crystallized ginger candy.

I get it. ÊIt happens. ÊSometimes reservations get lost.

ÊI thought it was odd I did not get a confirmation call about the reservation, so I called them instead. ÊAfter speaking with one woman who couldn't find my name, I was passed on to a different woman who says she couldn't find my name.

I've previously given this place a 2 star purely on their reservation mistakes. I got smarter this time and called them back the morning of the reservations. Finally, I get to taste all the goodness! I did my research on here and shared the sea bass and the flat iron steak. Thank God I didn't stray... as both dishes were as good as everyone else had mentioned! The sea bass was cooked to perfection. As we all know, cooking fish is a very tricky thing. A little too short, and the middle of the fish is still raw... and a little too long, the texture of the fish gets too flaky and tough. This sea bass was just right.... its smooth texture just melts in your mouth. My goodness... they must have timed their cooking time down to the millisecond! How did they do that?! The flat iron steak were just as good.... well seasoned, cooked to a perfect medium rare. Not tough at all. The wasabi noodles? It was good, but I wish I can taste a tad more wasabi. I'm definitely coming back for the food. I'm just going to be alot smarter, and call to confirm my own reservations EVERYTIME.

The atmosphere is unpretentious, maybe even a bit cramped and loud, but the food here is beautifully presented, quickly cooked, and (mostly) very tasty. We had a caprese salad and soft shell crab for appetizers; the former was an interesting take, with peaches and chewy cheese, while the latter was well-crisped, but a bit overwrought in its presentation (breadsticks coming out of the crab's appendages kind of wigged me out, TBH). For the entree, I had the grilled ahi and the Boy had the domestic kobe beef steak; mine entree was fine (I'm glad to say the ahi was sliced well and cooked rare) while his entree was fantastic. Fantastic. I wanted to eat his steak again and again (that's what she said?). But, seriously, I didn't even realize that we had domestic kobe cows here, but whatever we're doing, I recommend we keep on doing. The steak was 1/2 the cost of an imported kobe beef steak and it was equally tasty. Dessert was also memorable -- coconut creme brulee with a tart, bright passionfruit puree --- and I'm looking back to coming back. The only downside was that the wine list was a bit uninspired, with few reds and mostly sparkling and sweet whites, which I guess complement asian fusion? Anyway, TL;DR -- good food for medium-high prices. I recommend giving it a try and bringing some friends, as the dishes are big enough to share and you'll get more variety that way.

As my friend and I were roaming the streets of North Beach looking for a place to eat, we wandered into the HOUSE. ÊShe's eaten there before and loved it, I wanted to give the place a try. ÊIt's a really small restaurant that probably seats about 35 people. We did not make any reservations(as it is best to do so) and the hostess told us that it would be about half an hour wait. ÊShe suggested we take a walk around the neighborhood and asked us to leave our cell phone numbers and would call us when a table is ready. After 45 minutes, no call so we decided to head back to the restaurant, to find that people who arrived after us were already seated. ÊNOT COOL. we asked about our table and she said we were next, but as soon as a table opens, tell me why...some stupid couple swoops in and sits there. It's not even for them...I guess they hadn't realized that we were first in line. PSHH whatever...we were seated shortly after. GOOD THING THEIR FOOD MADE UP FOR THE WAIT, OTHERWISE I WOULD GIVE IT A 2 STAR RATING. We started with the: AHI TUNA TAR TAR: we love tuna tar tar so we ordered it. ÊIt came in three layers each held in place with a piece of nori chip. we each grabbed a chip that was filled with the ahi tuna tar tar. ÊMy friend took a bite and she made a face. UH OH....i took a bite...and then I knew what the face was about. ÊThe both of us are not fond of wasabi and there was a hint of wasabi in it. BOO! I tried to make the most out of it, but she couldn't handle it at all. ÊWe were very dissappointed with our first dish and would have enjoyed it A LOT more if there was no taste of wasabi. SEARED SCALLOPS: it was a special that night. ÊI love scallops so i had to get it!! this dish did not dissappoint at all. the scallops were cooked to perfection and the sweet mustard-like sauce complimented well with it. YUMMY!! GRILLED SEABASS: it came with string beans and garlic noodles. ÊThe fish was also grilled to perfection. ÊI loved the somewhat crispy outside with the buttery soft tender meat in the insides. The meat was really smooth and melted in my mouth. ÊString beans were nice and crunchy, but the garlic noodles was a bit to salty for my liking. MISO BLACK COD: it was a special they had just like the scallops. ÊIt came with chinese brocolli and california rolls. I thought the seabass was good, but this was even better. ÊThe meat was softer and juicier and it melted in my mouth even MORE than the seabass. Chinese brocolli was nice and crunchy and went well with the fish and the sauce. ÊI thought it was weird to have california rolls with it, but it was perfect because the flavors balanced out very well. Overall amazing!! We had this with a glass of wine each=] EACH DISH WAS BEAUTIFULLY PRESENTED and i highly recommend giving this place a try, but remember to make reservations!! it's great for couples, friends and small parties!! Sucks that there's only one bathroom stall!!!

Probably one of my favorite meals so far in San Francisco and the best part is it's only a five minute walk from my apartment...love North Beach. I've heard all the raves in the past and after going there last night I had to add one more. ÊReservations were easy to make the same day and when my friend and I got there we were promptly seated by their friendly staff. ÊAfter noticing the table by the window was empty, my friend and I asked to switch tables, not a problem. We started with the tuna tartar and day boat scallops. ÊThe tartar was heavy on wasabi, but, for a girl who doesn't like wasabi, I still thought it was good. ÊThe scallops were the star of the show, melt in your mouth and wonderfully seasoned and the ponzu dressing was to die for. ÊEverything was beautifully presented with lovely contrasts in color.

Came here on a Fri and parking was horrible..as expected. Thankfully we had reservations and were seated promptly. We ordered the Salmon Roll, Sea Bass, and Swordfish with Coconut Curry. Salmon roll: delicious! tender and rare in the inside and crispy on the outside...just how we like it! Sea Bass: superb! both flavorful and fall off the fork tender Swordfish: It was suppose to be swordfish with coconut curry and clams, but the clams were so small, we had mistaken them for potato bits! Aside from the minuscule clams, the curry and fish were delicious. Looking forward to going back and trying their other dishes! *nom nom*

uhhh..mayyy..singgg!! i definitely recommend trying the ribeye and sea bass. Êi was giddy like a kid in a candy store during my entire meal. the sauces used in each dish were mind blowing. pork chop is a special cut that can be served medium. sea bass melts in your mouth. ribeye has mad umami flava. if you choose to special order the braised pork you must order 3 days in advance. the desserts looked a bit Ê underwhelming. the prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly and attentive. be sure to make a reservation! i love house.

My dad decided to treat the family out for dinner, so he said to make reservations. I called in the early afternoon and snagged a reservation for 4 at 7. We started with the deep-fried salmon roll, which was pretty good. Wasn't the biggest fan of the wasabi sauce though. I had trouble deciding between the grilled ahi tuna and and halibut with coconut curry sauce, but decided to go with the ahi. Presentation was great. Vinagrette on the little salad was sooo goood. My dish came with rice, but I didn't even eat it because I don't really eat rice. They should state on the menu, what exactly comes on the plate. They only list the main item and the sauce. So I had no clue mine would come with rice or the salad. My sister didn't have a clue what would come with her steak, and turns out there was a side of broccolini and mashed potatoes. I would've preferred more veggies than rice. So minus a star for not stating everything that comes on the plate. Everyone seemed to like their dishes, the porkchop with pomegranate sauce, the sea bass (comes with nice green beans and udon noodles), and the ribeye. I just wasn't like OMG when I took my first bite. Lichee black iced tea was pretty good, and bottomless. I liked it better unsweetened. I probably wouldn't order the tuna again, but would like to try something else. Maybe then they can get bumped up a star. Food is solid, but wasn't the best meal of my life.

The House is everything I want in a boyfriend: clean, nice, fun, and not to mention DELICIOUSLY SEXY.... well.. okay... SEXY DELICIOUS! ÊYes. I just described a restaurant as "sexy".

The House is one of my favorite restaurants in the city! Every time I go, I have to order the Salmon Roll appetizer. I've also tried the Sea Bass (amazing), the Pork Chop (juicy and tender), the Ribeye (cooked perfectly), and other delicious specials. I almost always try to order (well me or the boyfriend) one of the daily specials because it's always good. If you have room for dessert, you HAVE to try the Chocolate Cake. I, often, find myself craving that in my sleep. Scary. This place is great for dates, special occasions, birthdays, you name it! But, make reservations because as you can see, it's a popular place! I'd eat at The House every week if I: a) could afford it; b) lived in SF.

We had heard good things about "The House", most of them from fellow-Yelpers. However, we were amazed Êby the inventiveness of the menu and our taste buds were blown away by the flavor and experience of almost everything that we ordered.

This is BY FAR my favorite restaurant in San Francisco!!! ÊShould my daily road rage ever get the best of me, I'll take the death penalty over a life sentence just so I can have my favorite dinner of all time one last time - the Tuna Poke appetizer and the Soy/Ginger glazed Sea Bass. ÊWash it down with one of the inexpensive bottles of wine (or three - if you're gonna go out, you might as well go out drunk!) from the serisously eclectic win list. ÊThe host lactually laughs every time I make reservations wondering what first date I'm bringing in this time. I rarely have anything but the Sea bass, but every once in awhile I have the Pork Chops - the Pomegranite sauce is a perfect Êaccent . ÊI've had the hanger steak as well and it will not disappoing. Ê The long-tenured, pleasant and fun staff is an added bonus. ÊYes, it's small and close to cramped, but who the hell cares when youre having fun and the food is this delicious. P.S.

You go spend money and then forget. ÊThis is not one of those places because it really is that good. ÊI called a day ahead and was surprised that I was able to get an 830 reservation on a Saturday night. Ê Arrived there a little early and had to wait 10 mins past my reservation but I didn't mind. ÊThe place is very small but my gf & I was able to get a nice 4 person table. Ê We started with fried soft shell crab dipped in pepper fish sauce & scallop appetizers.

"the special" curry and halibut with potatoes and veggies DESSERT 6. creme brulee 7. "the special" upside down orange and blueberry cake with vanilla ice cream (the server told us that the owner has only made this TWICE in the 2 years she's worked there) it was SO YUMMY that I want to go back! 8.

With 300 reviews, I don't have to comment about the food. It's always consistently good, and presentation is nothing less than perfect. But I am giving 2 stars for the Poor service. Our waitress was not friendly at all, the only words that came out of her mouth was when she was telling us what the SPECIALS were.(and it didn't sound very special at all). She never said hello, never asked what we wanted to drink, I had to ask for an Iced tea. She didn't bother to check on how the food was after serving it. We had to ask for desserts and the bill from someone else. She never said a word when food was brought to the table. Maybe she was new, or PMSing....but it wasn't the way I intended to celebrate my b-day luncheon. Oh well, at least the food was good. And of course she didn't smile. duh!!!!!!

I've been wanting to eat at The House since I moved to San Francisco based on the raving reviews I've not only read but heard. The restaurant itself is small but that doesn't bother me. As long as it's clean and comfortable and the foods good I can care less of its size. The menu was short and sweet just like how all menus should be. I hate long menus with millions of items, a nice restaurant will always have a short menu with just enough description on each item to make you salivate. I went with 3 other friends and ordered the fried green beans to start off with which was good, anything fried is always good. Although I did enjoy the dipping sauce that came with it- a spicey aoli mixture. We each also got complimentary scallops from the chef and it was pretty divine. The scallop was cooked perfectly with all the perfect spices and sauces complimenting it. My entrŽe was the chicken breast topped with truffle mushrooms. Chicken was cooked the way I liked it- Ênot overcooked, lots of moisture and seasoned well. Truffle is the key to my heart, it should be the the key to human kind's heart. We'd be so fuckin happy if a truffle could lead to world peace. Anyway my plate fell together like a piece of art. I wouldn't have changed a damn thing. I also tried my friend's dishes, a bite of the salmon- delicious sitting on the best broth/sauce. The wasabi noodles was brilliant. The piece of steak I tried was juicy, cooked just right. ÊKeep in mind all these dishes come with sauces and seasoning that you will be not be able to figure out. I kind of wanted to go to the bathroom about 5 times so I can see how they prepared everything haha. Dessert: Creme Brulee- One of the best creme brulee's I've ever had! Perfect creme texture and the caramelized sugar/orange top was such an originally delightful touch. Overall, I love this place like I knew I would. Worth every one of my college pennies.

I had dinner here with some friends a few years ago for my birthday. We made reservations for 7pm for about 7 of us. ÊWe arrived about 5 mins after our reservations and checked in with the hostess...she told us that our table will be ready as soon as possible and that they were really busy that night. (Okkk...) So we agreed and decided to wait outside, because the inside is prettttty small. Ê We waited, and waited and waited for a good 30 mins. It was starting to get a bit irritating because we were all hungry and no one came out to give us an update on why we haven't gotten seated yet. ÊSo of course as soon as we got agitated, they came out and told us our table was finally ready. We sat down and ordered right away. No time wasted! hehe...I got this seafood curry stew that was really good. It was a special they had that night. Everyone chose some really good dishes. But all I can remember was that we were sweating bullets because it was so warm inside with all those people. Overall the beginning was a little annoying, but the food and service made up for it. ÊSo at the end when we left, we were happy. ÊSo I would definitely come back and try it again...especially because it's been awhile.

I saw this place on "Check Please!" and decided to take my g/f there for her birthday. First off, the place is pretty crammed so make reservations unless you want to wait a long time. Service was excellent. Even though it was a Saturday night and pretty packed with large groups, my glass of water was always refilled in a timely manner. The staff seemed to have good timing that goes along with a nice dining experience (bill arriving on time, water refills etc). Onto the food. I went with the flatiron steak with wasabi noodles. There are a ton of reviews for this place so I'm not going to repeat a lot b/c I'm sure it's been said. But I will say that I have had better steaks before but I'm putting everything in context b/c this isn't a steak house. It was good no doubt but the entire plate as a whole was superb. The noodles are tasty and spicy. The presentation and plating of the dish was exceptional. You just have to try it. My g/f went with the sea bass with wasabi noodles. I had a small bite of the fish and it was very good as well. Before I forget. We usually don't get dessert but couldn't pass on the truffle cake topped with coffee ice-cream along with small amount of caramel serving as a base for the dish. We ate that up with ease. One last thing i'll note are the reasonable prices for top notch food. You just don't get that at many places. Two quality dishes with dessert was about 50 bucks. That's hard to beat.

Sunday Night Ive been here on numerous occasions and I usually get the Seabass or Wasabi Noodles, but since there were Êa group of us, we decided to ordered a bunch of dishes off of their special as well as their main menu Ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips - It was good but not my favorite Steamed mussels with garlic infused shrimp broth - SO GOOD! Mussels were perfectly cooked, they werent chewy at all! Deep-fried chicken liver with baby greens - i liked everything but the chicken liver? LOL it's an acquiring taste.. and i couldnt!

The food is amazing. Simple and fresh Asian fusion. I've been in for lunch and for dinner, and I think the lunch menu wins purely based on the curry noodles with grilled chicken and vegetables, one of my favorite dishes anywhere. Also a hit is the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. The restuarant is small so call ahead for a reservation if you can. On weekend nights it fills up fast and stays full, making walk-ins, especially with more than two people, pretty difficult. The food is worth the trip.

The name is appropriate, as I would honestly live here (for lunch and dinner at least). Fried Salmon Rolls to start, were ridiculously good. They come with some soy sauce already saturated with wasabi which was surprising at first when i generously dipped in the roll. I chose one of the many specials (all sounded great), the hamachi sashimi which I was told arrived fresh today. It literally melted in my mouth. On the side were some mala string beans which tasted just like my parents used to make. Spicy, garlicy and good. Can't wait to come back to try the rest of the menu... Update: the unagi sandwich was just as I expected, perfect in every way. Also had the nigiri special of the day and the hamachi was great...

Wow-- now I know what "5 stars" on yelp means. I regret how loosey goosey I've been with the star scale here... because this place definitely deserves more than 5 stars. I suggested we take our in-laws here upon their arrival to SF (from Detroit)... and lets just say that every person at the table was blown away. I never tried Asian Fusion-- and I'll be honest, I didn't think it would be good, but The House has got the right formula. The flavors were complex, but not weird. Presentation was great too! And the service was the best I've had in San Francisco. I'm definitely bringing any and all family members here when they come to visit, since I've never run across a restaurant like this in any other city I've lived in. Every cut of fish, breast of chicken, or seafood was fresh, well prepared and tenderly cooked. I couldn't have asked for better food-- really. They have deserts too-- and they're also great. However, my 5 stars are really for the entrees and service. Thanks Yelpers for helping me find this place!!!

Add me to the list of Yelpers who place The House in their top-5 list of Bay Area restaurants. ÊThis place is about the only thing that could incent me to deal with the stand-still traffic, impossible parking, and general madness that is North Beach on a Saturday night. The focus of this restaurant is very much on the food itself. ÊFor a restaurant of this caliber in this area, the service and decor are undistinguished, and the vibe is (thankfully) unpretentious. ÊAlso, while this certainly isn't a bargain bite, the prices aren't unreasonable being more-than-justified by the quality of the food. I've tried many (if not most) items on the menu, and I'd have a hard time recommending just one, though the miso-basted grilled sea bass referred to by others here is consistently excellent (though not consistently available). It's really hard to write about this place without salivating. ÊI think I'll call now for a reservation for this weekend...

Good food, stylish and out of the world presentation, good service, haute Asian fusion cuisine - all for a very reasonable price (at least for lunch). I would definitely bring friends here to San Francisco if I wanted to impress them with how haute Asian cuisine can be on the west coast without making my credit card company going bankrupt. Food eaten out of home should be about stuff that is tough to replicate inside the house - and The House has brought out memorable looking dishes. However, the least memorable dish I've had of four dishes so far was the steak.

The House is one of those restaurants where I am okay with their small menu. Ê It highlights what they specialize in. ÊSo you don't have to spend time flipping through pages to decide what you want, but rather, just go with the one you always order. ÊBecause sometimes, changes are just unnecessary. For lunch, a group of us used to cab all the way from downtown to North Beach just to get the wasabi noodles. ÊAnd lychee iced tea. ÊNo one ever thought about branching out and order something different. Ê For dinner, I absolutely love the grilled sea bass. ÊIt's so delicious that after you inhale the whole thing, it just makes you hungry for more sea bass. Ê So here is my only complaint: when you get an entree, that's really all you get. ÊWhat happened to the nice American tradition of mandatory sides and endless bread for your entree to fill you up? ÊI mean, as delicious as they are, social decency tells me I would be labeled as "crazy" for ordering TWO sea bass for dinner.

Yum! What a treat. Not too familiar with dining in North Beach, I was taken here by a friend for an early lunch and was very pleasantly surprised. It's a small space so if you're not looking for it you just might walk right past it. Perusing the menu I wasn't completely sold on their selection of veggie items- i think they list 1 veggie entree and maybe 1 veggie appetizer? But after being convinced that I had to try their Warm wasabi house noodles (hand pulled!) I asked if their was any chance I could get them served vegetarian style. I was delighted to have a wonderfully accommodating waitress who acted like it was a no big deal request and asked if tofu & veggies would be fine- of course! Delicious. I gulped up every last warm comforting bite in under ten minutes. Also must mention that we started with the blue lake bean tempura - another item that can be easily overlooked and should not be missed! Finally we ended our lunch with a dense chocolate cake w/espresso ice cream, caramel & coconut sauce if I remember correctly? I was in complete bliss during this course so you'll have to excuse me if I didn't get the ingredients down just right... All in all, I will definitely be back. Service was an A+, food was an A+, menu creativity was also an A+ and the price was just right as well. All entrees seemed to be around $10. The total bill for two of us with a shared starter, 2 entrees, drinks & a shared dessert was just over $50. Not bad for a gourmet North Beach lunchtime dining experience!

A couple of different friends had recommended it to me, and I think I went there with expectations that were a little too high. ÊAs a result, I was underwhelmed by House. Don't get me wrong. The food was definitely delicious, and the portions more than generous. However, I did not find the Sole or the Noodles that we ordered particularly memorable. ÊThe restaurant itself seemed very very crowded to me - with barely any standing room to wait for a table. ÊThe service was just average. I did enjoy the dessert though. ÊThe warm apple pie was very well made and more than enough for two to share. This is one of the better restaurants in North Beach. ÊBut with so many other choices in SF, I am not dying to return anytime soon.

Everyone I know that has been here raves about the place! ÊSo we had to try it. Yes we were that pair, Êthe ones that come in at 2:20pm for lunch when you stop serving at 2:30pm. ÊIf I were them, I would have shown my butt to the door, but no, they sat us with a smile and never once gave us that bitter look that I myself felt for us. Ê My friend and I had the mussels, short ribs, shrimp dumplings, and the sea bass. ÊAll were great. ÊYummy. ÊMore than great! ÊThe short ribs were my personal favorite, but I think my friend, well he loved the sea bass. ÊI had a sparkling rose, and he had a beer, both were perfect compliments to what we were eating. Ê So when I came here, I was craving some pad Thai.......of course it wasn't that kind of place. ÊIt was more fusion than Thai, but given the location in North Beach it made sense. ÊReally tiny place, simple decor and presentation, though both were nice. Ê Of course when people rave and rave about a place you get let down. ÊWhile I was let down, that was only because everyone had raved so much. ÊHad I just came in without any pre-conceived expectations I would have been perfectly happy. ÊOh well.

A friend that recommended Fuzio's recommended the House. ÊThis saved his reputation. ÊI had a fantastic butter lettuce and gorgonzola salad. ÊI then had a "kobe" beef special with hosin barbecue sauce. ÊIt was stunning. ÊServed with angel hair frites. ÊI would have preferred to be on a date here; they were hard-pressed to accommodate a party of 12, and I did not envy anyone else that night as we were pretty raucous. We also drank them out of 2 kinds of beer. ÊThe service was excellent.

The House was one of our restaurants to try this past week in SF. We made reservations and got there around 8:30 pm on Thursday only to find that the place is completely packed with people, and several groups waiting to be seated. After standing around for about 10 minutes we were seated by the host who was super friendly and came up to us to explain the seating situation. The restaurant is pretty tiny but we got a table at the end of a hall so it was actually pretty secluded. The food itself was good. I can't say that its the best thing I've ever had but it was definitely good. We got the ahi tuna and a steak and both turned out very well. The meats were tender and flavorful. My plate w/ tuna was really well put together. What really did it for me was the service that we got from the host and our waitress. Both were extremely friendly and welcoming. Our waitress made a couple of recommendations and described the dishes pretty well. I spent a week in SF and this is the one restaurant that I would recommend to everyone.

Went here for a friends birthday. We were in a group of 11 so I was able to taste a little of almost everything on the dinner menu. For myself I ordered the Rib-eye steak. I've never had Rib-eye with Teriyaki Sauce before. I loved it. Another great main dish was the Pork Chop with the Pomegranate sauce. Yummie. Small restaurant for our large party. I felt bad for the couple sitting next to our loud asses. I give it 4 stars because I thought the location was ghetto. There were crazy bums on the street but then again I'm originally from San Diego so I guess I'm not used to the streets of SF yet. My bad, I don't encounter poor people much.

This is a tiny little place in an odd little space, but it's got a cute look and an inspired asian california fusion. There are so many places to choose from in this wonderful city that it's hard to eat in any place more than once but this is one of those places that you can always come and try new things. We have less of these fusion type restaurants where I live in Pasadena and far more traditional and authentic places, so this is a Ênice change of pace. Try the Chilean Sea Bass, it's pretty amazing.

Wow. I saw the 4.5 star average over hundreds of review, and I thought I couldn't go wrong, and it was spot on... totally awesome... in fact, out of this world awesome. The location at first seemed a bit of a dive, but the interior is clean though a bit cramped. We started with the calamari, which is the best seasoned I've had in recent memory. For the entrees, we family styled the steak, the salmon, the tuna, and the shrimp, Whoa... whoa... whoa... WHOA. Each were perfectly seasoned, balanced... just all around good... including the gorgeous presentation. Service was good, but I was a bit underwhelmed. But the food more than makes up for everything else lacking... it's one of my new favorites... wish I lived closer.

This place missed the mark for me, but only in regards to a few things. ÊI used to sling around my 5-stars, but I've started holding out as I have tried to provide more accurate ratings based off of Yelp's standards. After watching a play with my friend, we called The House and made a reservation. ÊSomehow we were able to make reservations in the next 15 minutes, so I was happy. ÊWe found parking a couple blocks away, thankfully, and made our way to the restaurant. ÊThey don't really have a waiting area, other than a small area by the door or outside. Ê We didn't have to wait too long after our previously informed time, and were seated rather quickly. ÊI was highly intrigued by the type of food, but I quickly realized that "fusion" was a loosely used term. ÊFor instance, the first place they stumbled was with the starter they provided to us. ÊIt essentially was a standard Chinese appetizer, yet it was made extremely poorly. ÊIt really isn't that hard to soak cucumber in soy, sesame seeds, and vinegar. ÊIt seemed as if they had just whipped it together without letting the flavors soak into the cucumber and soften it up. ÊFor me, this was the first stumble. ÊIf you're going to have "fusion" food, then fuse it. ÊDon't just make a mediocre version of an authentic dish. The oysters we ordered were amazing--absolutely amazing. ÊThey brought out six, and after having my second one I was happy. ÊThen my third one floored me. ÊIt literally took my mood and slammed it on the floor and said, "HA! ÊYou thought this was good, but we fooled you." ÊMy last one tasted like it was just fished out of the river. ÊIf I wanted river-flavored food, I would go to the river and get it myself. ÊThe House, you were extremely close, but you missed that mark here. The second appetizer we had was the unagi. It was basically a standard version of unagi you order at a sushi restaurant. ÊIt was nothing special, and nothing truly shined about it. ÊThe rice I make at home is better than what they used, but it's a moot point. On to the entrŽes... The wasabi noodles with steak was actually tasty, but it was missing a vital ingredient, spice. ÊI flagged down the server and requested more of the sauce that came with our oysters. ÊOnce she brought it out, I dumped the entire ramiken of sauce into my noodles and it just opened up my palate. ÊThe entire dish seemed to sing after that. ÊIf the dish had come out like this, then I would have overlooked the oyster and mediocre starter in order to give them 5 stars. Ê All-in-all, this is a great place to come with a date. ÊIt's quaint, homey, and has a great atmosphere. ÊI would certainly come back, but they need to step up their game a little bit in order for that elusive fifth star from me. As a side note, my friend had one of the ahi tuna dishes. ÊWhat I tried of his was mediocre at best. ÊIt was missing something vital as well, but it was my dish to correct. ÊHe was extremely happy with it, but then again he'll eat anything. ÊAnyways, it just factors into my point I mentioned earlier of finding the missing elements of the dishes and this place will be absolutely amazing.

This was my first real introduction to Asian Fusion... and it has led to a very expensive hobby! ÊParking is horrendous in North Beach but that is the one and only down fall.

I came to The House for dinner with a friend when I visited SF recently. ÊConsidering we were here on a friday evening, the wait for a table was not that bad...15 minutes. ÊOnce seated, the server came over right away ready to take our orders. ÊWe started off with the calamari appetizer and a bottle of sake. ÊThe calamari was cooked just right (slightly underdone). ÊFor my entree, I ordered the Grilled Sea Bass based on all the Yelp reviews I read and it was a great choice. ÊIt was cooked to perfection and was quite tasty. I loved the beans that came on the side as well as the noodles. ÊMy friend had his regular, the Wasabi Noodles with Grilled Sirloin. ÊI had a bite of the Grilled Sirloin and it was good too. ÊOur sake was a good choice. ÊIt was light and went well with our meals. Ê We decided to order dessert to end our great meal. ÊWe shared the Passionfruit creme brulee and it was yummy. ÊI really liked passionfruit sauce. Ê Service here was efficient and the food was served quicker that I would think considering the crowd on a Friday night. ÊThe only negative about this place is the space itself. Ê It is very small and cramped. ÊAnd, the noise level is high. ÊBut I've found very few restaurants in the Bay Area that are not small, cramped and loud.

Had a good meal here but not as good as I was expecting from all the reviews and my friends hyping this place up. *Ahi tuna tartare (B-): i've had way better, and way more creative, and the fish didn't taste super fresh (plus there was wasabi...which does not agree with me) *Tempura blue lake beans (B+): solid performance, but it's just tempura beans (i actually think the ones at Yuzu are better) *Sea bass w/ garlic noodles and long beans: YUM-O! i really loved this dish. Êi'm so sad that i drank too much root beer during apps so that i was too full to really enjoy my entree. Êthe fish was tender/flaky/juicy, and the garlic noodles were awesome and had cloud ear's in it!! *mushroom risotto w/ grilled prawns (A+): loved this asian take on mushroom risotto. Êsuper rich and complex! *apple crumb pie w/ vanilla (A): bf ate it all up w/o talking *red velvet cake w/ cream cheese frosting (B+): good flavor, but the cake was dry...boo Service is super nice and it's a nice place for a date.

I have been coming to the house on the regular for over a year, and it is consistently an absolutely delicious dining experience. I have experienced a lot of restaurants in the city and this is by far hands down one of the best. It never fails to deliver and always goes beyond and above expectations. I had the special last night which was black cod with some kind of soy and wasabi sauce below, it was cooked to perfection, you can also never go wrong by having the sea bass which is a regular item on their menu. the staff is very good I'm always made to feel like a part of of their extended family, the service is amazing. When I go I always stick to the seafood because every time i have had it it's always done perfectly, the house made noodles are awesome as well. I did try the flat iron steak and really thought it was just OK, i would never order the flat iron steak because it's not really a cut I enjoy easting. All in all one of the finer dining establishments in the city and they've definitely earned repeat business from me and my family and I thoroughly recommend them to anyone wanting a truly unique SF dining experience.

I came here today with two of my girl buddies. We had reservations for 3 at 1pm. My friend led the way. The place is pretty small but they can probably have a total of 25 customers. There was no line during the entire 1.5 hours we were there. Easy to find seats. It was pretty comfy and the atmosphere was nice. The only problem is that the tables were really close to one another. You didn't even have to try to hear the conversation the people sitting next to you are having. They have a lot of fish items. I don't really like fish so that limited my options. I ordered the udon with chicken. I thought it was okay. I felt like I could have made it and the soup is pretty oily. My friend ordered the wasabi noodles. I tried some and it was good. You can order it so it is not spicy. I would probably get that if I come again. The main waitress looks very bohemian. Another waitress looked pissed off. Only one of the waitress looked happy. Probably make the whole dining experience better if the people who worked there looked more enthusiastic. We ordered the chocolate cake for dessert with ice cream on top. We shared among the three of us. It was plenty even though it looked small. The chocolate was too rich but the ice cream was good although they don't give you much.

Likes: the house wasabi noodles with tuna. I thought it was absolutely delicious! The salmon was cooked beautifully and the wasabi gave the noodles an extra kick in the flavor. Service was fast and good too! Dislikes: Waiting for seats. You can't really wait inside so we had to wait outside in the cold wind. But it's well worth the wait. It's also a bit on the pricey side. But the food was worth it and this is a place I'd definitely go back to.

I LOVE THE HOUSE! The place is small, but super cozy and friendly. The staff is extremely attentive, but my one lone compliant is that the waitress who read the special said it so monotonously that it didn't even sound appealing after she was done. Had the steamed mussels appetizer-- great, not amazing. The broth was interesting but was it worth $9? Not so sure. The sea bass and steak were both amazing; perfectly cooked and full of intense flavor. The sides for both-- mashed potatoes, noodles, asparagus-- were delicious. It's a little pricey, but so, so worth it. Trust me! It's definitely one of the hidden gems in the area, and I can't wait to come back again!

I finally had dinner at the legendary House. Actually, not too legendary as I had only heard about it once from a friend at the gym. A friend we were with had been here many times, so we appointed her as our menu advisor. Black cod and sea bass highly recommended. Overall, everything was delicious and tasty, but not orgasmically must-return-the-next-evening good. Six of us shared the following: 2x miso black cod, 2x grilled sea bass, prawns w/ risotto, and wasabi noodles w/ steak. Miso black cod - Solid, but not as good flavorful as Nobu. Still my favorite of the evening though. It was one of the specials and I would order it if they had it again. A fairly generous portion served with California roll (weird) and some veggies. Grilled sea bass - I'm such a sucker for sea bass, so of course I loved this. I also love green beans. A good fall back if they don't have black cod. Served with noodles that looked just like the wasabi noodles, but without the wasabi. lol! Prawns w/ risotto - The prawns were huge, cooked to perfection, and had great seasoning. Risotto was just ok, seems like something I might be able to whip up at home from an online recipe. Wasabi noodles w/ steak - Not bad, but pretty basic imo. Stir fried noodles with a kick of wasabi, topped with some sliced steak. Soft-shell crab tempura - Good appetizer, although I forgot to try the dipping sauce. A bit hard to share. :P I was curious about the pork w/ pomegranate sauce as I love this combination, but a friend said it was kinda dry the last time she ordered it. The restaurant is really small, and fortunately we had a reservation. As mentioned in many of the other reviews, the tables *are* very close together, so perhaps not the most private atmosphere. Service was good and prompt. Parking is ridiculous in this area, so come early and be prepared to walk a bit. It was decent value, but I'm not sure I'd come back without the black cod. Maybe to try the pomegranate pork.

Finally tried this place for Mom's birthday this week, and what a treat! We ordered two small plates and one entree, there isn't much difference in price but there were many yummy small plates to choose from, so we went with that. We ordered: salmon rolls: Nice big portions of salmon, really light taste (even though it's deep fried) and a great hot mustard sauce. The salmon roe on top made it divine. Steamed mussels: This one was ok for me, a little on the salty side but thats what mom really liked about it. You get about a dozen mussels and a lot of sauce, no bread though-would have been nice to dip. Pork sandwich: Really tender, really salty (in a really good way) and sweet at the same time. The bread is perfectly toasted and it's a nice big portion of meat, love the sauce. ÊIt also comes with a lovely, fresh vinaigrette salad. The restaurant is quite small so it wouldn't be good for crowds or big families, but i like intimate/small settings so it's a good thing in my book. There were a lot of dishes I wanted to try, especially in the entrees (a lady next to us got a flat iron steak with potatoes and French green beans and it looked gorgeous!) Located blocks from work and under $30 before gratuity means I'll be back soon for lunch! Recommend to anyone, especially those who like a great fusions of Asian/Californian style food.

First restaurant stop in sf, and it was a geat idea! A friend's brother recommended the place, so I was super excited to try it out. We got the tuna tartar to start off with and it was good, but nothing special. I had the seabass with wasabi noodles. Make sure to request the wasabi noodles since the dish comes with house noodles. If you like wasabi, you'll like the noodles. The noodles were similar to chow mein, but had the taste of wasabi. Yum! We also ordered the pork chops and it was excellent! Tender, flavorful, and delicious! Def a place to comeback to on my next trip up to sf! The food comes out fast, and our server was super attentive.

Ê Must admit I'm not a fan of fusion places.. ÊTherefore garlic noodles to me = shanghai noodles missing all the meat and veggies. Nothing too impressive. Ê All of my friends love this place and I'd come back if invited, but there's really nothing too special on the menu.

I'm a little disappointed. Their whole thing is serving their own version of Asian fusion, using sustainable and local ingredients. So why are they using farmed salmon and tomatoes from Mexico? (at least I'm assuming that's where they're from, they sure are not growing here in California). I was a little disappointed when I ordered my BLT and then remembered that it's the middle of winter, and bit into a limp tomato. Tuna BLT was overall pretty good though. The picked things they serve to you at the beginning are also delicious. I also enjoyed the contrast of the tart passionfruit puree with the very sweet coconut creme brulee. I went in at 2:25 at a Tuesday, so there was no wait, unlike many other times I've walked by it. But would I go out of my way for this place? Absolutely not.

The food was amazing. I had the pork chops and it was soft, tender, but not chewy. The appetizer (I forgot what it was, but something with chips and wasabi) wasn't as appealing as I thought it would be, but perhaps it was due to my distaste for wasabi. I HIGHLY suggest making a reservation as it can get busy in that tiny space.

I'll keep this very brief. Our apps were: salmon rolls, the scallops and clams in a spicy-ish broth (I believe this was a special). Not a speck left on any of the dishes. Only complaint was that extra toasted bread wasn't given to sop up the remaining broth. :) I had the special of butterfish topped with long slices of California roll. The entire dish was flat-out awesome. Dessert: coconut creme brulee with a passionfruit sauce (perfect thing to end with as it's refreshing and just slides right down) and a chocolate cake with coffee ice cream and caramel sauce (this one wasn't my choice - I thought it would be way too heavy to end with - but it proved to be good enough for me to keep digging my fork into for more!). Everything arrived soooo fast. Good for the hungry peeps at the table. The service was sooo sweet that it totally erased the feeling that we may have been rushed to get through dinner. At the end of the day, it's a teeny restaurant and there are tons of bars to go to afterwards to linger.

After my first visit, this place easily became one of my faves in SF. I came here with a larger party and managed to taste everyone's food (sea bass, ribeye, flatiron steak, salmon rolls, ahi tuna) and EVERYTHING was Êtantalizing to the taste buds. The juicy/buttery ribeye may just be my favorite. I was ecstatic to find Chimay on their drink list. A great beer to help me wash down my dinner. If you're into foo foo cocktails, you won't find them here - beer & wine only. Though the restaurant is small in size, we were still able to make reservations for a party of 12. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food they have available. All entrees are $17-24. The only negative comment I have to make about this place was the service. Our server was so strange. I told her we were ready to order and because 2 people at the end of our table were still debating, she wouldn't begin. We told her to go ahead and start from the other end and she refused because she always starts Êfrom one specific side! WTF. I don't understand why she couldn't just come back around. Anyway, luckily the food was amazing.

I was a bit skeptical since this Asian Fusion restaurant is located in North Beach...although I'm not familiar with the area, isn't North Beach Italian?

It was good, but not exceptional like I expected. Bf and I came here on a Saturday night. Bad idea- parking was horrible. We looped around the streets 3x before we paid $15 for parking in a private lot. We made reservations so we didn't wait long. The place was small, crowded. I had to squeeze into my chair because the tables were so close...and it was kind of uncomfortable eating right next to someone I didn't know. We ordered the roasted unagi (eel) with avocado sushi rice as an appetizer. It was good, but not beyond anything I've tasted at other sushi restaurants. Our waitress recommended it to us. Not bad, though. He ordered the sea bass, and it was exceptional! Cooked to perfection. We both loved it. I had the grilled ahi tuna (rare) with spicy mustard aioli, which was alright to say the least. The meat was good- tender and had lots of taste. It came with rice and spinach which was really eh; probably something I could have made at home. We had a good experience because the service was really on top of things! Our waters were always filled, which is a sign that I know they're always checking up on us. Overall, pretty decent food and some pretty bad parking = 3 stars.

Order the sea bass! It's the most tender, melt-in-your-mouth fish I've ever tried. Already infused with a healthy dose of garlic, it comes with a sweet black garlic-soy sauce that tastes superb with just about any other fish or meat on the table. I ordered the salmon, which was decent but pretty bland compared to the sea bass. Thankfully, my friend let me have her leftover black sauce once she finished her fish. I also thoroughly enjoyed the unagi with avocado sushi rice appetizer - the crunchiness of the roasted eel and the creaminess of the avocado was a winning combination of textures.

I came here for a friends birthday, super excited to try this 4star restaurant rated by yelp. Ê The restaurant is located in the beginning of the broadway strip and parking can be a bit difficult. ÊIf you have reservations for a big group, come at least 30mins early! The restaurant is a bit tiny and seems like a high end *hole in the wall restaurant*,.. the food here is really original and nothing from dinner kept me wanting more or kept me from wanting to come back to dine. Our whole group left to party on broadway and half way through our night,. ALL OF US HAD A BAD STOMACH ACHE and felt sick. ÊNot only was it just our group,. a few friends of mine had previously dined at the HOUSE and also had a stomach ache, I won't be back,..

Tasty tasty! I need to come back with a bigger appetite because I had just eaten breakfast 2 hours before I came here so I only managed bites of the deep fried salmon roll and the deep fried halibut and fries (one of the specials of that day). The deep fried salmon roll was amazing, the menu description does not do it justice. I thought it was going to be a salmon sushi roll- but it's a good chunk of salmon, wrapped in seaweed (I think?) and fried. It's served with a really good slaw with some kimchi spices and a hot mustard sauce- really really good! The inside of the salmon is raw-ish, just super super tasty. The fried halibut was pretty good too, but not as amazing as the salmon. We managed to find parking pretty easily and there were a lot of fun stores to wander around while waiting for our reservation (12pm). They seated us at 11:45 since we were so early, but no one else came in until around 12:45pm and then it filled in quickly.

Came back again to treat my sister to a birthday dinner. I've been abroad so it's been a while since I came last! When we came in (5:30pm) it was sort of awkward; no one was there and the ... I don't know, hostess? was conversing with some lady at another table. ÊAfter that lady left, they left the plates and cutlery there.. for some reason, I felt like.. if you're sitting at a table over plates, well first of all, you shouldn't do that anyway.. whatever We shared the fried salmon roll; for some reason the salmon felt bland, but gotta love the intense rush of its wasabi-infused sauce! Our waitress unfortunately had a very heavy accent and it was difficult to understand what the specials were.. (since they have so many anyway). I DID manage to hear black cod - and I've been wanting to try that. Loved the sauce, the flakiness flavorful fish, the lovely california rolls, and the mini bok choys(?).. or was it chinese broccoli, not sure. Sister got the pork chops.. delicious sauce, delicious huge meat; .. not too big of a fan of the mashed potato thing but my sis liked it (lathered in the sauce). We shared the bittersweet chocolate truffle cake...... Êlarge, rich, DELICIOUs. Êeasily a great way to end the meal. For 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 dessert + tax/tip = $80. So for those who are financially strapped (i'm unemployed at the moment), maybe it's a safer bet to come here for lunch, or to suggest it to someone who's planning on treating you. Ê;-P DELICIOUS.

Amazing fish dishes, great atmosphere and great jasmine pearl tea. we had: Ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips - Amazing and my first time trying raw fish! Softcrab shell appertizer (special) - very good ! Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak - this was the mediocre dish from the group.

The House never disappoints... And if your dish is a little disappointing, your company's dish will at least make up for it. Everyone is right. The seabass is bomb and totally melts in your mouth. Also good were the wasabi noodles, pork chops, and salmon rolls. The presentation of each dish is superb, almost like eating a work of art (that is mind-blowingly delicious). I've never met anyone who didn't like this place. All the people I ask who have eaten here, their reaction is always the same: THEY LOVE IT. The place is really small but the 4 times I've been here, I've never had to wait. I could've been lucky so make a reservation if you can. Lunch menu is cheaper, dinner is almost double. Parking can be hard to find.

I think their popularity has gotten to their head because the last time I came here with a group of 8, we were told prior to being seated that we had to be done and out in an hour!? WTF?! I understand it's a super small place we were partially to blame because we were 15 minutes late for our reservation but we did call to notify them that we were running late. Our server was brusque and short with us the entire meal which added to our annoyance and so the meal just went downhill from there. The food has never let me down at The House but it's not irreplaceable as a especially given the plethora of other great restaurant options in SF. Unfortunately, although the food was good, it's not great, and doesn't make up for the poor service we received which doesn't make it worthy of a return visit.

When I first came here, I was like, "Holy Jebus, we're never going to be seated." We had reservations and still had to wait a good 25 mins. for a table, which defeats the purpose of having a reservation in the first place. Feel bad for those who just did a walk-in. That con aside, food is good. I tried the tuna tartar, flat iron steak, and the sea bass. The flavor the chef is able to muster out of these dishes justifies the price. Not a bad spot for a quick meal IF you don't mind the wait.

I'm pretty sure I can't say a darned thing that hasnt been already but I it gotta speak on it. ÊThere's some good things goin on at the house. ÊSome people might call "fusion" cuisine a gimmick but I say hey, as long as it tastes delicious, I'm all aboard! You may not be blown away by the creativity of a pear shaped crab cake or salmon egg rolls, and many of the flavors may be familiar. ÊHowever all these flavors come together seamlessly in the way that makes this type of food such a joy. Ê The salmon rolls and tempura green beans are great for sharing appetizers if you like a tasty fried treat before your entree. ÊI had the halibut in a thai curry broth wich was really nice (but then again halibut is my favorite fish in the whole wide world), my only wish that there were more vegetables in the broth. Ê Really tasty asian flavors combined with great quality seafood and meats is a combination that I won't soon grow tired of. .

i have to say i am quite disappointed. we waited for this place for almost 2 hours and i was expecting very good dishes. we ordered the following: - salmon roll appetizer: i really like this roll because it was salmon wrapped in a crispy layer of spring roll. very interesting texture. - wasabi house noodles with steak: it wasn't too impressive because it was just regular thick noodle with some wasabi flavor and steak.. - sea bass: this is what they highly recommended. i mean it's cooked really well, but i didn't feel that it was any special. overall, i feel that the same type of dish could be ordered from a chinese restaurant that would cost much less and you don't have to wait around in the crammed corner.

After living in California for so long, you would expect I would be used to the concept of Asian fusion but it continues to confuse me. In fact, I can get a little weary about any type of Asian food served in an environment a little too nice - I crave the hole in the wall where you have to wipe the top of your soda to ensure safety. I went against my better judgment when a few friends were in town on business and they agreed to expense my meal providing I would agree to come to The House. Needles to say, this place absolutely blew me away. The food was absolutely amazing. It was the perfect experience from the start - everything on the menu sounds so mouthwatering you narrow it down to your top 5, discuss with your counterparts, figure out a way to have a taste of absolutely everything and feel set....until the waitress comes around with the specials and you plan is splattered. After a LOT of debate and contemplation, I ordered a black cod special and as the dishes came around to the table I realized everything on the menu really is amazing and anything ordered would not have disappointed. The appetizers were the perfect size - a flavorful teaser of more to come. And my mango desert was the perfect night topper. The ambiance was priceless. The whole environment made me feel like someone pictured through a window enjoying wine and conversation among good company with a huge smile on my face and a feeling that life can be just amazing. What more can a girl ask for? I have a new appreciation for Asian fusion and will likely be back.

About 12 of us came here for dinner in this cozy place for our annual holiday dinner. ÊWell, actually 5 of us. ÊThe other 7 showed up an hour late, including the one that made the reservation. ÊThat being said, the staff waited patiently, and waited about 45 minutes before they politely let us know they would have to give up the seats if no one else showed up soon. ÊLuckily, they did, and given how late they were, at no point did we feel rushed. In any case, while we were waiting, we ordered a couple of bottles of wine and some apps. ÊThe presentation of the apps was beautiful, and tasted as good as they looked. ÊAs for my entree, I was torn between two things, but my friend convinced me to get the mushroom rice. ÊTruth be told, it sounded like something I could have made, and would have preferred the other option (which I can't remember anymore). ÊWell it's a good thing I listened to my friend. It was ah-MAAAAAAY-zing. ÊI don't know what they did to it, but it sure was good. Ê Of course, dessert always comes after dinner and we split a number of things from the menu.

Keeping with SF's ever present Ê"pan asian" restaurant culture, food here fits the bill to a T. This place never lets me down! The food is amazing with the wasabi noodles topping the chart.

Yum! Every visit has been great. Generally without a reservation, we can still get a table after a brief wait. This time around we got the Unagi and avocado rice, steak and noodle, and tuna tartar. The Unagi had some kind of vein or sinew running down the length of it so it made for difficult cutting but the overall dish was flavorful... if you don't like the hint of fatty taste, don't get this. The tuna tartar was very yummie... i was hoping for some chili oil on it but for what it was it was very good. the steak and noodle dish was rich and filling and worked well to split.

This place is a hole in the wall but we had to make reservations because it gets filled up.My bf took me here for my birthday and the food was fantastic.

I'm always a little hesitant when my friends ask me out to eat at an Asian Fusion place, but the experience I had at The House was great. ÊIt's a small venue, so definitely make reservations as early as you can, especially if you have a big group coming. ÊThey are willing to accommodate as best as they can, and when I kept switching up the number of people arriving they were still very nice about it. For the appetizer we ordered salmon rolls, which were flavored very well and had a nice crackling, crispy outer layer. ÊI got to taste the sea bass, which was tender and juicy, and I also enjoyed my flank steak that sat atop a mound of wasabi noodles. ÊIf they end up reading this review at all (which I doubt) I hope that they tone down the spiciness a bit. Ê All of the waitstaff were incredibly nice, and be prepared for the waiter or waitress to recount a list of specials that aren't on the menu. ÊIt's definitely not a cheap eats sort of place, but it is a great place for a special get-together or a first date that is sure to impress. Ê I definitely recommend a visit, and I will probably journey back there again soon!

When you come here with PF Chang or Panda Express expectation, a 4+ star is likely. However after reading all the reviews here about this amazing fusion restaurant, my friends and I came with Nobu/Roy's/Thanh Long expectation re: the sea bass dish and dessert. As a result, the sea bass dish that everyone was supposed to love becomes what we love to hate. The sea bass was cooked well but was pretty dull in the flavoring department. Garlic soy noodle accompanying the sea bass was a total train wreck since you barely taste the garlic or any seasoning. If you want to make statement with garlic, do it ala garlic noodle at Thanh Long. Grade: C+ On the other hand, the pork chop with pomegranate sauce is super delicious. I can't stop stealing my friend's pork chop and force-fed him with my sea bass. Grade: B+ Coconut creme brulee was unforgettable - not because of the amazing sugar crust but more because of the unforgivable passionfruit sauce that totally masks the taste of the brulee. Grade: C+ Chocolate truffle cake with espresso ice cream is a good way to end the dish. Rich and not too sweet. I can live without the (from Costco?) espresso ice cream. Grade: B+ In a nutshell, The House is indeed a step up from PF Chang but not by much. Oh, the server is super polite but they will try to rush you out asap by serving the food as fast as Panda Express.

If you're looking to very quietly whisper sweet nothings into your lover's ear amidst a large dimly lit dining room then this joint isn't going to cut it. However, if you're on a quest for deliciously well-prepared food served up in a small-space, energetic, people-packed environment...hunt down this place. Sure it's loud. Sure you walk in and wait in this tiny corner while they prep a table (near a crazy-ass door that has a hydraulic mind of its own). ÊAnd sure, it's tightly packed. But in this case, the juice is worth the squeeze (literally.) So once you've checked out their high-tech and well-designed website (http://www.thehse.com) you might actually be skeptical. However you see the photos, read the menu and put your Asian-Fusion Yummy Cap on - and the salivation begins. Try this navigation on for size: - 1 part deep fried salmon roll app (dont' be shy with the hot mustard) - 1 part Asian sweet and crispy ribs app (if they have 'em on the specials. And go ahead and steal the hot mustard from the salmon roll for these too! haha. Go hot mustard!) - Either the Kobe Beef w/ pomegranate reduction or the monkfish for entrees - Don't forget a decent sake to compliment the Asian flavors on your palate. Thus far I can't brag enough to say that every order on this strong menu is going to be a homer, but if the menu above sets the pace - then we're all in for a treat. So why not the 5 star? Front of house was a bit off. Reservations were backed up (understandably in this small joint timing has got to be a massive pain) so we got to rub elbows a lot waiting in the corner for our seats and a couple of the specials were not available. Sure that's picky, but gotta lead with high standards I suppose. So, despite my pickiness don't let it deter you. Think fusion. Think Eurpoean-close. Think high-energy. And, think delish.

On a Sunday night, there isn't much beyond Italian to choose from in North Beach, so we opted to try out this place tucked into on of my favorite alleys of the area to get some variety. We were seated and served almost immediately; as we were a couple we got ahead of a group of five. Our waiter was 100% on top of his service and very personable, friendly and helpful with his suggestions. But I'm sorry, I can't give it 5 stars and hold to a strong 3.5. While the restaurant is clean, personable and relatively quiet considering the small space, there are a few things that took off the edge. I also don't eat seafood and my boyfriend opted for pork instead of seafood at last minute, so the menu was a bit limiting in that sense. Prices for appetizers and their size were decent, though! My steak was flavored well with teriyaki, but wasn't as rare as I would have liked for it to be and my potatoes were kind of flavorless for being garlic mash. His Kurobuta pork was more on a bbq style side, which is odd considering the nature of this pig. Kurobuta means "black pig" in Japanese, which is a rare type of British pig that is on par with Kobe beef in terms of its stature in the meat world. That being said, a lot of asian fusion restaurants that feature this like the mark-up capabilities and this is truly a tender pig. These guys did a pretty good job with getting across the tender layers with a crispy outside layer, but in terms of meat flavor, Yoshi's preparation was spot on in comparison. For dessert, an apple crumble for my man and cheesecake for me. I went with our waiter's suggestion over the coconut creme brulee with passionfruit compote, which sounded exotically appealing, and it was a very simple, classic dessert. I guess I wanted more "umph" and should have taken the leap with the creme brulee. I did also end up with an excellent chardonnay, which is rare as most chards are too dry for my tastes. Mostly, it was the table we were seated at that took things down the most. Behind the host stand by the door, which meant my boyfriend was feeling cramped by waiting customers and my feet were freezing from the draft coming in underneath the divider. So try to avoid sitting here; I'm sure this would have easily take the edge off and lead to a happy 4+ rating!

Came here for lunch today and the waitress managed to spill some of the soup from the udon I ordered on to the table. ÊFrom the table, it kept going and onto my pants. Ê Thanks for ruining my pants! Food was good though; they should have offered some type of compensation. ÊApologies were accepted but I think she might have been on the brink of a breakdown from the lunch service. ÊThe bf asked for no pepper and she started to rotate her pepper grinder only to realize he said No. ÊShe offered to take it back and have a new salad made but we were on a time constraint and couldn't wait anymore.

I been here a few times actually and I do love their food. Steamed mussels - very flavorful. Great to start the meal. I always get the wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak. This is definitely a must try. I also had the sea bass awhile back. I am definitely not a fish fan, but my cousins were telling me how yummy it is, so I gave it a try. It is good, but I am still not a fish fan.

Wow, what a great little find. The House is a gem. It's a super small space packed with lots of cool, young sophisticated people. Lots of young asian 20 somethings who look like they all have macs at home and who are super critical about their food. The House has extremely flavorful, seasoned entrees, many served with what seems to be their trademark, thick homemade round noodles. I had a stellar chicken breast over curry noodles... rich and comforting. My partner had ribeye over round noodles with kind of a rich, wasbi-ish sauce. Decadent and awesome. You will not be disappointed.

This place continues to blow my mind. I had the unagi sandwich, and it was the best sandwich I've ever had in my life, yes, even beats Ike's!!! It was impeccable - the unagi was juicy and tender, accentuated by the spicy mayo. Even the sandwich bread was toasted to the right level of crispiness! Everything about it was PERFECT, so perfect that I was tempted to add this to my "last meal" on my Yelp profile (but kept it deep fried porkchop rice due to sentimental reasons). If you want The House's finest without spending big bucks, get the unagi sandwich!!!

This place is awful. i came here based on recommendation and yelp reviews. I called the day of and was able to get reservations for two at the time i wanted. We were seated in the corner in the window in front of the door.. there were no other seats available at the time. Mind you the door was open and it was cold out, so i was cold my entire meal. i was excited about our meal here when i saw the plates of food on the neighboring table and was hoping that i would be able to get over the terrible seating arrangement of the place. ÊBut no, I was wrong, sadly. ÊWe ordered the scallops as an appetizer, but they were Êboring. Just scallops with some weird creamy sauce that tasted like cheese danish filling. The scallops themselves were good though. Nicely cooked, but wish it had a better sear. ÊOnto the entrees, we had the American Kobe beef special and the hamachi special. ÊThe American Kobe beef was ordered medium rare, how did it arrive? Over cooked and unevenly cooked. One half was rare and the other half was medium. Why? how do you unevenly cook a piece of meat? This doesn't make any sense to me, especially with all the rave reviews this place has. And the vegetables that came with it? Utterly bland. ÊEven a little bit of salt would have helped. The hamachi was served with a spicy miso broth, Chinese veggies, and a side of rice. The only good part of this dish was the white rice and spicy miso broth. The fish was terribly over cooked, and the veggies it came with were not fresh. It's hard to believe that the veggies weren't fresh when this place is a couple of blocks away from Chinatown. ÊThere is never anything redeeming about a dish when the main part of it is overcooked. The entire dish is ruined, no matter how tasty it might be. Overall, this place sucked in my book and I will never come back nor recommend it to anyone. Please do not come here, unless you want to be experience a horrible meal that is overcooked and boring.

We headed out to The House on a Friday night and had a reservation for 9pm. We were told it was going to be about 20 more minutes so we headed over to Tosca for a quick drink... Back at The House they sat us in the back which was actually quite nice because it was quieter (if that's possible here) and we were bale to have our own conversations without having to compete with the close neighbors. Food Rundown... Wine list had a bunch of nice Pinots which was a big plus and yes, they had a few for under 40 bucks (take note RNM). We ordered the Salmon, Ahi and Sea Bass and they were all amazing. Its crowded and loud and you may have to wait but its wort it for the fresh and tasty fusion dishes. Not good for a huge group, perfect for up to 4 people. Might want to hit it on a weekday night.

Interesting location, especially since its last address was at a larger site in the Sunset. ÊBy comparison, this place is hellllaaa small. In fact, even my apartment is larger, and that's not saying much. Still, it managed to accomodate all six of us. Bonus points as well for being able to accomodate us at a busy time for lunch even when we called on the same day, and changed the reservation twice. Foodwise, the appetizers were outstanding. ÊWe had the calamari, the salmon rolls, and the shrimp and pork dumplings. ÊEverything was prepared perfectly. ÊEven that fake salad garnish stuff was yummy. Surprisingly however the actual salads were terrible. One of my friends thought they may have forgotten the vinigrette on her chinese chicken salad because it lacked any flavor. ÊAnd even though my other friend's butter lettuce salad was drenched in dressing, it ALSO tasted rather bland. On the flipside, those of us who had actual entrees weren't disappointed. ÊWe especially enjoyed the tempura soft shell crab. ÊThe curry noodles with grilled chicken was also tasty. ÊAnd if they offer the ribeye sandwich again (it was today's special only), get it. ÊThe meat was extremely tender and tasty. Overall, I would still go back to the restaurant, if only to try more of the other dishes recommended by Êthe other Yelp reviewers. ÊHell, I'd go back just for the appetizers. Ê Three stars however for this restaurant because it's hard to mess up a salad and yet they did.

The portions are very reasonable. The steak was good too... Cooked just right, and pretty tender. For dessert we got the mango & tapioca, which was very good.

I've been eating here off and on over the years forever. It's like I go in cycles of wanting to eat here all the time and then not. The food is pretty solid although sometimes the menu is not true to the description of how something is prepared. A minor thing. The other day I had the caesar salad with scallops and it said grilled but it was fried. I mean it was still very good, it just wasn't what I was expecting. The shrimp dumpling are really lovely with or without the dipping sauce. I've also had the salmon (sometimes the side veggies for this are disappointing), sea bass, black bean chicken, curry noodles, wasabi noodles, chicken salad, steak and I forget what else. It was all good. Sometimes I do find that the flavors can be a little intense especially when the portions are large, it becomes hard to finish the whole plate.

There are VERY few places I'm willing to dish out 5 stars to, and those that I do honor with 5 stars, they truly deserve it. The House has got to be one of the best places I've eaten at. EVER. Our party of 4 was luckily seated within 30 minutes. Luckily because everyone coming in had reservations and the people already eating were enjoying themselves so much, they were taking their sweet time (people taking way too long to eat while others are waiting is one of my pet peeves, but I can understand why they were doing that here). So, moral of this paragraph, make reservations. The food itself is AMAZING. I think we literally, cleaned EVERY single thing they stuck in front of us (well maybe except the garnish). Started with the mussels... DELICIOUS. After we finished the mussels, my friend's folks spooned the sauce up and ate it too. I don't blame them, that shit was good. We also had the special soft shell crab. It was very good, but simply pales in comparison to the mains. For the mains, we had the steak and the mushroom risotto thing that was on the menu, along with the pork shoulder and miso cod special. Each of those mains merits its own post-sex cigarette. MMMMMM.... I had the miso cod that was topped with a California roll. It was innovative, tasted great, and priced just right. As for the dessert, we had the mango tapioca (Damn that was good...), and the chocolate truffle cake thingy (good, but mango tapioca surpassed it). Oh and the prices aren't that expensive. For the area, and the quality of food you get, I thought it was great. Our 2 appetizers, 4 mains, 2 desserts, my wine, an Arnold Palmer, a lemonade, tax and tip came out to be 175. I've had meals 5 times that price, but no where near as satisfied with my meal. Parking sucked, but theres a cheap garage up by Vallejo street thats pretty cheap for SF standards. SF has a reputation for being a food lover's city, and I think The House is a PERFECT example of a place to go if you love food.

For the quality of food and the price you pay, it was definitely worth it. It was the three of us and we had 2 glasses of wine, 1 appetizer (mussels), and 3 entrees (ribeye, ahi tuna, and quail), all for $100. Not a bad deal considering that the food was pretty damn good. The place is a bit small and seating is tight, I highly recommend making a reservation before showing up. I recommend you try this: You must order the mussels and ask for a bowl of white rice. Pour the sauce from the mussel over the rice and eat. It's simple but freakin good.

For dessert, apple pie a la mode and creme brulee topped with passion fruit purree. I'm a creme brulee lover but I wasn't having the passion fruit purree. The service was splendid.

Quite the unassuming spot.

Who made me the doorman of this place? While waiting for our table, the staff asked us to prop the door open because it was getting stuffy in the back. Then, patrons asked us to close it because they were getting cold. THEN the staff came back and told us not to close it! Patrons got cold again! It was frustrating...I'm just going to wait outside next time! We made a reservation for a big group here...which I don't really recommend. The "house" is pretty much just 1 Kitchen and 1 Bedroom...tiny! The reservation was for 7:30pm, but the tables were not put together until 8:15pm. I don't blame them though. The menu may seem a little small, but they have appetizer and entree specials that your waitress will recite to you. I was pretty nervous for her as she was reciting the specials...props to her for memorizing it all! I decided to go with the sea bass. It came with string beans and noodles. I didn't think I would be full, but it was a pretty good serving. The sea bass was cooked very well...but I think I've had better. The dipping sauce was a little on the salty side, along with the noodles and string beans. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed it. Reservations only!

Ê Although the words "Asian-Fusion" always makes me sneer a bit, the dishes were very tasty. ÊIt is definitely not a place where just throwing on some bean sprouts makes the dish "asian-fusion."

ÊWine list not the best - and don't expect your server to know anything about the wines. ÊBut the servers are nice! Ê:) 4. ÊAppetizer - $10 for a half dozen oysters - we've had better, namely, at Slanted Door. 5. ÊEntree - $17 for the wasabi noodles and grilled flank steak - not bad. Ê 6. ÊDessert - got the chocolate truffle cake with coffee ice cream. ÊA little too sweet but the ice cream was divine. Would I come back here? ÊIf someone invited me, sure. ÊIf I had to choose a place to eat, probably not. Ê3.5 stars.

This place is incredible. ÊThe service is great, atmosphere very pleasant, and the food is out of this world. I've been here 3 times now. ÊMy boyfriend and I came here on our first date and back here on our 1 year anniversary and both times the food was amazing. ÊIf you come here, you have to get the "roasted unagi" appetizer. ÊAlthough it sounds random, this appetizer is delicious. ÊEel is tender and although I usually don't like Sushi, this was just incredible. My boyfriend always gets the flat iron steak over wasabi noodles. ÊThe noodles are delish and the steak is always cooked to perfection. ÊRecently I tried their "blackened cod special with an avocado roll". ÊThe cod almost melted in my mouth and the roll was delicious. Ê I can't emphasize enough how yummy this place is. ÊHighly recommend it and it's one of my favorite places in the city.

I loved The House when i went the first time a few years ago and was excited to return last weekend. ÊWe were sat immediately with reservations (which seems more and more rare these days) and the hostess was super nice. Ê But then my date and I must have had a new server and she was pretty miserable. ÊI had to ask her to slow the service down - we were feeling very rushed and being thrown dishes like 3 minutes after we ordered them, as if they were pre-made - and she was too attentive, coming back to the table 4 or 5 times asking if everything was OK. ÊThe gripe list also includes the wine, which was served too warm, and a generally very loud atmosphere (but I'm 32 now and probably just getting crotchety). The food was good but nothing i would consider spectacular or particularly inventive. ÊHere, three days later, i'm struggling to remember what all we ordered. Êage-related memory loss aside, that's not a good sign.

Even though the restaurant was very small, it still had a cute, quaint atmosphere about it. I remember when I ate here maybe when I was a freshmen in high school (when it was still on Irving Street) and it was one of the most memorable meals I ever had. When my friend asked me to eat "The HouSe" I was like.. I remember that place! That place was shiznets!!! N-e-who... I ordered the seabass....mMmmMm... melted in my mouth. The fish was so tender. It came with some udon type noodles that was great cuz I'm a big noodle fanatic. It also came with some asparagus that complemented the fish very nicely. For appetizers we had the special, Kobe-short-rib salad with mango n some other junnk.... DELLICIOUS! The meat melted in my mouth tOo! I kept making moaning sounds everytime I took a bite, it was that good! I most def. recommend this place! Its reasonably priced for a date restaurant. For me and my friend, 2 entrees, 2 appetizers, a half bottle of wine = about $100.. not bad not bad. The food was as good as some of those fancy shamncy restaurants u pay an arm n a leg for.

ÊThe pickled side dish is good too...kind of cleanses the palate. I order the cod dish...first bite...OMG, this is soooo good. ÊBut as I kept eating, the dish started to taste way too salty for me.

What a quaint little "house". Small as it may be, this place is modern and lively. The food is intricate and the attention to detail is apparent. Don't skip dessert as strange as it may sound. Their mango tapioca soup (not sure of the exact name) is unusually delicious and satisfying.

Such a cozy, and cute Japanese fusion restaurant. ÊWonderful service with good food. Ê The only drawback is that the place is a bit confined, so that it cannot accommodate a large group. ÊWhen we went there last time for our friend's birthday party (a party of 11), we had to wait a while for a table even with a reservation. ÊIt was Friday night so I expected to wait, but it was just a bit too tight for all of us. ÊThe tables are pushed together, and everyone's elbow was touching each other ... The food is great, well prepared and cooked for perfection. ÊTheir drink selection is also good as well.

Pro's *Small plates: Tuna tartar with nori chips. A MUST! Unagi with avocado wasabi rice. Again another plus. *Ambiance and atmosphere was very pleasant. Con's *Calamari: It looked more like pop corn shrimp and was heavily battered. I would not order again. I will need to check this place out again since I came when I wasn't super hungry and didn't try any entrees or the flour less chocolate cake, both which I've heard are delish! P.S. They only allow you to use 2 credit cards when paying. So either bring Cash or figure out who's paying before hand.

5 words: Unagi with Avacado Wasabi Rice. Okay, more words. The service is great, the freshness of the food is great, and best of all, they are consistent in their quality of food and service. It can get a little cramped at times, especially by the door, but you can easily avoid that by making reservations :)

I had 1 night for dinner with my middle school, high school, college friends in the city. I was adamantly told by my friends in oakland that I should try this place. So I did. For all my friends who joined dinner with me (10 people total), were all speechless with the food. Since most of my friends are diverse ethnically, I was a bit worried about the asian-fusion joint such as this, but I think i've just made them the biggest "the house" fan there is. we tried almost every single "small plate" and "dinner". no one complained about their food, and only shared a bite SO we can try other plates. MUST try : small plate: Ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips Deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard and whatever the waitress says about the special... they're truly "special". dinner: Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak Mushroom rice with grilled prawns Grilled ahi tuna (rare) with spicy mustard aioli Chicken breast with roasted portabella white truffle oil sauce Niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce Angus ribeye steak, housemade teriyaki, toasted garlic butter warning.... although I'm bad for this... DO NOT GO IN LARGE GROUPS! the restaurant is really really small. and even with a credit card reserved reservations, we still had to wait coo 30 minutes before being seated. enjoy~

I would give this place 5 stars but for the tiny space and the tiny voices of the wait staff. ÊSo under the minus column you have their long list of specials that they make their wait staff memorize.

Ok this place *was* fabulous!

ÊThey were not particularly pleasant on the phone nor was the hostess nice in person either. ÊI would give it a 5 except for the service - we did have to wait a bit, and he didn't want to take the time to allow us to ask questions really. They do have a lot of specials, we had 3 apps (fresh calamari, chicken liver salad and clams), 2 of the special mains (kobe steak and black cod) and 3 deserts (creme brulee, chocolate torte, apple pie). It was all absolutely delicious, great champagne, good wine, an excellent choice anytime!

The first time I dined at the House was over 10 years ago when I flew into the city to visit my sister. ÊI was impressed with the the mostly grilled / pan seared meats fused with distinctively Chinese and Japanese seasoning and sauces. Ê I decided to revisit the House 10 years later to see if the food is as good as I remembered. ÊWe started with 2 excellent appetizers - Unagi with Orzo and Monterey Calamari with a spicy tomato sauce. ÊThe Unagi was a generous piece of eel charbroiled to perfection. ÊThe flavor was smoky and slightly sweet. ÊThere is a trace of Avocado between the Unagi and the Orzo. ÊThe Calamari was also Charbroiled drenched in a slightly spicy smoky tomato sauce. Ê For the mains, we ordered a seared Hamachi (yellow tail) with a crab sushi roll over yu-choi (Chinese Greens) and Ginger Soy Sea Bass with Fresh noodles and Chinese Long Beans. The Sea Bass was excellent. ÊThe fish was moist, buttery. ÊThe ginger sauce, Êserved on the side, was good. ÊThe fresh Chinese noodles which were lightly stir-fried, had a very nice texture, although just a touch greasy. Ê The seared Yellow Tail was more ordinary as were the crab sushi rolls that came with it. ÊThe fish was slightly over seared /cooked for my taste. ÊIt was closer to medium well rather than medium rare, what I expect of seared fish. The verdict? ÊThe food is still very good, although not quite as good as I remembered. ÊThe vegetables and noodles, although very good, were a touch too greasy especially in combination with the Sea Bass which is a oily, high-fat content fish. Ê The price was very reasonable. ÊWe spent around $45 per person including a large bottle of Pellegrino tip and tax. The House is a small restaurant and it's still a popular place even after all these years. ÊIt's in the heart of North Beach so parking is very difficult. ÊIf you decide to try The House, go early or make a reservation before you go.

A friends of mine introduced me to this place for dinner last night. ÊI had never heard of it, but apparently it's a small but popular neighborhood destination for 20 somethings. ÊDespite being seated less than a foot from the tables adjacent to our two top, I had a great time. ÊAfter waiting about 45 minutes (no reservation on a Saturday night), we were seated and all skepticism was methodically put to rest. I was immediately a critic of the size of the restaurant, but they compensate with a high quality dining experience. ÊI'm not just talking about the food here, it's all the little things: menu selections, service, and ambience. ÊI was surprised to see that most entrees were $20 or less, considering the type of ingredients put into play. ÊThis included an impressive array of fish and even foie gras! ÊThe service was definitely up to par as well. ÊOur server was very attentive, especially and most importantly with the drinks. ÊThe interior has a very neutral but contemporary feel, with heavy use of woodgrain that is complimentary to the overall image they are trying to achieve. Whenever I hear "Asian fusion," I can't help but roll my eyes in dismay reminiscing on less-than-exceptional cuisine from Dr. Frankenstein's monster known as PF Chang's. ÊHowever, The House's chefs have done a great job of blending a selection of Asian inspired ingredients that can also be found locally. ÊI like to think of it as Californian cuisine. ÊWe ordered the mussels in a spicy broth, which was unusual but delicious. ÊI ordered the soy glazed salmon in sake broth while she opted for her old faithful, flat iron steak with wasabe? noodles. ÊThe steak was amazingly flavorful and cooked a perfect medium rare. ÊMy salmon was very savory as well and went great with the broth. ÊI was impressed with the presentation of the dish: the salmon resting on a bed of greens so as not to become soggy in the broth and garnished with a spoonful of tobiko, cleverly resembling caviar. Most importantly, the beer and wine selection was surprisingly diverse. ÊThere were more than a couple international brews that I wasn't familiar with at all, but I ended up sticking with some Japanese rice ale. ÊIt was what Robin is to Batman. Overall, the experience was an exceptional value. ÊClassy without being pretentious. ÊI would definitely come back here again, but next time with a reservation.

Me and my girls visited SF and the first place we dined was The House and LOVED IT! ÊOf couse I found out about this place through yelping and I'm glad because it satisfied me. PROS 1) Nice services. I wouldn't say spectacular but I did appreciate them coming back after each meal to replace our utensils. 2) Atmosphere is very cozy and nice. 3) Dishes - I ordered the fish special yellow tail which was surprisingly delicious. Every bite was very tasteful. Although the California roll on top wasn't too great. It was just there really for presentation. I would definitely recommend this dish. My friends ordered beef noodles which was alright - noodles was great but steak was a little too chewy. Dessert - definitely recommend Mango Tapioca which was very smooth and tasty. CONS 1) It looks like shit from the outside. My friends thought I was crazy to make reservation for this place. But please don't judge a book by it's cover. It's pretty decent from the inside. 2) They sat us down right away since we made reservations (highly recommend). However the place was so crowded that your elbows will touch your neighbors. A little too small for a big person. 3) Price is expensive. Ê3 entres and a dessert for ~$110 with tip. Maybe it's worth it. 4) It took awhile for us to get our check. I've seen only 3 servers. We really had to wave our hands to catch their attention. Took about 20 minutes for our check. 5) The one restroom was in a really crowded area in the back next to the kitchen which was a bothersome if u stand and wait there because the servers will keep coming back and forth and ask u to move because you're standing next to their stack of unwashed dishes. Overall, I do recommend this place because of the tasty food. But nothing spectacular. Definitely make reservations.

Highlights: food both in flavor and presentation. The black cod is very tasty, so were the fried calamari (which are usually bland at other places). Let-down: service sucks. From downright dismissive, to another occasion when a waiter came to our table, and started to pull the table as we were eating so as to make room for other diners. I would have appreciated at least him asking our permission, rather than do it directly.

The place is small and you're sitting quite close to each other. ÊThe service is pretty good. Mussels - delish...love the sauce, but no bread to go with the sauce. Ê Garlic noodles with flank steak - love the garlic noodles and the steak had a great sauce Steak dish - not bad, but it's just ok Chocolate cake - yuummy, but it's just ok too I would come back, but there's so much options around North Beach that if I didn't have reservations I wouldn't wait.

The House is tasty. ÊThe House is cozy. ÊParking around The House sucks. Once you park in the lot several blocks away from the restaurant (after circling North Beach for the better part of the night), you enter the warm little restaurant. ÊWe were greeted by our frazzled-appearing hostess who found our names on the reservation list (I would reserve). ÊShe promptly seated us next to this older, friendly couple who educated us on the menu and The House experience. ÊStart with the appetizers (ahi tuna tartare on roasted nori chips), follow it with the entree (I had the pork chop and the Ms. had the sea bass), and conclude the night with some debauchery in North Beach...wait, that's another story.

This is the 2nd time I've been to the house, both times the food was consistently good. The 1st time was years ago, we ordered a ton and gorged ourselves, I've been thinking about going back ever since... We've tried time and time again to come back, but this place is quite hard to get in to and the stars never aligned. The 2nd time around was not as good as the first since I'm in a vegetarian phase at the moment (not much choice at this place for veggies) or maybe I've built this place up too much in my own mind over the years. I ordered the wasabi noodles with veggies, it was just alright...S.B. ordered the rib eye, I wasn't tempted to break my veggie streak and try it because it looked super grisly. ÊThe mango tapioca we ordered for dessert had great consistency and texture, but not enough mango flavor... In any case, the service is still as great as I remembered it the first time...Oh well.

Normally I am leery of the term Asian Fusion but The House totally sets the standard. After reading so much about the pork belly app, we were sad to see it was not on the menu. Because the occasion was my boyfriend's birthday, we ventured to ask our waiter if they could do it anyway, and what do you know! They had one left. Hurray! And it was DIVINE! No exaggeration here. My boyfriend had the seabass and I had the cod. Both pieces of fish were perfectly cooked. The garlic noodles were also incredible and the portions were big enough that we took home leftovers... Who knew that garlic noodles could be such a great start to your day!

As a Bay Area native and 6-year resident of San Francisco, I know the cardinal rule: Do not expect to find amazing food in North Beach. Ê Well let me be the first to apologize to The House for the generalization. ÊYou are like a diamond in the rough! Ê We celebrated our friend's 30th birthday this past weekend at The House and it was just a fabulous meal. ÊAt first, I was put off by the 10PM dinner reservation for a party of 8 but the place is definitely snug ... and loud. ÊHowever, the food, service and price more than makeup for the size and acoustics. Ê The tuna tartare was excellent but I have to say, ÊI cannot ... CANNOT ... stop thinking of the seared sea scallops. ÊWow, they were amazing. ÊTo the point were I was thinking of going for lunch today since it's only 5 blocks from my office. ÊThe husband -- who is not a seafood guy -- really enjoyed his flat iron steak. ÊOur friends raved about the salmon rolls and the fried green beans. Ê All in all, it was a fabulous meal. ÊAlso, bonus point to the server who got our entire order correct and timed the meal fabulously. Ê PLEASE NOTE: Êthey only accept 2 credit cards per bill. ÊSo if you bring a large party, make sure you have CASH! The House ... I will be seeing you soon! ÊI look forward to dining there again soon. ÊMeanwhile, I will try my best to forget about those scallops, but they are haunting me!

Sea bass = great dish. Can't go wrong with sea bass. Then again, even I can cook sea bass, and I've given myself food poisoning before....point being, sea bass isn't difficult to cook. Kobe beef, the special I ordered, well, I wasn't impressed. The beef was dry, even though I ordered it medium rare. My sister ordered the flat iron steak, and that was CHEWY. Difficult to cut even with the steak knives they provided; even then, the flat iron steak tasted better than the Kobe. Service was okay. We got our food quickly. When my sister made the reservation, we were told we had to be finished in exactly 1.5 hours, which we were fine with since we had a large party and it was a small place. So for those looking to book a large party, be aware they impose a time limit for your party, so it's not a good place to linger. I likely won't be back unless a friend wants to go there for a birthday or something.

The Best Meal of 2009. Seriously its really amazing. Highly recommend the "crab cake" and seared Tuna. The Chef is really creative and you can taste complimenting complex flavors. All their dishes gives your taste buds a ZZZzzing of flavors. We were sooooo stuffed but still managed to order the coconut passion fruit creme brulee. Once again did not disapoint us one bit.

Went here for my sister bachlorette party dinner with 4 of her friends, in October. Dinner was good!! We shared 2 appetizers; calamari & something else (can't remember). Each got a entree; I got the cod with california roll. Got 2 creme brulee for dessert. The atmosphere was nice & cozy (bit small tho, about 20 tables). Service was good. The wait was a bit long since we had a reservation, but we had to wait for another party of 6 to finish up, for us to be seated. I would like to go again and try their other yummy dishes!

Hmmm. It's not bad, but I just didn't have a 5-star experience here. Fusion versions of traditional dishes should be as good or better than . . . right? Unfortunately, it was hit and miss the night we strolled in. The miso black cod dish, common to Japan, was undercooked. Althought the miso sauce was suped up for added flavor, and it wasn't bad (but too salty), it wasn't as good as the dish it's based on. The tsukemono starter (pickled cucumbers) were just too vinegary. Their California roll was very good. Their unique versions of salmon rolls and unagi were tasty. The desserts, especially the mango tapioca, were delicious. Overall, the food was artistically presented. The service was friendly and attentive. The ambiance was nothing special, but clean. A dinner for two with one dessert and one drink each was over $100 . . . not a great value for dinner, and this is the X-factor to rating. 3.5 Stars

And the food was amazing! The Sea bass dish is often raved about and it is definitely not over-hyped. ÊI loved every bite that I stole my friends plate. Ê I opted for the pork chop and was very pleased with that as well. ÊJuicy meat and a most delicious pomegranate currant sauce. Ê Pretty good sized portions so I had some left for lunch the next day and it was still delicious. Ê The restaurant itself is TINY, so you're probably better off if you make reservations.

GRILLED SEA BASS WITH GARLIC GINGER SOY is amazing, it made me forget about the restaurant's tight space, low ceiling and the lingering strong seafood smell (I love seafood but I can't stand its smell forever circulating with the air I'm breathing and making my clothes smell). But really, that sea bass is so delicious, I didn't mind any of the above as soon as I took my first bite. I even almost refused to share a couple of bites with a companion. My friend had mushroom rice with grilled prawns and it was delish too (not as great as the sea bass though!) Come here, ignore the size of the place and the odor inside. The food is worth all that trouble. I recommend making reservations as this place gets packed.

I give The House a solid four stars. The presentation at this Asian fusion restaurant is exquisite and the food almost matches up to it! Why almost? It's because some of the food was a bit too heavy and oily. Get the pork chop when you go! You will not be disappointed. Also, the atmosphere is definitely not upscale. It's a fine dining place with a very casual feel. There is also a lot of background noise. The rundown of my meal: Crabcake: One big crabcake that's beautifully laid out on the plate. It was pretty good. You'll have to split it with your fork if you want to share it with your eating partner. Sea bass: Melts in your mouth. The noodles it came with was a little bit too greasy, but still yummy. Reminds me of fried yaki udon. Pork chop: The flavor is perfectly ripe, and it's definitely not overkill. Mashed potatoes were a bit too buttery but it was a great complement. Dessert: Apple pie was so-so

Wow, this place has amazing reviews! The House is one of my all time favorite restaurants in the city. ÊI eat here for special occasions, and I send out of towners here - it never disappoints. Ê I think what separates The House from other city restaurants is not just the wonderful food - it's the value. There is nothing more frustrating than spending $$$$ on a meal that's just eh. Here, the entrees range from 17-25 or so, which - for how freaking good this food is - is awesome for the city. The food is always so inventive. The flavors...wow. ÊI recommend listening very carefully to the specials - that's the money spot. ÊEvery night they have several specials that are usually to die for. If you make it past the specials...the ahi tuna with the mustard sauce is sooooooo tasty. ÊAlso the Seabass is another favorite, although not as inventive as the ahi. You definitely need a reservation here. ÊIt's very small. Enjoy!!

Have you ever fallen in love? When I first took a bite of what I order, it was like I fallen in love. There are no words to describe how much I love this place. I absolutely love this place. It's a place you wouldn't expect to be so mind-blowing in your mouth because the restaurant is so small. It's not even noticeable to the naked eye because you could so easily just walk past this restaurant when there are so many many other restaurants that are in that area. Anyway the first time I came here I ordered the steak. OMG...it was so delicious. There is no steak in my library that compares to this steak. I mean it's not even a restaurant made to eat steak but its just so flavorful and it even has the look. They chopped garlic into little pieces and roasted it and put it on top of the beautiful steak. I took a bite and I just fallen in love. I usually hate eating the fat on a steak...but the fat in the steak was so wonderful that the whole steak was devour by me in a matter of minutes. WELL I also tried the appetizers which was pretty good. It wasn't anything I clearly remembered so it doesn't really matter if you get it or not. Anyway my other two friend got fish. Not only was my steak absolutely mind blowing but the seafood they got was astonishing. They paired up with the fish so well that you just don't want to stop eating it and just lick everything off the plate. The fish is so smooth and tender that GAH I really wanted to go back to SF right now to eat it. This asian fusion restaurant is small and have a small menu but everything on the menu is just wonderful. If you live in SF and you haven't tried this place out yet then you are absolutely missing out on one of the best place ever. Go now and try it I tell you because if i live in SF you would see me day and night. :)

Went on a Friday night (with reservation), very good and attentive service, good entres (cod and ahi una), desert (pudding) and appetizer (beef salad)- so-so. One really annoying part - noise, just impossible. This place is very popular and crowded but too small and gets noisy fast.

What an awesome place! We made a reservation to eat here on 11/6/2010 (made on thursday...how lucky is that?!) and we could not have had a better experience. To start we had White shrimp and chinese chive dumplings and seared scallops (daily special). The dumplings were very tasty, and the scallops were cooked perfectly...they tasted excellent. For main course, my wife had miso cod with california rolls and I had mahi mahi over curry with mussels (both were daily specials). Both fish were perfect. Her california rolls were made with real crab, and pretty good. The curry in my dish was very good, mixed with jalapeno peppers, potatoes and corn and the mussels were the best ones I've ever had. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy a cozy meal with great food.

yummy food ftw!!! it's pretty hard to get seated at this place because of its popularity, however, the food is for sure worth the wait!. came here for their sea bass with noodles, and steak with wasabi noodles. the sea bass was grilled to perfection, it's tender and juicy by itself, when dipped in the sesame ginger soy sauce it came with, the flavor profile became even more interesting. the noodle on the side was also very flavorful and chewy, what a great dish! the steak with wasabi noodles was interesting, while the steak was cooked just right, perfectly tender and seasoned, i wasnt too big of a fan for the wasabi noodles. dont get me wrong, i love wasabi in general, but when it's blended with noodles, the spicy level went down to about zero and only a hint of wasabi flavor was left . maybe im just not used to it, b/c whenever i have wasabi, i want to have a little kick from the spice, but i wasnt getting it in the noddle dish *shrug*, this could just be a personal preference. also tried the steamed mussels in shrimp broth, it's divine!!! sooooo flavorful and fresh-tasting! if you are trying to decide what appetitizer to try, definitely give the mussels a shot, they are great!

I had the deep fried salmon roll and the tuna BLT. Ê The deep fried salmon roll was pretty good. ÊI liked the little salad it sat on top of. The tuna BLT exceeded expectations. ÊWho knew that the flavors of tuna could be a complement to bacon? Dishes are nicely dressed. ÊThe restaurant itself looked so simple and unassuming that having stylized food was a pleasant surprise.

Larry and Angela Tse (and their son that works as a busboy!) make this THE restaurant in San Francisco. The House is the epitome of Asian Fusion (which is/was all the rage) cuisine. The flavors are matched perfectly. You can't go wrong with any dish you choose from appetizers to desserts. Huge portions, low prices, friendly people! I certainly miss the 9th Ave place but the North Beach will do just fine. Go here, please.

I've been to the House many times over the years, even to the one that used to be on 9th, and I never tried the mango tapioca pudding until last week, and let me tell you that I will go back just to have it! ÊIt was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. ÊI am typically the "okay, let's get a dessert but share" type of person because I will have on or two bite, but I think I embarrassed myself cuz I was shoveling the mango pudding into my mouth...seriously, THAT good. Okay, the rest of the meal...they do fish really, really well. ÊThey are famous for their sea bass, which is good, but I'm just not in love with sea bass anymore. ÊThey had a seared hamachi special that was not only presented beautifully, but was very delicious. Ê As for the rest of the food, the appetizers were good, but nothing amazing, that's why I docked it one star, appetizers are my favorite. We had a server who was on her own for the first night and she was nice enough, but unfortunately, we had a lot of questions. ÊThe waiter that helped her out was really nice, attentive and knowledgeable. We always have a good time there and when this particular friend visits, we know where we're heading for dinner cuz he picks the house EVERY time.

From our foodie mom: We started out with two appetizers....AMAZING!!!!!!!!! Salmon with skin eggroll lightly fried in a thin crust .....beautifully presented on a bed of different colored (green, orange, red) pickled cabbage/carrot/onion mixture. They came presented in sort of a tapered, angle-pointed shape flaring design topped with orange caviar with a mustardy dipping sauce. Oh My GOSH!!!....it was soooooooooo delicious!! Encrusted Crab Cake... so beautifully presented that you didn't want to cut in to it! It arrived shaped like a standing pear (size of one too!) with a long orange fried root coming out of the top of it.... sitting on a bed of green onions mixed with different stuff..not sure what ....then surrounded by some really bright green pureed chlorophyll type leaf (basil?) in oil with a touch of black caviar. YUMMY!!!! Now for our entree: Again, presentation was wonderful! Grilled Hamachi Ê(yellowtail) Êtopped with 3 different types of sushi..sitting on a bed of baby bok choy...surrounded by a circle of green pureed sauce in oil and a squiggle of a mayo spiced sauce. Grilled sea bass with a side of udon noodles and sauteed green beans with Êfried ginger in a dipping sauce. OH MY GOSH again!!!!! the sea bass was SOOOO delicious!! Its kinda of a chi-chi place, noisy, and not where you would sit and dine for hours.... so we were out of there in about a hour

Pretty darn good food. I had the ahi tuna tartare which had WAY too much wasabi in there but the main course redeemed itself - house noodles with flatiron steak and my friend had the special - sea bass with cali rolls which was delicious.

Janice says: ÊGreat way to make it a day! ÊI love coming here with my bf and we have yet to try everything. ÊOnce we went early around 6:30ish and actually got seats right away before the rush. ÊOtherwise, having reservations is a good idea since there's only like 20 small tables. FOOD: ÊI've tried the pork chops and chicken and as much as you don't really expect much out from these ordinary selections, it comes out very decorative and surprisingly tasty! ÊDerek ordered the steak and noodle one time and I didn't like it. ÊBut he ordered the steak another time with different sides and it was great. Ê DESSERT: ÊIt's not bad, but not spectacular. Êthey had this berry cobbler once and that was okay. Êthe creme brulee was good. ÊIf you still have room for it then I say go for it. I have to try the sea bass next time! Derek Says: ÊThis is one of my favorite restaurants in the bay area. ÊI first tried this restaurant because my uncle gave me a gift card for 50 dollars there. ÊI failed twice going there until i finally made a reservation a week before. ÊThat was maybe 2 years ago, Êim not sure if its still as busy. ÊThe last time me and janice went and it was absolutely perfect because we were hungry at 6:30 and there wasn't a wait at all. Ê Food: ÊI always thought they cook everything just right not too cooked not too rare. ÊI like the steak and noodle dish there. Êeverything comes out from the kitchen like a piece of art. Êthere are many different flavors with the various sauces on the plate Everyone should try The House. ÊThe prices are around 15-25 for a entree. ÊI would say about 60 a couple with dessert or wine..

Right, so as of 5/21, this place has 4.5 starts over 251 reviews. You do the math. This place deserves a 5 star rating. Great food, nice ambience, semi-decent service, but the food is good that nothing can really beat that. The place is small-ish (seats about 40 at best). I went here on a Friday night with a friend, and we had reservations for 9.30. They didn't seat us till about 10.15, and while I was a little irritated at first, after the food, I didn't care. So, bottom-line, make reservations, but don't expect them to honor it :) As kind of a peace offering for making us wait, we got Salmon Roll appetizers on the house (non pun intended). It was delish. I loved it. We also got the lobster tail appetizer, which was a special, and it was just awesomely awesome. It was so good. My mouth's watering as I think about it. I got the Grilled Sea Bass, which in all honesty, I could have had a lot more of, not because they didn't give me a large enough portion, but it was so damned good that I couldn't stop eating. My friend got seasme king salmon, which he said was phenomenal as well. And for dessert, I got the choclate something, and my friend got the mango tapioca something, and they were both awesome. Bottom-line, make reservations, and go early. And enjoy. ai PS: It was a friday night, and I was running late, and its almost impossible to catch a cab in the Marina (by where I live). So I decided to drive and parked at the North Beach garage and walked the 3 blocks to this place. So totally worth it.

MMMMMMM. ÊI can't wait to go eat here again. TUNA TARTARE: If you like spicy food (like I do), then you will like this. ÊI normally need to eat raw peppers straight to feel the heat, but this one had a nice kick that I could actually taste. MUSHROOM SOUP: Really flavorful and rich. SHRIMP AND MANGO SALAD: The shrimp was browned perfectly with a flavorful curry/white sauce. ÊThin slices of mango added a nice sweet accent to the otherwise savory salad. COD IN COCONUT CURRY, w/FINGERLING POTATOES, CORN, PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND MUSSELS: I normally don't really like fish dishes, but the cod was firm and meaty. ÊIt was marinated with some sort of sweet glaze. ÊThe sauce was very thin and mildly flavored, with just a hint of curry and coconut. BLUEBERRY BREAD PUDDING: To die for. ÊThe bread was soooo good. ÊLight and fluffy with plump blueberries. CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE CAKE: Very rich and thick. ÊComes with coffee ice cream. WASABI NOODLES: I could eat this everyday. ÊSo tasty.

Came here for a work dinner....I had to fight one of my coworkers in order to dine here. ÊHe wanted to take everyone out to Chinese food in Chinatown (yes, the night prior he rounded up the troops and took them to Woot WooT Fisherman's Wharf. ÊI mean, why not follow it up with Chinese Food at Chinatown and perhaps a trolley ride!). ÊI mean, you expect out-of-towners to not know that great restaurants and bars do actually exist outside of the areas saturated with Alcatraz Snowglobes and I Heart SF t-shirts, but you don't expect them to argue with a local about dinner. Ê So there was kind of a lot riding on this meal. ÊIf I fucked up I would have been the office ass who ruined everyones night after militantly demanding we go to someplace genuine. Ê So The House had reservations for us and even allowed me to move them around a bit as is typically needed when going with a large group. ÊWe showed up and I have to admit I was a little disappointed. ÊThe decor was more Sushi joint than Fancy restaurant. ÊAnd the heat lamp lights were a bit much....but the food was pretty outstanding. ÊYes, I'd give it a solid 4 stars. ÊAnd I thought it was pretty reasonable. ÊI would have liked some mix drinks, but was fine with ordering sake after sake. Ê Everyone I went with commented on how great the food was, but it was very clear that the overall experience was a bit of a let down.

I had the black cod here -- melt-in-your-mouth OMG experience! My friend was so jealous (she liked her ahi, but still...); the women next to us kept eyeing our food and ordered what we got. The tempura long bean appetizer was delicious! Thanks for the yelpers who recommended it! The service was fairly decent -- it was hard to hear the waiter, and I was distracted anyway because she looked like a hipper version of one of my cousins (weird).

I enjoyed my visit to this tiny restaurant. The oysters on the half shell with spicy cilantro mignonette is lovely, as is the warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak. However, the first set of glass cups set on our table had lipstick marks on them (ugh!). Our waitress seemed a bit annoyed when we asked for new cups. They are incredibly busy, so we tried our best to be understanding. I would have given them 5 stars if it wasn't for the hasty waitress.

I was kind of 'over' Asian Fusion cuisine - until I went to The House. If you are into good food and don't mind the minor nuances of small spaces and long waiting, then this place is for you. The food really was unique in the combination of flavors, texture and presentation. Each dish we ordered was quite good - Deep Fried Salmon Roll, Grilled Sea Bass with Garlic Ginger Soy, and Wasabi Noodles and Flat Iron Steak. Ê I wish we had more people in our party to try a few more dishes, then again that wouldn't be possible due to the lack of space. We had 3 people in our party and it felt like 2 too many. The food is really good, but don't let your expectations wander too far away from that.

ÊTheir food is not that memorable since I don't remember what I had. I think I had the curry but for me not to remember what I ate is a bad thing since I loooove, wait, LOVE food; ÊFood I breathe, food I sleep, food I eat, food I poop. Service was good...it was during peak hours and I did not feel ignored, folks were attentive, gave me my free water refills...

I don't even know where to start....how about the appetizers. The best has be the Roasted Unagi over Avocado Sushi Rice. I order it every time I go there (and that is quite a bit). Also a great special that I had on Saturday, the Kobe Beef and Papaya Salad! Entrees you ask? I have had almost all of them and each is better than the one before. My top favorites are the Sea Bass, Ahi Tuna with Spicy Mustard Aioli, and of course, the Mushroom Rice with Grilled Prawns. This establishment is cozy and the food is excellent.

This place is pretty darn good. The 575 Yelpers and 4.5 stars won't lie to you. I tried their black cod special with california roll. The fish literally melts in your mouth and the smooth teriyaki/soy sauce is a terrific pairing to the fish. The california roll was presented beautifully and very fresh. (Actually, it was more like a california strip. Instead of those little short rolls you typically get at sushi restaurants, the House made them into long strips filled with the same ingredients. Very unique.) I am, however, taking away 1 star because the sauce got waaaay too salty after awhile. Perhaps some noodles and rice on the side would've helped. (God, I'm so Asian!) The sea bass is also very delicious. Service was decent and attentive. Decor - simple, and casual. Not incredibly romantic, but it would be a great hangout for friends/family. This is a tiny restaurant in the North Beach area - so be sure to make reservations. It gets busy!

We were sitting next to a large group that seemed to order evey dessert on the menu, which made us have to try one of the desserts, so we tried the pomegranate creme brule. Mmmmmm! Delish!

There was a great deep-fried salmon roll while still raw in the middle, really really good with mustard sauce I think, well it was ridiculously good. And we ordered two more appetizers that was the special for the day, can't recall the names, but nevertheless it was amazing as well. We ordered the rib-eye, fillet mignon, porkchop and I think it was the fish... they were really good. desert was amazing as well, although I heard it was impossible to get reservations we got lucky, and it is pretty crowded since the restaurant is super tiny. but its all about the food right? the service was excellent too.

This place is fancier than what I am accustomed to. Good experience, kind of pricey, but not overly expensive. Food was superb. Kudos to the tuna tartar. Staff was super friendly and checked on us frequently. Rate 3.5= (-0.5) for price & (-1) star for the small gap between the tables- I'm a petite gal, and had to SQUEEZE MY GLUTES extra hard just to get out with out touching the items on the table next to me.

This is my favorite Asian Fusion restaurants of all times. My favorite dish in this small restaurant is the seabass that is cook to perfectlion--70% cooked and 30% raw. It comes with string beans and garlic noodles. I tried the shitake mushroom soup one time and loved it but one have to call in advance to order it which is a hassle. I wish the mushroom soup would be place on the menu. I took off a star because I always feel rushed out of the restaurant. If you are dining with two or three people it is good but if you are dining with a group then it would be very uncomfortable.

It's been a while since I've been to The House. ÊThere use to be one on Irving and 9th back in the days and it closed down but they kept the one in North Beach open. ÊIt's a quarter of the size, teenie tiny, of the one that use to be on 9th but the food is still consistently good like I remember. My favorite has always been the Salmon Rolls. ÊDeep fried rolls of fresh salmon slightly rare on the inside. ÊI'm not sure what they put in it but damn they are so tasty. ÊThe wasabi dipping sauce is to die for...so good that I have to keep it to dip whatever I get from my entree in it! Also, is it me or have the portions gotten MUCH BIGGER? ÊYou would think in this economy, they would start to skimp on portions but I was up to my eyeballs in food when I left that place. The rib-eye was just as delicious as I rembered it and so was the seabass that I managed to get a few bites of. ÊThey had a special that night for an appetizer that was unforgettable...pork belly. ÊIf they ever have it when you go, definitely try it! The House will keep me coming back! It's obviously in one of the hardest locations to find parking but it's worth the few bucks for paid parking at one of the nearby lots. ÊMake a night of it, try checking out Beach Blanket Babylon after dinner...always good entertainment.

When I'm lost and can't figure out what to eat, the house is my safety net ... on the weekdays ofcourse to avoid the wait. I rarely ever make reservations since,"People know me". ÊBut, if you do have to wait, there is an really chill Mojito bar that has live music on somedays and the mojito are actually really good and they don't skimp on the mint. I stick w/ the safe bets unless there is a special that makes me salivate. I normally get the ribeye or the seabass w/ the salmon appetizer .... oh, and the Chimay beer. ÊDesert ain't my thang baby so you better ask someone else.

I made reservations at 9. Checked in at 8:45. I did not get seated for about 30 minutes b/c the party of 2 girls did not leave. But the host/server knew we waited for 30 minutes despite the reservation, he apologized and felt bad. Then an appetizer was provided on the house for my patience. I did not expect it but I had the Deep Fried Salmon Roll with chinese hot mustard. It was yummy. For appetizer, I had the Crab Cake and it was delicious. My main course involve Wasabi House Noodles with Flatiron Steak and it was my second time having it and it was awesome. My friend ordered the Sea Bass and she loved it. For dessert, we ordered the Creme Brulee and it was good. Not bad. Overall, my experience here is positive and I definitely would go back. Service and food were great. Best bet is to make reservations before coming.

It's good. ÊYes, there will be a line. Sure, the boozers from the Saloon next door are there for you to be amused by as they stumble by or stagger as they smoke. You should make reservations first. Been there a handful of times and every time it's been fun and good and a bit loud and we really, really enjoyed it.

BEST fish in the bay area. ÊGenerous portions of amazingly flavorful and juicy seafood; most other SF restaurants cook their fish too dry and/or plain. ÊBrace for mediocre service and a noisy, crowded interior; but that's what happens when you try to squeeze 50 ppl into the living room of a house.. ++ | Fried Salmon Rolls | Creative twist on the egg roll!! Seared salmon, wrapped in nori seaweed, battered, & fried to golden deliciousness. ++ | Grilled Sea Bass w/Garlic Ginger Soy | The buttery fish just melts in your mouth. Sensory overload. Enough said. ++ | Seared Yellowtail w/California Roll (Special) | Yellowtail is my standard for judging quality of fish, and I completely blown away. ÊIt's cooked perfectly - rare in the middle and seared lightly to lock in an extra punch of flavor. ++ | Pork Butt & Foie Gras (Special) | Foie Gras at an asian fusion restaurant??? YES! I was skeptical, but this came out better than I've tasted at french restaurants. ÊCross your fingers that this is on the specials board. -- Wasabi Noodles Tastes like.. stir-fried noodles. ÊC'mon, Chinatown is 2 blocks away to fill your noodle craving. EAT FISH AT HOUSE! -- Desserts Unimpressive. Pass for something more creative in North Beach. Reservations MANDATORY. you will not eat if you don't RSVP.

My third time back for my friend's birthday. ÊMy experience has downgraded to a three stars because the service by the waitress, although she appeared friendly, it was very rushed. ÊOur reservations were at 730pm and we waited about 5 minutes before being seated. The food I ordered (sea bass with miso glaze) was the special for the night. It was really good. Ê The dumplings and crabcakes - I did not care for but it was well decorated. Desserts- It did not look appealing so we passed.

This is my favorite restaurant. Therefore, it is only fitting that I write my first Yelp review for The House. I usually despise any thing that's "Asian Fusion," albeit I am an ABC. Asian Fusion usually translates to something cooked improperly and marinated with ginger, miso, soy, or sesame. So when my mom told me about this place, I had my doubts. However, The House breaks cultural barriers and the gastronomical taboo. Their version of Asian fusion is Asian ingredients cooked in a Western way, and served with Asian speediness. My favorite dish here is the pork chop. It has so many flavors! It's brined, with a sweet fruity sauce that's also tangy. It's Asian, it's American, it's everything! Make sure you listen to their specials list every time you go in, although the waiters/tresses have a tendency to stare at the wall while trying to remember what their specials are. The specials are fresh and tasty and usually better than what's already on the menu. Hits? The pork chop as mentioned, rib eye steak, soft shell crab appetizer, salmon skin roll, short rib pasta, oh the list goes on and on. I don't really love some of their fish dishes. I find them to be a little on the bland side. Their specialty is food on the grill. So stick to that and you're in good hands! You won't regret coming. :)

Definitely make a reservation. ÊIt was pack even for a Wednesday night. ÊWe were seated right away and the service was great. We ordered the crab cake which was good and was accompanied by a great sauce. ÊI had their special of hamachi and my friend had their halibut. ÊBoth fish were cooked perfectly. ÊThe halibut was softer compare to hamachi, but I enjoy the hamachi very much. ÊAs for dessert, we tried their mango tapioca, which was ok. ÊIt had a very strong cream layer on top. ÊFor this place, I can go without the dessert.

Awesome. Liang was the ideal server: warm, friendly and professional--as well as honest with us when we asked about whether bubbly shiraz was worth a try (then let us taste what he meant--and we agreed!). We heart him! The hostess accommodated us almost immediately, without reservations on a Saturday evening, and we appreciated her honesty when she let us know we had the table for ~75 min, before the reservation was due to arrive. Above all, the food was superlative, from the melt-in-your mouth sea bass/ sashimi combo, to the lightly battered scallop cesar salad, and ahhh, the surprising/ delightful warm kabocha squash tart drizzled with fresh cream and caramel--mouth-gasm! We'll be returning often for date night!

This is definitely one of my FAV restuarants! In fact, I didn't even know I liked seabass until I had it at the House. I didn't know that I ONLY like seabass from the House. After I had the seabass for the first time, I thought, okay, I like seabass. Then when I started ordering it elsewhere, it was NEVER the same... now I can ONLY have it at the House.... crazy right?? ...... But it's that good. The fish is buttery, flaky, Êand so delicous when dipped in the sauce. It's perfectly paired with green beans and noodles; the melody of flavors from all three blend so well together! One time I brought 3 girlfriends, when I sat down, I looked them straight in the eye and said "get your own, I'm not sharing".... and we did! =) Nuff about the bass, other things are good too! Appetizer must haves:The Salmon rolls and mussels are delish. Entrees that I would get if the seabass was somehow unavailable: 1) the Flat Iron Steak' 2) Mushroom rice with prawns 3) pork chops! (in that order too!!!) Noteworthy: Not a fan of the desserts make reservations great and friendly staff impossible to find parking, take a cab ENJOY

One of the best Asian Fusion places in the city. I've been here so many times, but never got around to writing a review. This place is cozy, so it gets packed fast. Even mid week, I would recommend calling in for a table before arriving, as you can end up looking for parking for 10-30 minutes, then having to wait for an hour. The food here is all around good, the Sea Bass and the Pork Chop being my favorites. The specials are always worth considering; when the butter-lettuce salad special is available, I'd definitely recommend trying it. The apps are great; the Salmon roll and oysters being delicious. Everything is good and worth trying! For service, I've always preferred Liang when he's working, as he has a great personality, fast and attentive service and knows just what to order if you can't make up your mind. The other servers are good too, but when you frequent a place, you'll always find someone you'd prefer. A place you should definitely hit up, again, I recommend reservations, especially if you want to go on a weekend!

Friend: Ê'Hey Ted, if you had to pick your #1 favorite restaurant in San Francisco what would it be'? Me: 'The House.' In my opinion you will not find more delicious, well prepared, well portioned and well priced food anywhere. Larry Tse and co. are the only ones doing asian fusion the right way in SF. Sure it's a term that died out in the 80's but the food at House is still as exciting as ever. It was my first meal (a lunch) when I arrived in SF almost 11 years ago and I still eat there. I've been enjoying the pork chop for over 10 years and it is still awesome...the lobster salad special is ridiculously good and I order it whenever it's available. Other faves are salmon rolls, the crab cake (whenever it's a special), and blue lake bean tempura. I had a steak special there one evening and it was the only restaurant dish I have ever had a dream about. I bring every out of town guest to House and it appeals to everyone and no one is ever disappointed (if they were they were lying!). What really puts House's food above the rest is that it's incredibly versatile without losing focus. Vegetarians have plenty of choices, as do the lactose intolerant or those who don't eat a lot of dairy or red meat, or those who need gluten free food -- everything is exploding with flavor, texture and contrast. About 5 years ago or so, I asked if Larry would ever consider releasing a cookbook and the answer was a definitive 'no.' Bummer. If you guys are reading this, please reconsider! Postscript: Just recently a friend asked, 'do you have any recommendations for some other places like the House? ' I thought for a second and said 'No. Just the House. That's it'.

I vastly enjoy weekend trips to San Francisco solely for the culinary prowess it beholds. On my list this weekend, The House. I had heard great things from a friend about this Asian inspired spot and quickly jotted it down on my to-eat list. For an appetizer I picked up a daily special which was a beef tartar with Fiji apples. Absolutely delicious and the presentation was superb. I had heard too much about the sea bass here to pass it up, so I went for it. Wow. Everything in this dish was fantastic. The noodles with cabbage mingled very well with the lightly cooked green beans. Don't get me started on the fish! It melts in your mouth and they serve a terrific sauce on the side (which you do not need although it is 110% delicious). This place knocked my taste buds' socks off and didn't leave a massive dent in my wallet. What more could you ask for?

This is the best Asian fusion restaurant I've eaten in San Francisco so far. Takeaways: - MAKE RESERVATIONS. It's very helpful that you do that beforehand. - The place is small relative to the crowd that tries to get in. With three people it felt small; proceed with caution with large groups (see previous point). - Steak here was well done AND the herbs/spices/sauces was a delight. - The price is a little steep, but you're getting your money's worth. The dishes were very filling, despite the modest portions.

7-stars! Ê7-stars!! This is my most favorite restaurant in SF. ÊI've been here through the last 3 years...I'd say 6-7 times now. ÊBeen here with small and large parties. If you're going to stop yourself from reading this lengthy, verbose review just know this. ÊMake no mistake. ÊThis place does everything well, unlike other restaurants which specialize in appetizers, killer desserts, awesome water!! They should just name their menu the "we-don't-disappoint", WDD you know. So this review is based on my last visit on a wonderful Monday night. ÊMade reservations to celebrate the gf's bday...only a 3-minute wait! ÊYay! ÊShout-out to DD!!!! Appetizers Crab Cakes - delicious. Êblissful. ÊSo much wonderful ingredients with green unions, green bell peppers, lots of mince crab, nicely fried on a crispy outside shell. ÊBe warned though, these are not individual crab cakes! ÊIt is one big blob that you'll have to cut up. Ahi Tuna - if you don't like raw tuna you should skip this one. ÊHint of wassabi with a bursting amount of cubed tuna on 4 chips. Ê greatness. Entree Sea Bass. ÊAs everyone says, get it, try it, laugh it, love it. ÊTasty dipping sauce, I wouldn't drench it though. ÊIt is fairly salty. ÊNice, creamy texture of bass but it still holds firm. ÊIt comes with some thick, round noodles and I believe a form of peas - not snow peas, it slips my mind right now... Pork Chops - wonderful love. ÊDrenched in pomegranate sauce. ÊPortion was just right. ÊServed with mashed potatoes and 4 pieces of grilled apparatus. Ê Dessert Chocolate,coffee cake with ice cream - this just topped it all off. ÊIt was only popping!! ÊWe also had a white dessert wine which tasted more like fresh lychees. Drinks Water - this even taste good. Êno joke. Wine - sparkling red bubbly. ÊI know that doesn't help, but it was good enough for me and paired well with all of the above Service - Great, explained things fairly clearly and made notes of preferences Restrooms - Clean; you wouldn't know but if they goofed this one it would automatically be -2 stars. Ambiance / Environment - Perfect night in N. Beach. ÊLoud, but not terribly loud. ÊPerhaps it was a monday night..because weekend nights are definitely more higher on the decibel levels. Ê - Only slight issue I had was sitting next to the door. ÊIt was a little chilly, but I just need to man up. ÊThe server did eventually close the door.

I like the atmosphere and how they value cleanliness and stuff. Sometimes, its in the little things they do, like clear the plates and tablecloths for dessert for a clean area. YUM!

This place is so highly hyped, especially on Yelp so I just had to try it. I was sorely disappointed, but I guess that's what happens when you hear about "the best restaurant in SF." We ordered the deep fried salmon skin roll, which was pretty good. However, it was so oily and greasy that I felt kind of gross eating it. I used to happily eat the fat off of meat, so that should give you an idea of how unhealthy the rolls tasted. I ordered the sea bass, which was indeed as tender and melt-in-your-mouth as other reviews had said. But then again, that's the texture of sea bass in general. If I'd just thrown a piece of sea bass in a pan and thrown oil on it, it would've had the same texture. The noodles on the side tasted so greasy, like they were from a cheap Chinese takeout place. I was grossed out and could only stand to eat a few strands. We also had the pomegranate pork chop which was mediocre. Meh. Not bad, not great. The only good part of the meal was the dessert, which was a coffee chocolate cake with ice cream. It was so soft and creamy, yet rich and decadent. It almost cancelled out the badness of the meal. Almost. But yeah...this place is way too overrated on Yelp.

Went here for lunch and all I have to say is WOW! ÊThis place knocked me off my chair. Ê To start we enjoyed these delicious spicy pickles and a side of deep fried salmon rolls. Although it was lunch time, I thoroughly enjoyed the delicious sea bass with amazing udon noodles and perfectly crispy string beans. The sea bass was made to perfection; crisp on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside! Ê As much as a glass of wine would top off the meal I went with their Lychee ice tea which was perfect. I wish I had more time for dessert, but I'll save that for my next adventure to N Beach.

I loved this restaurant so much I blogged about it! Please yelpers check it out here Êhttp://funfreshfab.blogsÉ I can't even believe that after over two years of living in the city, I had never dined in one of San Francisco's yummiest restaurants... The House. Well that was until last Friday, when I sat for two hours in amazement of how delicious the food was. I had always heard amazing reviews about this place from friends and yet for some reason, it was always put on the backburner. BAD decision! I am kicking myself for not trying this place out sooner. Now I know better than to stick to the "typical" restaurants and start venturing out to little places such as this that have so much to offer. So heres the lowdown on the restaurant: I'ts located in North Beach off of Columbus Avenue and food featured is Asian Fusion. It's a tiny little place so tables are limited and it's always packed. Reservations are a definite must and being on time is of utmost importance! I stress this because my friends and I have a bad habit of always being late to dinner. Usually we are able to weasel are way into letting this slide, but not here! So what are the best things to order? Well pretty much everyone that I had talked to prior, had recommended the sea bass. Which I have to agree was one of the most amazing dishes I have ever eaten! I also would recommend the tuna tartare for starters, although I hope you like wasabi because there's A LOT of it! I also could not stop stuffing my face (I know not cute) with the flank steak with wasabi noodles. Nom Nom Nom. I also tried the salad special for the night which was a papaya and steak salad... also excellent as well. Lastly, to finish up a perfect dinner...Warm apple pie with vanilla ice cream. I was in food heaven and still am after that meal! I highly recommend going if you haven't because you have been missing out! http://funfreshfab.blogsÉ

Why haven't I been here before?! I have to admit I had some reservations about this place, especially when restaurants are called "Asian Fusion." I was afraid this place would turn out to be some over-priced, fancier Asian restaurant. If I want GOOD Asian food, I could cross the street and go to Chinatown for cheap. It don't matter to me if the place looks a little dingy and there may (or may not) be rats running around in the back kitchen area. (Just kidding. I LOVE Chinatown!) Anyway, I was not disappointed. =) I ended up with a 9pm reservation for 4 on a Thursday night. We got there at about 850p and were seated in about 15 minutes. A couple came in after us without a reservation and the hostess/waitress told them it was a 1/2 hour wait. So, for sure, get a reservation so you won't have to wait too long. Our party of four decided to order a few dishes and share so we could all get a good taste of everything. It worked out perfectly. We ordered 2 small plates, the salmon roll (a must!) and the tuna tare tare (the heat from the wasabi sauce hit us up through the nose! But so worth it). And we ordered 3 main dishes. Everything was good and looking over to the other tables, everything LOOKED good! My favorite was the pomogranate pork chop. Perfect amount of sweetness in the sauce. We also ordered the creme brulee and the chocolate torte. The chocolate was my favorite. Another plus was that the total with tip came to $35 each! Definitely reasonably priced. I really wanted to try the scallop dish (not the caesar salad one) that people on yelp were raving about but it wasn't on the menu. =( Service was nothing special. Our waitress was nice but nothing to rave about. It didn't matter though. I left satisfied.

Not only is the food delectable, this place also does an excellent job of presenting the end results. The pork chop in a pomegranate sauce (the favorite at the table), the ahi tuna with spicy mustard aioli, and steak with passionfruit puree were all great, and the dessert (pear crisp, served a la mode - special for that day) was fingerlicking good. While they do accommodate vegetarians with some small plates, and will rustle up a custom order of noodles with tofu (quite tasty, and there are even a few sauces to choose from), it's not exactly a vegetarians' wonderland. The server was very gracious and did not rush us at all, even though we ended up staying almost 20 mins. past closing time.

After that they called me and said they can't take 8 people and he was very rude saying 'I told you we can't take more than 6 people'.

UPDATE - 05/14/07 I revisited The House very recently after a little hiatus and to my surprise, was a bit disappointed with this recent experience. The quality of service has not diminished, but I noticed that the wow factor in their food was absent. I took my fiance (The House virgin) here for his birthday along with our good friends (one who'd never been as well and the other who'd been once before awhile back). I kept it "traditional" in the sense that I suggested we ordered some of the "must haves." Our taste buds danced around with the deep-fried salmon roll, maine crab cake, wasabi noodles and angus steak, grilled sea bass, grilled ahi tuna, sole special and two bottles of wine (one red one white). The birthday boy also had the mango tapioca with port and sake. The ambiance was nice and the food was... fine. I can't explain it... I don't know what it was (or wasn't). We had a good time, but the food just wasn't as good as I'd remembered. My friend agreed with me on this too. Maybe I've just been spoiled with a slew of exceptionally good food lately... maybe I was just looking forward to the concert after dinner... or perhaps I wasn't hammered enough! JK. I'm turning my rating down a notch simply because... I feel that 4 stars reflects my current personal opinion on this restaurant more accurately than does 5 stars. Don't hit me ppl... I still want to be friends with The House... I think I've just fallen out of love with it, that's all. --------------------------------------------------?------------------------------ everything here is good. many things here are "sooo good!"

The House is a small Asian American fusion restaurant located between Chinatown and North Beach. I've visited their establishment Êmany times and the food is always good and consistent. This place is great for dinner dates as well as small groups. It can be on the noisy side but the food would make up for it. Great wine list and I wouldn't recommend lunches.

One of my favorite asian fusion places. Lunch-must try: Unagi Sandwich Dinner must try: deep fried salmon roll, unagi roll Prices are reasonable and service is good. It's not a huge restaurant though so it can feel a little bit cramped. Lots of cute shopping nearby :)

I used to go often when I was living literally around the block. ÊSo it was a pleasant surprise when my friend suggested going there for dinner. ÊIt's 9 pm Tuesday night and there were maybe 4 tables occupied. ÊScore! ÊNo waiting. Since I've had the super-yummy Sea Bass I decided to order the other white meat. ÊIt was moist inside and perfectly crunchy outside. ÊThe portion was generous. ÊMy only complaint was the bed of mashed potatoes where the Chef rests the scrumptious chicken was too smooth and flavorless. ÊI would preferred a bed of roasted veggies to give the chicken more substance. ÊIn fact, the waitress asked if I wanted to have a doggie-bag for the mashed. ÊUhhhh...No? My Friend ordered the Pasta special. ÊNo idea what it was. ÊSome kind of penne pasta with "fall-of-the-bone" stewed meat. ÊHe said it wasn't bad. ÊHe too would always get Fish but wanted to try something new. ÊI think he will probably stay clear of anything that is not Fish. Anyway wine by the glass was rather affordable - the *Shiraz* was a perfect pairing to the chicken. We skipped the dessert. ÊMaybe next time.

Quaint fusion restaurant that is very reasonably priced and not just another trendy fusion joint. Ê The House is small yet cozy and warm. ÊThere aren't a lot of tables so reservations are necessary (we had reservations). Ê This was a business dinner for 4 people, and with 1 bottle of wine, appetizers, entrees, and dessert, our bill was a mere $200 (before tip). ÊThat was refreshingly surprising. ÊAnd, the food was just lovely. I had the kurobota pork chop, which is the kobe beef of pork. ÊWow, it was like butta, baby. ÊGreat flavor (I think b/c of the marbling?) that just melts in your mouth. ÊMy colleagues had fish, beef...yikes, I can't remember. (Sorry, I should take notes immediately after my meals next time.) Anyway, I highly recommend The House.

On a recent Friday night visit, I had the mahi mahi special with calamari in a spicy miso broth (served with a side of rice) and split the tuna tartare appetizer with my dinner companions. Although the tartare was lackluster, the mahi mahi featured exciting and explosive flavors. Others at my table ordered the miso cod special, which came with a crab-avocado maki roll cut lengthwise and stretched over the top of the cod in what must be one of the most interesting plates I've ever seen. They certainly know how to cook and plate here. Unfortunately, they could learn a bit on how to manage the restaurant's flow. The place is small, and there isn't much of an indoors waiting area, which means that those who are itching for dinner end up spilling into the dining room. Near the end of our meal, good food led to animated conversation at our table (as good food tends to do); unfortunately, it seemed as if the bus boys, the waitress, and the hostess were colluding to have us kicked out as they constantly pestered us about eating faster, to the extent that it soured the dining experience. And that's really a shame, because they served some of the best food I've had in San Francisco.

We went there for my birthday. I must say I just loved what we had. We shared 3 apetizers, the seabass and had 2 deserts. That was too much, but all the dishes were truly excellent. We had the soup (daily special): creamy mushrooms with white truffle oil ; the dumplings and the deep-fried salmon roll, then the grilled seabass, the mango tapioca and the chocolate cake. Service was very professional, taking a lot of attention on the rythm of the meal. Highly recommended.

ÊWe ordered the pork shoulder and the miso glazed sea bass. ÊThe waitress was engaging and water glasses kept full. ÊEveryone in the restaurant seemed to be having a good time.

I can't believe there're so many 5 star reviews and I havn't heard about it until today! Word around the street is it's owned by the Slanted Door management. ÊHmm, quite a setup, wouldn't you say? Came here for lunch on a HOT sf afternoon. ÊThe restaurant is small and bustling with no A/C (why would you need it in SF), so I was stuffed and hot the whole time while there after walking under the sun for 15 min. to get there. ÊBut honestly, not their fault. Ê Food was DELICIOUS. ÊI had the warm wasabi noodles with salmon. ÊNoodles were flavored very nicely, the wasabi added just enough kick but definitely not overpowering. ÊThe salmon had the right amount of herb to give it a kick, and grilled just right with enough moist, tenderness and fattiness to my liking. ÊIt also came with some ginger/soy type cold veggies that complemented the dish perfectly. Ê I'll probably upgrade it to a 5 star when I try different things.

Mixed feelings about this place. Generally the food is good and interesting. Staff was really nice and REALLY quick. Food could have been better, especially given what you pay. Ambiance is sort of on the rushed and cramped side. I prefer more open spaces. Parking was heck too. I would be willing to try it again, but wasn't really impressed. I had the special with sea bass and a sushi roll laid over the top. Way way too much sauce on the bottom which is why I rated this mediocre. I feel like the sauce was being used to cover up the lack of quality in cooking the rest to perfection.

oOooookay. ÊSo I had dinner here with my BF on Sunday around 6:00pm. ÊWe didn't have reservations, but they sat us as soon as we came in. ÊLucky we came at the time we did, because within 20 minutes or so...the place was packed! ÊOn a Sunday!? Ê We decided to go with the mussels as our appetizer~ Mmm, they did not disappoint. ÊJuicy and seasoned perfectly. ÊI only wish I had some bread so I could have soaked up all the yummy sauce! I decided to go with the Sea Bass again. ÊHowever, I was a little disappointed. ÊThe Sea Bass was too salty. ÊThe BF's dish was SOO much better, I wanted to trade. The BF decided to try the pork chop with pomegranate sauce. ÊI don't think I've ever had such juicy pork. ÊSeriously. ÊIt was more tender than a fatty rib-eye. ÊHow do they do that???!! Ê Although the Sea Bass was a disappointment 2nd time around...the other 2 dishes were sooo wonderful.

So I'll start with the service, it seems a lot of yelpers had problems with it there. The service was great. We made reservations and were seated as soon as we walked in. The waitress was friendly and SMILED the entire night. I don't know, maybe she's new, but I can't really see this one being the waitress other people have described. Food: Maine crab cake. It was just ok. My date enjoyed it, but I prefer the crab cakes with lumpy, large portions of actual crab meat. Not the mixed/processed crab meat with filler. That's just me, we actually though it had a good portion for $10. Pork belly appetizer. Liked it very much. It reminds me of a traditional chinese dish. The fat to lean ratio was about 50/50, I guess that was a good thing. The pork belly dish I usually order is about 85 fat /15 lean and with skin. The sauce was good and the crispness of the lean meat put it over the top, very tasty. My main dish was the flatiron steak with wasabi noodles. I would not order it again. It wasn't a bad combination and the lady next to our table seem to have enjoyed it. The steak was cooked exactly as I asked, medium rare. I guess I just didn't dig the cut of the meat. I'm a porter and rib eye kinda guy. The noodles were ok, I ordered the dish because I like wasabi noodles, but I believe the noodles in this dish just had a wasabi flavored sauce. Maybe I'm crazy, but it taste different to me when the noodles have wasabi in them. My date ordered the pork chop, and wow! it was great. It was cooked perfect. Juicy and it had just enough fat around the meat and bone. The sauce was excellent, the only complain I have is it wasn't my main dish. I would not hesitate ordering the pork chop. On a side note, if I can do it all over, I would've gotten the black cod dinner special. The guy next to us ordered it and it look great. in all, I thought the food was pretty awesome, service was good. Price was very reasonable for what you were getting. Half of our bill was the wine. The only reason I would not go back is its location. I hate going to chinatown. you can claim north beach all you want, but a few steps from Broadway is chinatown to me.

Yay! I'm a fan. I love the pork in pomegranate sauce, black cod, and the seabass. We ordered scallop as appetizers too and it was scrumptious! They were pretty satisfying with generous portion. The ambiance was nice too, chill and homey - maybe that is "The House" came from. No wonder this place is crowded and hard to get reservation during dinner hour. I dropped my star down because it's crazily hard to get parking spot!

Overall a great restaurant, worthy of the high praise it has been getting on Yelp and elsewhere. Came here on a Monday night - the place was relatively packed - always a good sign. My delightful date picked up the bill, therefore my review is without prices (but I am not alone, rarely do people mention the fact that their experiences actually cost anything). Plus, their online menu is devoid of prices. Rant over, back to the food. We started with the deep fried salmon rolls - and yes, they were amazing. I seriously think this is the best version I have ever tasted. For the main course, I had the butterfish special. It was remarkable, and exactly what I was craving. My date had the sea bass, which came with a crapload of noodles. She couldn't finish it all. Wine selection was good - had a couple of reds from Napa/ Sonoma. Overall a restaurant not to be missed.

Local friends invited me to join them at The House on March 11, 2009, and I was so pleased by everything here. We were able to get a 6:30pm reservation so they weren't busy at all as we arrived (by the time we left at 9:00pm the place was jumping!). We sat in the front window, which I would suggest is the best place to sit with views out the window down Columbus out of North Beach. We had the scallops and flash fried salmon rolls for an appetizer. The scallop was perfectly cooked, and the salmon was great too. I am not a huge raw fish guy at all, but I devoured salmon which was warm and tender in the middle. We also tried their calamari. The sauce on the calamari was the perfect spice for the appetizer, and the rings were cut larger so the bites were more substantial than you'd expect. My buddy and I drank Duvel czech beer, which had a wonderfully heavier flavor than expected by color alone. Our lady friends had their Malbec. (NOTE: They only have 1 Malbec there, and you should skip it. Not good at all.) Our lady friends had their YellowTail, which was out of this world. My buddy had the pulled ribs, which looked great. I had the Pomegranate Porkchop, and if you're going and don't want to be too adventurous, then this is the way to go! Porkchop was perfectly flavored and cooked well. I get Creme Brulee whenever I can, so I tried this for dessert. It was a coconut creme w/a passion fruit sauce. The sauce was too bitter for me, and I didn't taste the coconut at all, but I have a soft spot for this dessert, and the consistency was perfect. This place feels like a small, homey restaurant, but as we move into the evening it becomes more kicking. By the time we left the line was out the door waiting for seats. Out waiter was wonderful. He knew the specials and was well versed on the wines. When asked about a certain meal, he told us how his wife loved it, and another he steered us away from. He was honest and truly wanted us to love our experience.

Well this place shouldn't be a secret to people... but I still thought I'd review it :^) Except for their limited bar... this place is a great place for dinner... in fact it used to be a place on my list of "where to take a date and not come off as a total cheeseball" You've got to realize, this is a SMALL restaurant. It's busy and hustle-bustley... but that adds to it's charm. Also, if your date, or you ask.... it's Asian fusion. Truly fusion... not Asian food for non-asian people fusion; but let's-make-something-tasty-by-combining-ingredient?s-and-techniques-from-different-cooking-styles-?locales fusion. Their sea bass... I'd call it a signature item... you really can't go wrong unless you vehemently against seafood. (in that case... don't worry... big Claude's got yer back... get the pork chops with the pomegranate currant sauce or the teriyaki rib-eye - - you will kind of be on your own for appies because I think almost all of them have seafood of some sort attached to it - - I consider "eel" to be seafood, though some people don't) Their specials list has always seemed good to me and I'll"ll usually try at least a new appetizer each time I go. Lastly, this place also cares about their food presentation... so the meals come out very well prepped! Hmmm... now I'm hungry again!

Came here for dinner during the weekend. Tried to make reservations the day of, but was told they were booked till 10pm but luckily was able to walk in and only wait about 20min for a table for two. All in all, probably one of the most interesting (and delicious) meals I've ever had. The sashimi appetizer was just so-so, but the wine was pretty good and the entree (I had the sea bass) was absolutely heavenly. Furthermore, the presentation alone gets an A+. My dinner companion ordered the prawn dish, I believe, and its prepared in such a way that it actually looks like the food is alive and moving! In reality, I'm pretty sure it was simply the thin onion skin reacting to the heat and pressure of the dish but it was awesome to look at nonetheless. Everyone definitely needs to try The House at least once.

And I've always had great service - even one night when I was with 3 friends and we were all very drunk from st. patty's, the waitress was still really nice to us even though we were being a bit obnoxious!

I went there on a Friday evening and was seated quickly with a reservation. Ordered a crab cake and miso mussel appetizers and they were excellent. For entree, we ordered their special butter fish, eel, wasabi noodle, steak to share. The entree dishes were in good amount of serving. We also ordered their persimmon and pumpkin cake dessert but they were so-so in my opinion. The wasabi noodle and steaks were okay but I've had better. I was really impressed with their seafood dishes and they were really good for the price given. I would say it's comparable to some of the fine dining I had. Here' s the price breakdown (since they don't have a menu online): Appetizer: 7-11 Seafood entree: 25-26 Non-seafood entree: 17-25 Dessert: 7-10 The bill came out to be $26 per person including tax and tips (didn't order alcohol). That's a really good price for the quality of food we had. Highly recommended their seafood dish and definitely should make a reservation before coming.

I've been there twice and I would recommend this place to anyone in a heart beat. Every single entree is amazing. My favorite is the sea bass. It was cooked to perfection and literally melted in your mouth. The prices trend a bit towards the more expensive side, but it's well worth it. The portions are pretty big. Ps - if you're planning on driving there, go early because it's insane trying to find parking.

This is such a great little place out in the north beach area. Its a little hidden out on a side street, sorta like an alley way. My boyfriend took me here for one of our anniversary dinners a while back and the place is pretty small, so make reservations and I suggest big parties to call way in advance. Most memorable dishes were, the fried soft shell crab and the kobe beef. These were specials so it probably won't be on the usual menu. I did however hear lots about the pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce and that was soooo good. The presentation was very nice and the pork chop was nice and thick, but still juicy inside. The house is well known for this so its a must try! Prices for the house isn't bad at all. Its reasonable priced, good food, nice presentation, and a cozy little place. Great for one of those special date nights! =)

If we are talking just food, this place is one of my absolute favorites in SF. I had the shrimp and chive dumplings as my starter and the garlic ginger soy sea bass as my main course... DELICIOUS. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I generally love Asian food but this is a very cool fusion style that makes it unique. Good sized portions too. I wouldn't say the ambiance is amazing - it felt a little cramped to me, and the noise level was a little high for dinner. So maybe not the best first-date type of place but go for the food!!! AMAZING!

Came here for my birthday a few weeks ago and let me tell you, it was a GREAT time! Had a reservation for a party of 5 on a Sunday evening around 7.. Got there 10 minutes early and had to wait outside in the rain for a bit (what else can you do though? The place is TINY!) though you could definitely have a drink next door if you need to. Sat down at our table near the middle which was pretty cramped for the 5 of us but not too bad.. It was to be expected 'cause well... THE PLACE IS TINY!! Probably would be best for smaller parties of 4 or a date for two. Ordered appetizers: White shrimp and Chinese chive dumplings - cooked well, not gummy whatsoever but pretty bland and boring. Deep-fried oyster w/ baby arugula salad - cooked perfectly, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Grilled calamari in tomato sauce - special of the night. Delicious. Not much else to say haha! Deep-fried salmon roll w/ Chinese hot mustard - crunchy and yummy, went well with the hot mustard. Our party had an assortment of drinks as well but I can only review what I had - Black Tea with Lychee! Well for starters I love black tea and I love lychee, so this really couldn't go wrong for me. If you can't handle unsweetened teas however, they provide some natural sugar (yay) and sweet 'n low (eew) packets for you. I usually put one packet of the good stuff in mine. It was refreshing PLUS you got the most awesome tasty ending - a ball of lychee. YUMMM. For dinner we had different plates all around that included the sea bass (my plate) and the pork chop with pomegranate sauce which I also got to try. Ok let me stop for a second here and just say that my sea bass was the most delicious, succulent, mouth-watering, juicy, melt-in-my-mouth piece of fish I have EVER tasted!! It was truly amazing. I was pretty much in sea bass heaven. I couldn't even speak much whilst enjoying my sea bass because of the pure bliss. I kept thinking to myself "what an amazing birthday present". SERIOUSLY!! The garlic noodles with it, also yuummmyy. My only gripe: the garlic ginger soy wasn't even needed! It was quite strong so only use a small amount if you do, but the fish is wonderful on its own. The pork chop - also amazing! Soo juicy on the inside, nice grill on the outside. The pomegranate sauce with some blueberries thrown in was a great addition and didn't try to mask the beautiful flavor of the meat at all. After all those appetizers, huge dinners, drinks... Yea, we had dessert too. AYE! IT WAS MY FUGGIN BIRTHDAY YO! For dessert we ordered: Passion fruit creme brulee - Good, but the passion fruit flavor was STRONG. HELLA STRONG. Wow. But good if you like that sort of thing. Blueberry bread pudding w/ vanilla ice cream - Delish! I love bread puddings so this was a great end to the meal. Plus I got a little surprise candle and a happy birthday tune sung to me at the table. Embarrassing? Hell no I love that stuff! Needless to say we had an amazing time and everyone enjoyed their meals. The portions were HUGE which is kind of unexpected these days (but in my opinion, who cares hahah) and cooked beautifully as well as presented immaculately. Service was a little on the slow side but it was a pretty busy evening so with the good company I barely noticed.

Dining around San Francisco is a little problematic since there are so many restaurants and so little stomach room! ÊWith that said, my boyfriend and I wanted to try The House because of the incredible reviews, so rather than order an entree each we opted to share a light lunch of the Tuna BLT with a side salad ...our only mistake, sharing! ÊAfter we were done with this incredible sandwich we wanted another one immediately! The seared tuna is slice and layered on a bed of bacon, lettuce, and tomato (duh, that would be a BLT) but whats so special is the slight touch of heat from the creamy wasabi mayo...amazing. ÊThe salad was perfect, dressed with a wonderfully light miso vinaigrette. ÊA faultless light lunch...if a simple sandwich at The House is that good, can't wait to go back and see what else they have to offer!

Oh, how I love thee. So two of my friends were here apartment hunting before their big move from NYC. "Pick a restaurant, Meghan!" they say. Whew...pressure. Where did I turn? To my lovely Yelpers. And you did not steer me wrong. While the decor/ambiance is maybe a bit lacking the food and service most certainly were not. Sea Bass = heaven in the mouth. SOMEONE in your group must order it. We ordered two appetizers, three entrees, drinks and dessert. Every. Single. Dish. Was. Amazing. Had the best scallops of my life thus far (were a featured app of the day). I now recommend The House to any visitors and can't wait to have my best friend visit in a month so I can introduce him to this awesome place. Oh...and did I mention the food is amazing but doesn't break the bank? For three of us to have drinks, share two appetizers, three entrees and dessert we all payed $60, which included the tip. We went all out because we were in a celebratory mood, but you certainly could have an amazing meal here for under $40. So kids, take it The House. (Yep..thats right, I said it.)

One of the most under rated restaurants in SF by far. ÊEvery time I have been here I've had a fantastic dining experience from the food to the service. ÊAlways consistently fabulous! ÊAnything you get you will be satisfied, however here are some of my favorites: Starters: - Maine crab cake with pickled ginger remoulade - Ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips - Classic fried calamari Entrees: - Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak - Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy - Grilled ahi tuna (rare) with spicy mustard aioli - Angus ribeye steak, housemade teriyaki, toasted garlic butter They also have a big selection of daily specials, that wont steer you wrong!

We took a chance of not having a reservation and went for it. ÊAlthough we ended up waiting for almost 30 minutes, we got seated at about 8:30. ÊThere were a few tables where the reservations were a no show, lucky for us! The waitress seemed a little stress out but she was still friendly and polite. ÊWe sat next to the entrance so we got the gush of cold air whenever the door opened. ÊThe food came out promptly despite it being a full house. ÊMy friend ordered the pork chops, I ordered their steak and my other friend had a couple of appetizers. Ê The food was absolutely delicious! ÊThe pork chops were cooked nicely with no dry spots around the edges (I hate that) and perfectly glazed with a delicious sauce. ÊMy steak was perfectly cooked to my temperature of Med-Rare. ÊIt was slightly crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside, perfect! ÊThe appetizers were nicely presented also tasted good. Ê This would've been an easy 5-stars but the staff seem short-handed and rushed. ÊBut they did do a great job with the amount of people in the restaurant. ÊI would definitely visit this place again. ÊThank you Yelp for the suggestion!

Came here for dinner the other night I have to say, the food here is absolutely worth the 1.5 hour wait!! At first I thought "Asian fusion...ehhh" but with 4.5 stars and 1300 reviews, this place had to be good. Here's what we ordered: Seared scallop appetizer - tastefully seared just right so the outside while the inside soft and savory. Grilled ahi tuna with spicy mustard aioli - loved the presentation of this dish when I first saw it. The slightly seared tuna along with the spicy mustard and green sauce was a perfect combo. Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy - !!!! do get this dish if you plan on eating here! This had to be the most amazing sea bass I've ever had. Perfectly seasoned and the sea bass just melted in your mouth. An A+ dish (though the side noodles and veggies weren't especially memorable) Angus ribeye steak, housemade teriyaki, toasted garlic butter - another excellent dish. Usually I'm too much of a fan of teriyaki sauce, but the chefs here did it right. Chocolate cake - after 4 delicious plates, I could not wait for dessert. The House's Chocolate cake however was quite a disappointment. The cake was overly sweet and rich for my taste. Would not recommend if you do not prefer your desserts too sweet (picky Asian palate concept). In conclusion I highly recommend this place to anybody seeking some legit asian fusion while in the city. I would suggest making reservations to avoid the long wait as this restaurant is pretty small. However, we had quite an enjoyable time during our wait as there are many bars and stores open around the North Beach area; we simply relaxed at a snazzy wine bar a couple of blocks down and we received a call when our table was ready. Next time I will for sure try that Miso Cod... 4.5/5 stars (even with the less than memorable dessert).

I don't give out 5's real easily, but this one is for 12+ years of eating at the house and getting blown away every time. ÊIf you need to bring another couple/your inlaws/possible swingers it's a great place. Êintimate, yet open enough to not have to whisper. Êsmall enough to get good attention from your server. ÊI miss his old set up in the USD, but that was too big of a space. I hope to be eating here for another 12 years. Ê The Ahi Tuna is my #1 go-to.

O. K. Read lots of reviews. Mostly the bad ones, what's the worst that can happen, right? (-: Best meal/dining experience I've had since being introducted to Gary Danko's 10 years ago. Many reviews show Angela, one of the owners show her as a shrew. We got started off on a wrong foot, and it was my fault, but she was a connsumate professional, and a warm and lovely young lady at the same time. We were invited to dinner by friends. They told us they had been told, etc., ad infinum, word of mouth advertising, about 'the house', and wanted us to join them. (Made the reservations 3 weeks early.) I forgot who invited who, so I called Angela and we spoke on the phone 3 times withing 30 minutes trying to figure it out. We figured it out, and thank you Angela for putting up with us. The kicker was that the day before we had to cancel the reservation, Horror customer, right? (-: We rescheduled for Saturday, October 16, 2011 7:00 p.m. Back to the horrid reviews. (Evil Grin). Lot's of the bad reviews complain about not getting instant seating like you would at McDonalds. Hey! It's a hip, trendy restaurant in the beating heart of North Beach, and within eyeshot of the Stinking Rose. (I've still got to get there.) We arrived 15 minutes early and I checked in for the reservation. We were told there would be about a 15 minute wait. (Remember. EVERY table was already full and people were eating and more waiting.) (And it was so "small" inside) (-: We stood outside the entrance. It was a beautiful night. As we waited for our friends, we listened to live music coming from the Saloon next door, across the alley. It was bright colorful, entertaining, AND everytime Angela came to the door to greet new customers, she always caught my eye with a reassuring nod to let me know she hadn't forgotten about us. We still, offically, weren't even in the door and I was having a great time. We were playing phone tag with our firends who were driving around looking for a parking spot. Did pretty good. They were only 5 minutes late, and we hadn't been seated, yet. It's all street parking, so come 45 minutes early to make sure you can find a space. It costs $20.00 in some of the open lots, but it's well worth the convenience. Walk the neighborhood for a bit if you have the time. It's a great walk, even for just a few blocks. At 7, we still hadn't been seated, but neither had anyone else, and we were having fun just schmoozing around. About 15 minutes later, Angela came to the door and called us. I think we got the best table in the restaurant. As you enter, left side, last table for 4 before the kitchen wall. And from there it began......and continued.......and Wow! There were so many amazing offerings in the appetizers, we had to order 2 each, total 8, and a general one to share. We shared them all and each was better than the one before. It didn't matter what we ordered. Don't let me start on the presentations. You've got to see them for yourself. The table next to us had their main courses serverd just as we were ordering. We didn't get a good shot at the menu. We just ordered what the table next to us had. (It doesn't matter what you order. You will never have had anything like it before.) Deserts were simple, traditional, for the most part (-: , and made of the finest quality ingredients that you could tase in every bite. The wait staff was attentive, polite, helpful, fast (even more so that we had expected. Thats a good thing.), and were responsible for the throughly enjoyable time we had. Thank you Angela, and your partner and your staff. It was really wonderful. Go. Don't be in a hurry. Enjoy a really rare dining experience.

We went here last night for a date. It was extremely busy and despite having a reservation (and arriving 10 minutes after the scheduled time) we waited about 15 minutes for a table. The service here is very attentive and professional, taking their time to answer all of our questions about the specials for that night. I had the Kobe special, which was somehow had a little too much fat for me, and my date got the pork chops that were DIVINE. These were juicy and moist and it melted in my mouth. I'm definitely a fan and will be coming here again in the future.

Kinda Japanese-European... just amazing flavors with swirls of innovative sauces... lots of seafood.

I'm sorry it's taken me this long to write a Yelp review on House restaurant. ÊI've been a patron for years and it's my favorite restaurant to recommend (I'm a concierge in SF). ÊI've had almost every fabulous item on the menu, but usually get the sea bass or a fish special. ÊOnce a friend ordered the Mushroom Rice with Grilled Prawns. ÊI'm not a particular fan of either white rice or prawns, and it would probably be the last thing on a menu I would order. ÊBut I gotta tell you, I thought I died and went to heaven, finishing my friend's dish. ÊHouse is nothing fancy, but not a dive. ÊYes, parking is difficult and the small space and closely arranged tables afford little privacy, but whenever I order fish anywhere else, I am sadly disappointed because no restaurant can match the quality and taste of the fish dishes House, as well as all the other outstanding menu items.

I finally got the chance to eat the the house, and just as I expected, I loved loved loved the place. We had reservations for 8:00pm, and was seated promptly. The place is small and dimly lit, giving an intimate atmosphere. We ordered the Ahi Tuna served with Mustard Aioli and the Kurobuta Pork Chop with Pomegranate Currant Sauce. The food was amazing, and all the different elements in the plate just blended so well together. For dessert, we had the Coconut Crme BržlŽe with Passionfruit Puree. It was made perfectly, and the portion was generous, just right for two to share. As seating is pretty tight, and the couple next to us was having a heated argument, it made things a little uncomfortable for a while. However, once the food came, I was so immersed into enjoying the food, their loud bickering became muffled amongst my satisfaction. I also caught a glimpse of the sea bass, it smelt really good, and is definitely on my list to try next time. All in all, it was a fantastic experience and I'm definitely going to come back to The House many more times.

I've been coming to this joint since my younger years, Êstill does not cease to amaze me what Chef Tse does in the kitchen! ÊThere is no words to describe my fancy to this place. I'm pretty solid to my orders when I come to the House... Êthe menu is good, stick with it; specials are good too, but if you are a first timer don't miss out on what the original favorites.

Tight, Rocking, Loud. The Dinner Experience. This place is cramped. So cramped its a joke. ÊIts loud in here. Room is tight, people with babies, tables spaced a foot apart. ÊWaiters and Food Runners butts and arms in your face all night long. ÊMy biggest irk had hit me upon seating. ÊOur table unfortunately, was rocking harder than our "Rock Band" game at home. ÊDon't these people check tables for movement? ÊUncomfortable. ÊAlmost like dining in an airplane. Specials. ÊThere were 7 that night. ÊSo confusing that even the waitress couldn't remember them. ÊNow, I love it when servers announce specials, but this was ridiculous. ÊEvery table that sat down had to go through the repetitive process of the announcement. ÊAnd with such tight quarters, you'll be hearing specials all night long. ÊEvery single table was clueless on what was on the special. ÊI think they should've printed it on paper, and just announce one or two specials. ÊThey already have the slip inserts on their menus. ÊA "specials" board would help too. ÊIt would've save the customers a headache, and the waitress time and prevent mistakes from screwing up the specials; as she announced something that wasn't on the menu and a customer had ordered it. ÊOpps! The Food The food is tasty. The crab cakes however is not your typical crab cake. ÊIts more like a crab volcano that went into a deep fried jacuzzi. If you're the meaty type crab cake lover, you'll have to look else where; maybe down at the wharf. ÊExpect an almost like pureed consistency, with the bits of acidic crunch that dominate the chew. ÊThe remoulade was quite tasty, especially with the black tobiko. ÊThe grilled scallions were a nice addition, even though they were cold. The Tempura Green Beans were also tasty. ÊHowever the dipping unit could've used some more depth and maybe stay uncovered, instead of being a hidden treasure through the mesh dome of green beans. The delicate misoyaki black cod was cooked perfectly. ÊI, however believe that if a piece of beautiful fish is served with the skin on, it should be presented with the skin on top, crispy. ÊThe veg and sauce worked great with the dish, but the flavor of the miso in the fish was lacking. ÊMaybe with the skin off and a longer marinade, then fish would have that penatrated miso flavor as the fish melts in your mouth. ÊThe open faced California roll didn't belong in the dish. ÊThe roll was sloppy, rice was mushy, and the Avocado pretty much took center stage. The Chilean Sea Bass was an excellent dish. ÊAs expected, the meaty charred flavor of the bass exuded its high oil content in the mouth with every chew. ÊThere was no need for the sauce on the side as the fish itself was perfect alone. The chow udon was great and the string beans worked very well. ÊA great dish. I couldn't help but look over at the other tables sloppy nigiri. Bottom line. ÊThe food is good. It's tasty. ÊIt's cooked perfectly and comes out at a good time. ÊI'm picky about my stuff, cause I know my food. ÊThe service was ok, nothing thats gonna want to bring me back. ÊIf you like eating pricey dishes with the cramped feeling of being sardines, Êeavesdropping and making friends with your neighbors, this is your place. ÊLooking at my girl uncomfortably smashed between two big people reminds me of KFC quality chickens force-fed in a coop.

I went here for lunch on a saturday right before it opened. To my surprise there was a couple already seated in the front right next to the door. Initially I was supposed to have lunch with an old friend but she bailed on me last minute so I asked my other friend if she wanted to go and i'm so happy she agreed. I ordered the sea bass while my friend ordered the short ribs. Both were delicious!!! The sea bass was HUGE and was plated over a generous amount of green beans and noodles. Like other reviewers, the sea bass practically melted in your mouth! As for the short ribs, they were also tasty and had generous side portions. I basically licked the plate clean and was extremely satisfied with my meal. Even though the sea bass cost the most out of the rest of the menu I thought it was worth it for the taste and serving size. Also, I thought the service was excellent. 5 stars! :) I will be back to try other dishes

Everyone raves about the tv show, "House," on Fox, but I find the doctor slightly annoying. ÊHowever, I am a BIG fan of this House, though I often find my table neighbors here as annoying as that doctor. But I digress...for all my fellow foodies, this place is a destination you have to try just once. ÊSure, the tables are tight and you'll get hit about half the amount of times your fork reaches your mouth and your neighbors will obviously be listening to your conversations because there is no where else for their ears to go, but the food is so worth it. Some MVP's: - lobster tempura salad with masago and a creamy dressing - Wagyu beef in a bbq sauce (special right now) - Kurobuta pork chop (sometimes they have Niman) with a pomegranate and currant sauce: my absolute favorite pork dish of all time. ÊThe meat is always cooked to a perfect medium, and the flesh is succulent paired with the rich and fruity sauce. ÊYummy yummy in my tummy good.

I had a fantastic meal here for my friend's 21st birthday. The service was attentive and prompt, and the food was great. I had the ahi tuna which was cooked perfectly and the plating was lovely. My boyfriend had the salmon and the sake broth was wonderful. The shrimp broth that came with the mussels appetizer was to die for, and I was only sad that there wasn't any bread to soak it up in. The prices were what you'd expect of a nouveau-haute cuisine-yuppie-ish place, which is to say it's not cheap, but it ain't gonna break the bank either. Two appetizers, five entrees, drinks, and dessert for five was about $165 pre-tips. The wine is a bit pricey in my opinion, but they have a pretty decent selection. My only complaints? The place is really small, so the five of us were packed into a table that barely comfortably fits four. Also, the parking in the area sucks, which isn't the restaurant's fault, but definitely affects whether I'd want to schlep down there and fight for parking for a meal.

Went there one night with a couple friends because we heard so many great things about this place. Let me say, everything we heard was right. We started with the fried chicken liver and pork belly...both were super good (note:never had liver in my life!) then we went on to our entrees....and OMG....it felt like the angel of food and savor hugged each dish before it left the kitchen. The food looks like artwork, at first you're like, I don't want to ruin it, but then the smell captivates you and you nosh right in. I had the sea bass, which was the equivilent of steak, but fish. It was juicy, thick, and flavorful. My boyfriend had the pomegranate pork chops....wow...i mean...wow. So flavorful and HUGE portions! My friends had the halibut (generous portion, great flavor) and also the flat iron steak over wasabi noodles. Okay, can I just talk about the wasabi noodles for a minute....I have never tasted anything like that. I had the garlic noodles with my plate, STILL GOOD, but OH-MYLANTA...my friend and I were asking the waitress if we could order a side of the wasabi noodles to go...I said I would pay whatever! Unfortunatley, we coulndn't...a girl can dream can't she? We ended our night with desserts...the chocolate something or other cake....very rich and smooth like velvet, my bf got the apple dish, YUMMY the apples were thick and crispy. I got the creme brulee....now I am a HUGE creme brulee fan, and the quality of the brulee was great, but they kind of messed it up by putting this passion fuit sryup over it. It was wayyyyy to tart and threw everything off. So if you order the creme brulee, I recommend sans the passion fruit syrup crap. The reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is the location. It's smack dab in the middle of north beach, so no parking. And also because even though we had reservations, we had to wait a while to be seated. Other than that...I look forward to my next meal at this hidden jewel!

One of my favorite restaurants in all of San Francisco; it's danergous living down the street from this joint. Their dishes are creative and amazingly tasty. ÊLast night we had the seared Hamachi with avacodo roll, the sea bass, the sirloin steak, the Roasted Unagi and crab cake. ÊI tasted each of these dishes and they were cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. ÊThe chef pays great attention to detail carefully constructing the presentation of each dish and has a special knack for bringing out the best flavor and fishes in the seafood he cooks. ÊThe portion sizes are just the right amount and the entres are always well paired with a good choice of veggies. The House will always be one of the top restaurants I recommend!

My FAVORITE place to eat. I always come here fully satisfied and I get my money's worth. My favorite dish has to be the salmon rolls. They are so orgasmic. I could eat those everyday and wouldn't care if I got fat. They are delicious! The only con about this place is that the space is quite small and when this place is packed, it can get a little crowded. The tables are positioned very close to each other. You can hear other diners' conversations! This place can get pricey, but sooo worth it. Definitely check it out.

The House is a small restaurant offering asian fusion cuisine. It gets pretty crowded so I would suggest making a reservation. There were some people that were walk-ins and I overheard the wait time being around an hour. The service varies on who you get. The guy who set up our table didn't even acknowledge us. He just put down the menus and walked away. The guy who took our order was more attentive. As for the food, we ordered 2 appetizers: deep fried chicken liver with greens and mussels. I loved both but I was a little disappointed in the mussels, only because a lot of the mussels meat were out of the shell so it seemed like we were given a plate of empty shells. For our entrees, we ordered: the wasabi noodles with steak and kurobuta pork. The noodles were fantastic, clearly the star of the dish with the steak being just a topping. I loved the pork as well.. very tender and the pomegranate glaze went really well! Even though we were pretty much stuffed, we decided to get dessert. I mean, come on, how can I say no to creme brulee? We also ordered the persimmon bread pudding special that night, which was awesome! It reminded me of pumpkin pie.. yummm!!!

It's been a few months since moving to Telegraph Hill, and I've passed by this joint on Grant probably hundreds of times. ÊThe storefront is rather nondescript, especially given the neighboring dive bars and strip clubs. ÊFortunately, hubby noticed the place and wanted to give it a try. ÊWe were lucky to get a table with limited wait on a Saturday night. ÊThe interior is pretty much similar to the exterior--simple, clean lines, and, at most, hinting at the type of cuisine offered. After sitting, the server informed us of the specials, which all sounded fabulous. ÊUltimately, we got the special clams, the eel roll, wasabi noodles with steak, and a special Hawaiian sampler plate. ÊService was quick and friendly, with our apps arriving in short order. ÊThe eel roll was pretty good. ÊThe clams were amazing. ÊThe broth was just a tad spicy, and tasted great with the grilled pieces of bread served with the app. ÊThe dinner entrees were equally fabulous, with the wasabi noodles being the hit of our evening. I didn't have room for dessert, so I guess I'll have to hit up the House next time!

This is one of my all time favorite restaurants, and the first one I'd think of when I have visitors from out of town. ÊIt's located on the edge of Little Italy and Chinatown, which makes it the perfect dinner location after a day of sightseeing. ÊThe small cozy atmosphere also makes it very easy for a great conversation. Ê I've been here enough to have tried many of their dishes, and so far not a single dish has disappointed me. ÊThe best of the best comes from their specials. ÊI still remember trying their steak cooked with miso and how the steak melted in my mouth like butter. ÊIt was like in the cartoons when they try good food, fireworks come out of no where in the background. ÊYes, that's exactly how I felt when I tried that steak.

WOW - hands down it was one of the most amazing dining experiences I have ever had. I went on a Friday night and it was packed. Even with a reservation we had to wait a good 20 minutes. Well worth the wait I must say... We ate: the Selected Oysters on the Half Shell, Scallops, Braised Pork, and the Mushroom Rice with Grilled Prawns. ALL AMAZING!! The chef truly put me through a journey of senses through each course. Presentation was simple, stellar. I savored each bite and often found myself trying to scrape every bit of goodness off each plate. The service was genuine. I can't wait to go back!

Not perfect things first: - the place is a bit on the small side, only a few tables along a hallway shaped room, but it could be seen as cozy too, perfect for small parties, defintely make a reservation first - street parking is pretty hard, but there is a garage on stockton and vallejo st, does not validate tho :( Everything else is perfect :) - for appetizer, we got the salmon roll w/ chinese hot mustard sauce, was quite wasabi-y and crunchy - we got two entrees, grilled sea bass with garlic ginger & kobe beef steak, mmmmmmmmmmmmm =9 - service is very friendly, speed & portion are very good too

Finally got to try this place! Definitely worth the wait and the price, which was justified. I had the wasabi noodles with angus skillet steak. The noodles were very good with enough of a wasabi flavor to it, which was just right. The salmon tasted normal to me, but I'm not a connoisseur of seafood. Their special menu included kobe beef and an appetizer with pork belly, but that was beyond my budget that night. The portions were just right too - not bulky yet fulfilling. For a restaurant that I've been eager to try after seeing it on Episode 13 of Check Please! but never got to go, this place fulfilled my expectations! It also had a very cozy feeling to it as again meeting expectations. The tables were close together, the pictures on the wall made it feel like home, and the soft colors set the mood inside and out. It was a place I wanted to go, a house, like home.

Even with it tucked away in the corner of Grant and Columbus, "The House" is hard to miss. It's super busy and if you don't have a reservation, you might not get lucky in eating the food that night. We started off with appetizer specials that were recommended by our server. They were really tasty. Then we each got our entrees and at first were a bit disappointed in the portions of them. The presentation was phenomenal, but we were skeptical about the portions being able to fill us up. Boy were we surprised when at the end of the meal, we were happily satisfied. What was even more satisfying was the dessert afterwards. Our server had a few recommendations for our dessert, and we decided to just try 3 different ones each. We were not disappointed. The check came out to about $55/person. Don't get it twisted, this place is not cheap, but in my opinion, well worth the money for any special occasion type of dining.

Hands down one of my favorite places in SF. ÊThe food is very creative, super tasty, and the service is extremely good (which is surprising given how they are so busy and popular). Ê Great for a date (b/c most dishes are good to share with 2, but no more than 2... and it's in a colorful part of town). Favorite dishes: - Soft shell crab app (the dipping sauce is sweet and spicy, and great on every other dish... maybe not) - Unagi with avacado rice (very neat - I tried to make it at home... not as good) - Warm wasabi noodles - a must, I think there may be addictive properties in this thing (it's a dry noodle with beef and veggies and some amazing sauce)

Ahh The House...with the nearly 1600 reviews of this place I figure anything I'd have to say would be merely repetitive and then some... Ordered: Seared Scallops- carmelized scallops w/a light mango citrus sauce, on special that night, fresh and tender, my only complaint would be that it came with 3 scallops which seemed a bit awkward given most people come to this type of restaurant in pairs hoping to share with their companion... Wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak- so daddy taught me never to order noodles at a nice restaurant, "Who in their right mind pays for overpriced noodles?!" (read in a thick Persian accent)...but the raving reviews and promise of steak were enticing enough to ignore these vital life lessons....as expected this was a very flavorful dish with a dash of Wasabi that was not too overpowering..steak was not bad, could tell that it was not the main focus of the dish, and the noodles were a bit too thick for my taste, great 'fusion' style dish to try but I think I'll take dad's advice next time... Grilled Sea Bass with Garlic Ginger Soy- now this was by far the highlight of the meal, cooked to a perfect temperature (make sure to eat quickly before it cools) for melt-in-your mouth deliciousness, side dishes of garlic noodles and snap-peas also paired well with the fish, would come back for this solely to re-order... Coconut Creme Brulee with the Passion Fruit Puree- portion size was good, creme brulee itself was not bad, the temperature seemed a little off for me and I've had better, only a slight undertone of coconut yet a distinct sour passion fruit taste, which was nice.... Atmosphere: Service was pretty inattentive that night, my attempt to flag down a server for salt and a drink refill took so long that my food had completely cooled...quite a small space for such a popular restaurant, tables were so close together that it was as if you're sitting in your school cafeteria...other than that the ambiance was good.... Overall, definitely recommendable!!

Everything was very well done there. From the service, to the presentation to the intimate yet lively atmosphere, to of course the food. They had a great assortment of food to choose from. Reasonably large portions with great flavors in every bite. One can go from sweetness to gingery spiciness in a single bite. I tried the bass, the crab cakes, the salmon roll ~ each one was just divine. The service was very friendly and unpretensious. The restarant was very small so you definitely need to make reservations in advance. You can bring your own bottle of wine too but they have a long list to choose from. I would definitely go back when I'm in SF.

Understated, casual, interesting and a wonderful price point. I was more than pleasantly surprised with this restaurant. Some of the fusion dishes, particularly the fried salmon roll with what appeared to be mustard, was something I had never experienced. The mussels, tuna tartare and dumplings were also well executed but certainly not unique to my dining experience. The appetizers/small plates on the whole appeared to more exciting to me the entrees of sea bass (good) and flat iron steak (above average). The wasabi flavor to the noodles that accompanied the steak was barely perceptible and certainly I would have appreciated a robust influence of the wasabi. Total cost for three people with a few beers thrown in was around $120. This is definitely a restaurant worth returning to and I would certainly explore the remaining small plates and appetizers.

I don't know where they got that pic but that's NOT what the place looks like - it's a shoebox! Although I do have to say that this is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The food isn't pretentious and they give you pretty good sized portions. Prices are great for what you get. They need to reopen their old location on 9th Avenue - three times as large, though less parking. At least with their North Beach location you have the parking garages and Steps of Rome right there. Favorites: the roast chicken with mashed potatoes, Niman Ranch pork chop, and (when they have it) the butterfish. Mmm mm good! Desserts not so great but that's what Steps of Rome is for.

Just got back from House and as part of my new commitment to Yelp I will actually write a review. Looking at the menu online I wasn't quite sure - I don't eat shrimp and there was a lot of it on the menu. Ê ÊThankfully I was with three other people and had plenty of opportunity to share. My personal order: ÊCrab cakes, Sea bass, Strawberry upside down cake, oolong tea, pinot gris. Nothing failed for me tonight. Ê The crab cakes (in no way can it be construed as "cakes") were delicious, if not a great "shared plate". Ê Sea bass was incredible. Ê Through "grilling" (seemed like it was broiled), it had great caramelized edges, almost similar to scallops. Ê The hearty portion of shanghai style noodles and green beans is a nice compliment. Ê ÊUpside down cake was warm and delicious. Other items I sampled: Wasabi noodles and flatiron steak - 3 stars Domestic kobe skirt steak (special) - 3.5 stars - The sauce didn't do it for me Teriyaki rib-eye - 4 stars - Great cut of beef and well seasoned Tempura salmon app - 3.5 stars - Great "clear your sinuses" sauce I can see the menu getting stale after a while, but for a few special occasions this place is spot on. Ê Great drink selection to boot! You can't beat a nice dinner at House washed down with creepy memories of 50+ singles grinding on each other at the Saloon next door...priceless

Came here after a friend's recommendation and was greatly satisfied by the menu. ÊWe all ordered different items and tasted each other's dishes, and every plate was delicious. ÊFrom sea bass, to Korean ribs, to steak with house noodles, and to the pork chop, all were perfect in serving portion and great in taste. Ê The restaurant is really small, so make a reservation in advance.

Very disappointing. I've heard good things about this place. But after trying many dishes - my overall feeling is that this places uses way to much soy sauce. So we tried: Tuna tartare - the fish didn't taste fresh, it was just bland. Fried chicken liver salad - the chicken was over-fried and dry. Crabcakes - this was great, lots of crab meat and mayonnaise inside. Flank Steak with wassabi noodles - the beef had no flavor, it was quite shocking. I really could only taste the flavor or soy sauce. Braised Beef Short Ribs - this beef was realy fatty, so there was some flavor in it. But I couldn't tell the difference between these 2 beef dishes. They essentially have the same flavorings. The Seabass: again, it had a good caramelization of soy sauce but not really sure what else I'm supposed to taste. Most disappointing of all, the dishes were all accompanied with egg noodles, tossed in hot soy sauce and oil. Finally, we tried the mango dessert (way too sweet, tastes like custard and syrup mixed with tapioca and topped with mango syrup) and the chocolate truffle cake was good, very dense and topped with coffee icecream. Not sure I will go back.

Is it just me or this place just isn't that great for Asian-Fusion? First of all, I went during a rainy day and the "waiting area" was literally a 3x3 square. Try fitting 6 people there along with a party of 12 trying to get out at the same time. It was poor design and I felt really bad for the couple that were sitting right next to the window trying to enjoy their meal and had to deal with people standing right next to their table with their butts facing their food. We had the crab cakes and I tasted more celery than anything else. The presentation was pretty nice but I had better. I had the Flat-Iron steak and my date had the Sea Bass. My noodles were so salty that I downed like 2 glasses of water afterward. I gave up half way. The Sea Bass was nicely done but it was very salty on the top too. I agree with some of the other yelpers about the wait staff. They had no compassion and they just wanted to recite the special and get on with the day. The main wait staff lady had her hair all messed up that it looked like she just rolled out of bed. It wouldn't hurt to use a brush lady.... I was really disappointed overall and maybe they just had an off night.

This place is brilliant! It's definitely one of the best Asian fusion food in the Bay Area. Their unagi with avocado sushi rice appetizer is simply mouth-watering. My favorite main course is the rib eye. Sometimes they have very good special selections too. I once had a pork shoulder there and it was fantastic. The only complain I can give is the difficulty of finding a parking spot there during weekend nights and it's always overcrowded. Even if you have a reservation, you're likely to wait for at least 10 more minutes. But the food more than compensate those two things. By the way, I really wish Yelp changes their review system and enable us to review on the scale of 10, or allow us to give a 1/2 star rating...

We sat down for dinner, and we ordered the Ahi tartare and crab cake for appetizers. Let's start with the positive: the crab cake was beautifully presented, astacknd tasted as good as it looked. Just the right mixture of batter and filling, the crab cake was good to the last morsel. However, I was not as impressed with the ahi tartare. Maybe I'm too much of a traditionalist, but the tartare failed to entice me. All I saw was a futile attempt to dress up leftover bits of sashimi. Nonetheless, I can't fault the excellent presentation, or the burst of flavor that lay at the bottom of the sashimi stack. The House did as well as they possibly could on the tartare. As for entrees, we ordered sea bass and a current special, New York steak. Both dishes were amazing, with generous portions; the sea bass was grilled to perfection, melting in your mouth, and the garlic soy sauce complemented it perfectly. The delicate meat just crumbled when you took a bite, and the noodles help accentuate the flavor of the fish without overpowering it. The New York steak was an equally generous portion, truly the traditional steakhouse meal redefined from an Eastern angle. The strips of steak were succulent and tender beyond compare, even to many specialized steakhouses, and the seasoning added a layer of taste lacking in traditionally prepared steaks. Mashed potatoes and chinese vegetables rounded out the portion and made me feel like I just stepped in to the Asian version of Morton's. The plate left me wanting more and yet fully satisfied. Excellent service, excellent food, excellent ambience. We can't wait to come back to The House!

I didn't know this place until my coworker brought me to this place today We got there around lunch time and we were quickly seated, which was nice because it was packed shortly after A waiter greeted and explained the lunch special as we looked through the menu. ÊWe decided to get the seabass dish with an extra tomato soup for my coworker. ÊFood came out fairly quick with the soup first being served. ÊThe fragrance of the tomato was rich. ÊThen the waiter brought out a plate of fried salmon roll appertizer that was on the house! :-). The salmon roll was pretty good with the wasabi sauce. Ê Our main course came about 10 minutes later. ÊIt had a nice presentation with string beans, stir fried udon noodle, and a hearty portion of the seabass. ÊI liked the string beans and udon noodle a lot, but with a minor concern of how much oil was put on both. ÊThe seabass was a bit of disappointment to me, because I feel that the fish was just a tad overcooked and too salty. ÊWe skipped the dessert menu after we finished our meal. Overall experience was good, with nice portion and quality of food. ÊHowever, I didn't give a five star rating due to the loud noise level of the environment (the restaurant is small and the tables are packed together) and the service was decent (lunch hour rush, as we had to flagged down our waiter couple of times to get some water. He also forgot my lemon on the side). ÊThose are only couple minor details, but I would definitely try this fusion restaurant again.

I'm not usually so generous with my reviews... I usually hand out 5 star reviews to the places where I'm a 'regular'. But my boyfriend took me to The House for the first time on my birthday this past week, and I must say, EVERYTHING was delicious! From our appetizers to our desserts... we may have lucked out by ordering the 'right' things, but even those dishes of our neighbors looked just as tasty. Anyway, I hate it when people leave 5 star reviews without mentioning what they ordered, but I hadn't planned on yelping, so forgive me for the lack of details... We had the crab cake for an appetizer, which was good. Would be great with a side of carbs to go with.. I had the grilled ahi tuna with spicy mustard aioli.. which was p-e-r-f-e-c-t. I've had a lot of ahi tune before, but that night my ahi tuna was cooked perfectly. The sauteed spinach complimented well, and the sauce was great. And I'm not even a fan of wasabi, which I could taste but didn't mind. The boyfriend had the chicken over mashed potatoes.. and these were the creamiest mashed potatoes I've ever tasted. The best part of the dish was the sauce, which had a cheese base, I think ;) For dessert, we had the special for the night.. a pineapple pastry served warm with coconut ice cream. This was the best way to end our meal :) I hope everyone has a chance to try it before it leaves the menu. I will definitely be back to The House... by the way, we had a reservation. The place was crowded on a Wednesday night, so I definitely recommend calling ahead!

Fusion usually disappoints because the flavors are diminished or doesn't taste right, then dressed up with fancy presentation. But there was nothing disappointing about the House. Fortunately I came with a large group so we got to share and try almost the entire menu and the daily specials. My favorite was the sea bass. It was so juicy and well prepared. My second favorite was the fried salmon roll appetizer with wasabi sauce. I thought this was very creative. The fried calamari was just average. The monk fish needs more flavor. Overall the house was excellent value for lunch. You get fine dining level presentation, fine dining level service, great tasting and healthy food for entrees ranging from $10-$20. The place is clean, but the ambiance is just so so. You can't beat that.

One of the most complete meals I've had in the city in a long time. Great food. You could honestly order just about anything on the menu and be extremely satisfied. Highly recommend The House on the basis of the food itself. As everyone knows (and these reviews warned me), the restaurant is very, very small and cramped. Do not expect to be able to have an intimate conversation with your date here (but hey, as long as you're fine with the couple next to you hearing all about your personal life, you should be good). That being said, it was a small price to pay for the amazing meal we had here. The food was that good. My only other complaint is that I was seated at the table closest to the door, so every time someone walked in or out I a) got a nice cold breeze and b) people were constantly bumping into my chair as they made their way past me. Oh well, my girlfriend and I got a few laughs out of it, as it happened pretty much without fail. So, is this a great place to bring a first date? Ehh, probably not (although for the food alone, it is). But if you've been dating someone for a few months now, are comfortable with each other and looking for a great meal, this is the spot. One more tip - parking in this area is obviously pretty tough to come by, so take a cab if you can.

If you're looking for an Asian Fusion place, "The House" is as good as it gets! Over-priced chains like Asia De Cuba don't even compare. You'll definitely need a reservation, but this place is worth the wait. This is one of my "Top 10" places to eat in San Francisco.

I was just here yesterday and without a doubt this was the BEST food I've EVER had! We started off with the salmon rolls which to my surprise were pretty freaken good...except the wasabi sauce- too strong for me. I don't like any taste coming out of my nose lol I had the Chilean sea bass w/ ginger soy with the noodles and green beans. The bass was amazing! It didn't even have a fishy taste. It was grilled to perfection. The noodles were hella good and the greenbeans aswell. My bf had the pomegranite pork which comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The mashed potatoes were ok, nothing special but the pork was delicious, and this coming from a person who isn't crazy about pork! This along with a coke for me, and a beer for my b/f only came to $67! I was expecting something in the $100s for the quality! The only things I didn't like were the location (no street parking AT ALL) and the space...it's so small you're sitting right next to the person beside you. But the food! Oh man, I can't wait to go back!

This is a small, but nice restuarant, with good food. ÊWe've tried the rack of lamb (it's a special so it's not served everyday) - really good, tender and tasty, even though it appeared not to have too much marinade, chliean sea bass - also really good, good soy sauce/ginger dip, korean short ribs (I think it was a special too) - good, and rib-eye steak - bad. Overall, I would definitely come back for the lamb and sea bass.

The House continues to be my favorite restaurant for seafood in the city, because of the Black Cod, which I order every time now. ÊA solid, flaky fillet, chewy rice noodles and a variation on Szechuan green beans, all in perfect balance with each other, and a soy ginger sauce condiment that makes my taste buds sing. ÊGoes well with a glass of the riesling. As I was busy marveling at the food this last time, I suppose I wasn't really paying attention to the service...As my wife pointed out, the wait staff does not really check in on you to see how you like your food. ÊMaybe they're confident that it's awesome. ÊBut in general they are busy scurrying around. ÊI've also found that when The House is especially busy I sometimes have to wait 15-20 minutes, even if I have a reservation. ÊI will forgive all of these things because I love the food so much. Oh, for the appetizer, try the Salmon Roll with Chinese mustard...headache-inducing but delicious!

Delicious! Had a fun date night here with a girlfriend last night. We arrived late in the evening so luckily we didn't have a wait. The food here is PHENOMENOL.

The house rocks my world. Ê Every time that I take a bite out of their pork chop, it puts me in the zone. ÊWhile chewing, I just close my eyes and think of how great life is to be able to eat there and enjoy that. ÊTypically people reflect on how wonderful life is when they win the lottery, are on vacation, found the love of their life or just got a huge promotion. ÊThe pork chops with pomegranate currant sauce does it for me. This is not a five star restaurant, it's a very small, sometimes cramped, and sometimes really loud but the food is always consistently great. ÊThe food is what keeps the customer coming back and the food is what they have so wonderfully learned to perfect.

ÊAn absolutely delicious fillet of tuna excellently prepared on the grill served medium rare with bacon, lettuce, tomato, and a delicious wasabi mayo served on perfectly toasted high quality bread along with a side of mixed greens. ÊIt was sooo good!! Ê The Grilled Salmon with wasabi noodles is also amazing! The food preparation and flavors is/are absolutely top notch.

The House was one of our favorite restaurants during our week long trip in San Francisco. During lunch, we had the Salmon Roll as an appetizer, I had the Wasabi Noodles and my husband had the Tofu Curry Noodles. One of the advantages of going on a trip with someone is that you can try your food and the other's too! Here is how I felt about the different dishes: 1. Salmon Roll: ABSOLUTELY delicious!!! The slivers of salmon was wrapped around a delicate crispy crust and the hot mustard sauce accommodated the roll perfectly. 2. Wasabi Noodles: this was good, but I felt it wasn't spicy enough considering the term "Wasabi" was in the title. I enjoyed the dish, but asked for more hot mustard sauce to make it spicier. 3. Tofu Curry Noodles: I liked this dish very much. It was a little spicy and creamy and the tofu had just enough flavor to compliment the sauce. Ambience was great and the service was helpful too.

Price: A little over $80 for one appetizer, desert, and two entrees. Quite reasonable for high-end. Food: Looking at the fellow Yelpers, we ordered the Ahi Tuna Tartar, Grilled Seabass, and "gambled" on the Pork Chops. We were not disappointed at all. The Ahi Tuna was solid and uniquely separated by nori chips. The seabass included noodles which was the only one that didn't stand out. But the pork chops really hit it for my girlfriend with the pom and currant sauce and she continued to rave about it after which is rare. :) The persimmons pudding had the same texture as a pumpkin pie and I LOVE pumpkin pie. I couldn't taste too much of the persimmons but I didn't care, definitely recommended. Service: ÊVery solid. Our waitress was nice but not the most attentive for a mid-high range type of place. ÊThere was a couple who had to wait 20-25 minutes to get their seats despite reservations but they were treated with appetizers on the house which I thought was very nice of them. Atmosphere: Hard to have a conversation as it seats maybe 60-70 people and there was only one uni-sex restroom which was quite dirty. However it was decent overall. Comparison: Only Asian Fusion that can match it is Xanh's in food quality but very different atmosphere and patrons. Make reservations but definitely a great place to eat.

This place somewhat reminds me of Momofuku in NYC. The food here is good and their Lychee Iced Tea was pretty damn good as well. Unless you decide to eat here last minute I suggest that you make a reservation beforehand if you have a large party. The wasabi noodles with pork is overall a good dish although I couldn't taste a hint of wasabi and the cut of pork could have been better. Nevertheless there was plenty of flavor to go around. Their coconut creme brule with passionfruit pure was decent although the passionfruit pure was a bit too tart and overpowering in some bites. I would definitely come back here to try out other dishes though.

Probably the best fusion restaurant I have ever been to. As a group, we shared three appetizers. The Tuna Tar Tar, Calamari, and Scallops were equally amazing.

Came here for dinner tonight for the first time and enjoyed it! 4.5 stars here! I never really had anything like the foods here before and it was different from other Asian Fusion restaurants I've had before, but delightfully unique. We ordered several dishes and shared it as a party of 5. I have to say the prices are very reasonable, especially for the quality of food. Jasmine tea - We ordered only pot for $6 and they kept on refilling the hot water in it so we had enough for our party throughout our entire meal. Tea was light and fragrant and went well with dinner. Ahi tuna tartare - I had to pass on this one because I'm pregnant, but everyone loved it. Deep-fried salmon roll - Mmmm, this was a yummy starter and the hot mustard sauce went with it nicely. A bit oily, but crispy and delicious. Maine crab cake - It was shaped like a pear and it tasted lighter than most crab cakes that I've had but very scrumptious. The crab meat was tender, sweet, and fresh. The filling complimented the crab perfectly and was finished off with a delicious remoulade sauce. Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak - YUM! I loved the noodles, even though it left a strong zing on my tongue (from the wasabi), but it was so good! The flatiron steak was flavored perfectly! Grilled sea bass - Like all the reviews said, the sea bass is probably the best dish here. It was so tender and fresh and grilled to perfection--melt-in-your-mouth good! Alaskan halibut in curry (today's special) - Delicious! They do fish really well here. Another tender fish cooked to perfection. I'm not usually a big fan of curry & fish but this dish was surprisingly good. Seared hamachi & crab roll (today's special) - The crab roll was yummy (but like any other well-made real-crab california roll) and the seared hamachi wasn't bad but nothing too special or memorable. I think it's hard to do cooked hamachi well but I've had better elsewhere. Overall, the food was great and our dining experience was enjoyable. The flavors were really strong in a lot of the dishes, so every dish kind of hits you with a WHAM, which I'm not that used to for *every* dish at a meal (part of the reason why I knocked off half a star--along with the so-so hamachi), but it's still very delicious.

Last night was my 2nd time eating at the House and it was amazing. The food is delicious, the service is great, and the ambiance is very cozy. There were 4 of us at dinner and we all really enjoyed our dishes. We started with the deep fried salmon rolls and crab cake for the appetizers, both were amazing. My fiance had the sea bass which was awesome - very buttery and flaky tasting and came with these amazing udon type noodles.

had to get the chilean sea bass as many here have raved about.... yes, the fish was delicate and flakey. Êtasty, however the soy sauce was a bit too salty (so don't pour all of it over the fish!!) and the stir fry noodles and fish itself were just a tad bit on the oily side for me. I felt like it was drenched in a lot of unnecessary grease. Ê A slight disappointment, but I was still able to enjoy my food. ÊI've definitely had much better sea bass elsewhere, cooked similarly with Asian ingredients. the boy had a grilled rib-eye steak, medium rare. Êthe cut of beef was surprisingly thin and not so surprising, mostly fat which was very hard to eat...would have been very nice flavors with a filet or another thick cut of meat. the wait was considerably 15-20 minutes even with reservations....which was also kind of annoying. Êhowever, when we were dining we were never once rushed, which I can definitely appreciate. summary: overrated

This place is quaint with attentive, friendly and quick service and delicious food. Reservations are highly recommended and/or necessary. We had a party of 4 and were able to try quite a few dishes. All of the dishes were also beautifully presented. Appetizers: - Kobe beef and papaya salad: beef was perfectly cooked, papaya was sweet and there was a light and tasty dressing. - Fried salmon roll: Creative and delicious! Apparently this is a house specialty. I can understand why. Entrees: - Miso cod: Perfectly cooked, firm yet soft with just the right amount of sauce and veggies. - Pork chop with pomegranate sauce: Wonderfully soft and delicious with the complimenting sweet pomegranate sauce and pieces of pomagranate. I didn't know you could have pork other than well done, but apparently the quality grade of pork The House uses allows for it. - Mushroom rice with prawns: Rice is more like a risotto and the prawns are big and cooked perfectly. - Wasabi noodles with steak: Noodles were cooked just right and the steak was cooked to order. Dessert: - Passionfruit creme brulee: Another creative and delicious dish. Sweet and slightly tart. - Blackberry and nectarine pie with ice cream: YUM! My favorite part of the meal. The fruits were sweet and the crumble on top of the pie was a nice contrast.

My boyfriend took me here for a date night dinner. Super glad he made reservations, because we saw people line up. So highly recommend making a reservation! The restaurant is super small, they should try to expand because they do have the customer's respect, customers lining up for an hour. They have really good seasonal specials, we had the miso halibut and kobe beef truffle reduction . But let me add, this is not you're the average Asian fusion restaurants, they are absolutely Êbeyond that. Their concept is by far the most unique Asian fusion restaurant I every went to. They also have great presentational plates and looking around to our neighboring tables, everyone enjoyed their food. Our server was great and highly knowledgeable about everything on the menu. Good atmosphere and I enjoyed it. Highly recommend if you want to try a more evolve Asian fusion restaurant!

The food here is absolutely amazing. I went here with my sister on a Sunday night and it wasn't hard to make a reservation for 2 at 7:30 just a few hours before. ÊWe ordered the fried salmon rolls for appetizer with spicy mustard which was alright I would say, I had it here before and I think its slightly overrated and will get something else in the future. ÊFor the main entrees, I ordered the black cod which absolutely melts in your mouth, and my sister ordered the Kobe Beef which was delicious as well. ÊBoth were impeccable but definitely not the healthiest if you're concerned with that, both were very fatty meat hence making it delicious. ÊAfter the meal although I felt very satisfied by the meal's deliciousness, I also felt kind of nauseous like I ate pure fat--it didn't quite sit the best in my stomach. I wouldn't recommend the desserts as highly, we got the mango tapioca and the chocolate truffle cake with coconut (the title is something like this), which I thought were both sub-par and couldn't compete to the high-quality of the entrees. ÊThe Mango Tapioca is definitely "interesting" I would put it, it is pretty creamy and unique as I have never tasted anything quite like it. ÊI would say if you're not really into a tangy, sweet, asian (bc of the Tapioca balls), I wouldn't order this. ÊThe chocolate cake was also just OKAY, if I were you I wouldn't get dessert here and just stop somewhere nearby for some Gelato in Little Italy if you really need a sweet fix. Ê My other complaint would probably be the service, it was very difficult to understand the lady who waited on us as her English was definitely not her first language. ÊWhen asking her to describe the individual dishes, she had difficulty explaining to us what exactly each dish was, saying stuff like oh this is "pork", this is "steak" without much elaboration. ÊShe also wasn't the most friendly either. ÊIf the service and venue was better (if the venue was bigger and nicer), the House could get a 5, but its just a bit below that rating in my opinion.

The food was very good. I would highly recommend The House for a swanky dinner on the town. ÊThe service was so so and I feel it does not compete (service wise) with other restaurants in the same price range. I would definitely recommend reservations as it was completely full with a 45 minute wait on a Monday evening. ÊThe other downfall is the neighborhood is not the best. ÊI started with the Asparagus which was delicious and the display was excellent. For my main entree I had the steak which was properly cooked and full of flavor, the mash potatoes were average. ÊFor dessert I had creme brulee which was quite good. ÊOver all I spent $41 before tip and I think it was a very good value! ÊCheck it out!

I guess I'm the negative nelly of the group. The House strikes me as completely overrated; I'd really be comfortable with a 2.5-star rating. I would imagine something in the city with 4+ stars to be quite impressive ... but I didn't see that when I went in. Food: mediocre Ambience: low lighting, cramped quarters, fishy smells Service: good We started with the asparagus. As I had walked in, I had seen a few tables with what looked like long asparagus spears, so I thought it was popular and decided to order it. Little did I know, I was going to end up getting cold asparagus chopped up with peanut dressing and fried carrots. This dish just doesn't make sense. Asparagus is a fresh, summery vegetable and it was paired with a thick spicy peanut sauce; not a good match up. The crisp carrot garnish didn't add anything to the flavor or plate. ÊMy main course was the wasabi noodles with steak, which tons of people have raved about. It wasn't a dish to write home about. It wasn't even a dish I'd revisit. The noodles did taste like wasabi, but not in a fresh and flavorful way. More like someone accidentally dropped wasabi in the wok as they were cooking and decided to go with it. My steak was bland and a bit stringy. the spicy bell peppers on top were the only thing that made it palatable. My date got the sea bass and wasn't impressed at all. So ... what do I think of the house? Boring ...

A bunch of us went here for lunch today to celebrate a ex coworker's birthday. We arrived early at 11:45 and were seated promptly. It's a small restaurant so if you planning to have a meal here during peak meal hours, make reservations. Appetizers: Fried Calamari: tender and decent Salmon Spring Rolls: the Salmon was cooked just right and the wasabi dipping sauce was nice and tangy. I ordered the special soft shelled crab sandwich as the main. The tiny sandwich came with very thin crispy shoe string fries. The sandwich was mediocre and small. It's was so small that I ended up eating some of my coworker's curry noodles with shrimp. I liked the noodles better than I liked my crab sandwich. It's a bit of a hike from the financial district but worth the diversion. ÊOh, I do have to mention that the service was quick if not a little hurried. ÊWe all felt like they were trying to shoo us out of the restaurant as quickly as they could.

I have eaten at The House several times over the last decade, and have always loved it. Last night, after more than a 3-year hiatus from the restaurant (it is always very crowded), my husband and I found a parking space near the restaurant and were able to walk in. ÊI was salivating at the thought of the blue lake bean tempura, which has always been delicious. ÊThe beans arrived and were absolutely tasteless--not greasy, but tasteless. ÊNot even the strong ginger dip could liven them up. ÊThen the chive and shrimp dumplings arrived, and they were ordinary at best. ÊI remember when The House had some of the best Asian fusion in the city. ÊWhat happened? ÊMaybe they just had a bad night, but the food was just not fresh. ÊWe paid our bill after the two appetizers and left.

We found this restaurant by using Yelp and can't say enough great things about our experience. ÊIncredible food, great service, generous helpings, and moderate pricing. Ê We started off with the most delectable calamari and eel with a special sauce on a bed of avocado/mayo mixed rice. ÊThen for our entrees enjoyed the wasabi noodles with steak and delicious pork. Ê Interesting location - just around the corner from the "adult" entertaining area....but still a great atmosphere. The only mild complaint was that we felt like the meals were served much too quick. ÊI think we paid our tab 40 mins after getting there. Ê We can't wait to return to SF to come back.

The food ranges from excellent to pretty good. ÊUsually it's the specials that are excellent, including a perfectly cooked walu (ambiguously called "butterfish" which seems to randomly mean either hawaiian walu or alaskan sablefish) and one of the best lamb chops (grilled with korean bbq spices) I've ever tasted. ÊHits from the menu include the sea bass and the eel appetizer. On food alone it would be an easy 5 stars, but I'd like to dock all those stars for service. ÊService is rushed, very rushed. ÊIf you dawdle with your appetizer, your entree will arrive on top of it. ÊIf you ponder over the menu, you will be hounded for your order. ÊIf you don't eat your eel fast enough, someone will try to take your plate away... twice. ÊHad this happen multiple times, totally unacceptable at a restaurant of this quality. ÊThat said, food rules, so House gets 4 stars.

ÊThe Wasabi noodles w/ Angus Beef is highly recommended as well. The specials that evening included Monkfish in curry - the fish was chewy, something i regret ordering (minus 1). I would have given it four stars, but OUR WAITRESS WAS SNOBBY (minus 1). Two chairs in our table were WET, and she got upset when I asked why the chairs had 'puddles' of water.

My parents came into town and I took them to The House for dinner. The House is a great example of a culinary gem in San Francisco that is a just off the beaten path. ÊDespite being in the heart of North Beach, I had never heard of the joint but went on a friend's recommendation. It doesn't happen very often that you go for a meal and literally EVERTHING we ordered was fantastic. ÊThe waitstaff are very gracious despite how small and crowded the restaurant can be, with only 10-12 tables in the entire restaurant. ÊThe service was great and the food better. ÊI recommend ordering small plates to share, since the menu is so interesting and delicious. ÊTry the Kobe Beef and Mango Salad. ÊIf they have Hamachi as a special, don't pass it up - that yellowtail was tasty. Book a reservation ahead of time, and get a cocktail at one of the little bars nearby if you arrive early.

Angela and Larry's restaurant always delivers with great food and reasonable prices. Their food is comparable in quality to places that cost 2 or 3 times as much. It manages to be hip and current and yet very neighborhood friendly at the same time. The only drawbacks are that is very small and always packed and is very noisy. I find the best bet is to go for lunch when it is much quieter and serves the same great food.Don't forget to save room for dessert as all of the choices are super good.

This place is still probably my favorite fusion cuisine in the city. I will explain the 3 stars. First, the hostess. ÊI mean, wow, fix your hair. ÊI started coming to the House when it first opened and the host/hostess then did not look like they rinsed their hair with grease. ÊShe can be rude too. Second, the wait. ÊI guess there is nothing you can really do when a place gets popular. ÊI made a 7:30 reservation and did not get seated until 8:15. ÊThe hostess (same greasy haired lady) was pretty rude about it. ÊOne of those, "you can wait or leave" attitude. Third, the wait staff. ÊIt is sad, I used to know the original two servers on a first name basis and they were great. ÊI mean, they knew the menu inside out and I never had an empty cup on my table. ÊThey were that good. ÊRecently, the new hires seems to forget about you. ÊI asked for a water refill three times before I got it. ÊOnce again, cannot be helped once a place gets popular and super busy. Overall, the food is still 5 Stars. ÊI am really glad that has not changed. Tips: 1. Make a reservation!!! ÊWaiting 45 minutes with a reservation is better than waiting 2 hours without! 2. Try the specials!!! ÊAside from a regular menu, they have daily specials for appetizer, entree, and dessert. ÊTheir specials have always been great. Ê 3. Get a dessert!!! ÊTheir desserts are always great!! Highly recommended. (Note on the wheelchair accessibility: ÊIf you get there early and the place is relatively empty, then yes. ÊIf you go when it is busy, then half the restaurant will have to get up to accommodate.)

This place is pretty much always crowded and there is always a wait, so I don't know why I am "sharing" my favorite place in Northbeach with even more people that will cause me to wait even more.. but, I must admit, this place really rocks! Ê I have not had anything on the menu that I did not absolutely LOVE. Admittedly, I usually get one of the "specials" and have not tried much of the items on their regular menu. ÊThe Sea Bass with the sushi roll on top is a must-try.. their braised spareribs and flat-iron steak are the very best you will find anywhere. The service can be spotty and a bit abrupt at times. I already mentioned the wait at the door and it is packed.. the seating is pretty tight.. you will hear conversations around you, that is unavoidable. Parking is the suck. But, if you like great asian-fusion food.. the best I have found the world round.. you owe it to yourself to try The House.

The hostess seated us almost immediately on a Saturday night at 7:30 despite having no reservation, which was surprising with the meal quality taken into consideration. Everything that we had was uniquely excellent. The prime rib salad (special) was a perfect shared starter item. The sea bass entree was perfect - melts in your mouth and served at ideal temperature, although presentation was weaker than everything else that we saw. The winner was the ahi entree, I just wish they provided more of the aioli sauce. Dessert - dark chocolate bread pudding was above average...a little cheap, the bites that actually had dark chocolate pulled the rating up. All in all, good experience with the seating staff, wait staff were great, entrees were excellent. I will be back.

I love their food. Its delicious. But I dont recommend anyone to come for dinner, even with reservation. Been here many times with and without reservation, with a big groups or just two of us. Dinner service sucks. The server is not helpful. And once I was there without reservation, the manager told us to finish our food in 1 hour. No problem if the food did not arrive after 45 minutes wait. However I would really-really recommend everyone to come for lunch especially weekdays. Parking is another reason why I only come for weekdays lunch. Its crazy to find parking at night. I love their seabass with garlic noodle. It is soooooo delicious. It is what I always order. The salmon rolls are great too. White shrimp tempura salad is yummy. Unagi avocado sandwich is surprisingly so GOOD. Other things (like crab cake) are just ordinary.

It's been several years since I ate at House. ÊI remembered how much I had loved their food in the past and Êwanted to eat there on my birthday, but was a little wary due to the frequent Yelp complaints about late seatings and the cramped, noisy atmosphere. ÊThe memories of the food won out however. When we arrived on time for our 8:30 reservation, there were several people crowded by the doorway waiting. ÊThe hostess was right there waiting to greet us, and told us our table would be a "few minutes". ÊI was expecting this but I didn't expect to be kept waiting while a table for two (set for 3 people) sat empty. ÊAfter waiting 10 minutes, I made a second inquiry about the timing of our seating. ÊThe hostess said "they have their check", attempting to transfer blame to the diners at "our" table. ÊMeanwhile the table for 2, set for 3, sat empty. ÊAs my Honey and I discussed how long we'd wait before bailing out for Vicoletto, another local favorite, the empty table was re-set for 2 people, and we were seated. ÊGiving House the benefit of the doubt, we like Êto think the table was reserved for a no-show, rather than being kept empty for a hoped-for walk-in of 3 people. After being seated, we were promptly given water and menus, and before long the waitress appeared to describe the specials, after which she promptly turned and left without taking a drink order. ÊIt was minutes before we were able to flag the hostess to request some drinks. Several tables were seated with more people than they fit comfortably; in theory this wouldn't be a problem for us, being 2 people, except the chair jammed in next to our table to make a table for 4 a table for 5 made us continually worried about our table being bumped and drinks spilt. ÊWe were more comfortable when the group at that table left and it was subsequently seated with only 4 people. After we received our drinks, the dinner went more smoothly. ÊService was prompt and attentive. Ê What really shines at House is the food itself. Ê I ordered the special salad, lobster tempura with mixed greens, for my appetizer. ÊIt was delicious. ÊFor my entree, I tried the special grouper dish with mussels, served in a light but flavorful broth with thai flavors. ÊThis was superb. ÊHoney had the green bean tempura; flavorful but a bit greasy, and the pork chop, delicious he said but very rich. ÊDessert was an excellent chocolate pecan tart with vanilla ice cream. Excellent food, somewhat uncomfortable and cramped conditions, very noisy but a bit less so later in the evening (after 9).

The special of grilled calamari was perfectly tender, which is such a rarity (the sauce was excellent too). I probably have the same experience as everyone else regarding the sea bass. Good thing not everyone cooks it this well, or else they might be headed towards extinction... oh wait. We were the last ones in the restaurant and behind the counter knocked a (empty!) tea cup on the date. I have heard of subtler ways of getting someone to leave!

I always take my friends here to eat whenever we decide to go to the city. ÊEven though the restaurant is small it provides some of the best food you can find in San Francisco. I've been here multiple times and each time I was smart enough to make a reservation. ÊThey are always packed for dinner, but sometimes if you're lucky you can sit down for lunch. ÊAlways make reservations for Friday and Saturday otherwise you may not even get a chance to wait for a table. ÊBecause of the small size of the restaurant I really wouldn't suggest a party of more than 6. The food is always amazing. ÊThey have very creative specials changing every week, and each of them sound so tantalizing I always order at least one special each time I go. ÊThe appetizers are usually enough for only two people, but you can ask the wait staff to alter the price and amount of food for each appetizer to fit the number of people in your party. They do have a pretty modest wine list and the prices are quite reasonable. ÊTheir desserts are also very delicious and sometimes they run out on a busy night. ÊAll in all I would say that The House is definitely a great place to show off to your friends that you know where some really good food is made. Also for a side note, depending on the night, it can be very noisy so expect to talk with a bit more volume when you go. ÊIt can be very intimate for dates because you'll be able to lean in quite close so that your partner will be able to hear what you're saying.

3.5 stars to be exact. I called in 1.5 weeks earlier to make a reservation for a Friday night for 10 people. ÊI was given a good reservation time (7 pm) but was warned to be on time since we would only have our table for 1.5 hours. Ê After freaking out about everyone NOT being on time, they were able to seat us when 8/10 people were there at 7 pm. Ê On our side of the table, we shared the scallop Caesar salad which was pretty good; the fried calamari which can't be done wrong (unless you're a crappy restaurant...and i have been to those crappy restaurants); the ahi tuni which was fresh; and the mushroom soup that was like any other good mushroom soup. For entree, I had the flat iron steak, cooked rare, and it was chewy. ÊI know flat iron steaks are usually a little chewy, but everyone raves about this dish, so I was a little disappointed. ÊThe garlic noodles were okay, a little mild in the garlic flavor. Ê My boyfriend had the Sea Bass and it was really good. ÊIt came with garlic noodles as well and some green beans. ÊMy favorite out of all the dishes. My sister had the kobe beef (which was a special that night) and it was top notch kobe. ÊIt was mediocre kobe which came out a little tough. Ê My best friend had the butterfish that she loved, but I thought was a little dry. ÊThe Toro that came with the dish was very fresh though. Ê Other people had chicken that was okay. ÊThe sauce was good and it wasn't dry. Ê We skipped dessert, but overall the meal was good, not great. ÊI was excited about HOUSE because of all the wonderful reviews, so maybe my expectations were a little too high. ÊI would only come back if someone else asked me to. Ê Side note: ÊRead the signs on Broadway. ÊCars get towed after 8 pm on Friday and Saturday nights. ÊMy boyfriend learned a $450 lesson that night.

Not much to add to the already excellent reviews this place has, so I will do a quick summary. Excellent food at a reasonable price... what else really is there. The only complaint is that they serve these pickled cucumbers (I think they were cucumbers) in place of bread, but charge you a dollar each time you receive more. I know its only a dollar, but that isn't the point, charging for this just seems a little ridiculous. Anyway, the $1 cucumbers won't stop me from returning.

I really do enjoy asian fusion restaurants and The House is no exception. This place is a tiny little nook, so reservations are a great idea.They have the typical menu that you would expect from any asian fusion place and i've never had anything that I didn't thoroughly enjoy here. Êif they have the miso black cod, you have to get it!

This is my most favorite restrarant by far. I have tried almost everything on thier menu and I can honestly say that i'm more than satisfied each time. The sea bass is my favorite, you just can't go wrong with it! The place is a little small, but suits well. I have never had to wait longer than I needed to and the service is on point! The food is sooo worth every penny.

Hands down no questions asked the best restaurant in San Francisco in my mind! Ok this guy knows how to cook, how to match sauces, how to organize plates, how to serve people, how to hire a great staff...seriously I've never once found a flaw in this place! I go about once a week, often times 2 or 3 times! I can't say enough about this place. It's truly one of those restaurants that can easily charge double what they do and I'd still go...but THAT'S the best part! It's fairly inexpensive. A $15 lunch for gourmet food is just ridiculous! If you haven't been and are looking for a good lunch...talk a walk from the financial district. If you are looking for a GREAT date place this is your ticket as the seating is just right where you aren't packed in and yet a cozy feel to it. Bottom line --- 5 stars and one of SF's finest.

It's a pretty cute place and it's literally a house so what a great name they have. I came here for dinner and I found their food to be average. It's not bad but not the best either. Started with the fried salmon rolls. It came loaded with salmon but I didn't find it that tasty. In my opinion, I think the fire cracker salmon rolls at cheesecake factory taste better, more flavor. For my entree I had the steak with garlic noodles. The steak was good but not as tender as I thought it would be. The garlic noodles were different. It's good in its own way but I expected to really taste the garlic. The bf had their special for the night, duck with raspberry sauce. It was beautifully presented and he said the meat was tender and juicy, he liked it. I tried some but I didn't like the sauce. I'm more of the type where if something should be sweet then it should just be sweet and if it's suppose to be salty then the whole thing should be salty. I'm not really into the in betweens where its both sweet and salty. That's just me though, I'm sure a lot of people would like it. It wasn't busy at the time we went because we ate at 6. There were just two table including us on a Friday night. The service was very good. Our waiter was very attentive. Well of course it'd be since the place was practically empty at that time. It is extremely small here so I can't imagine how it'd be when it's busy. I haven't been back in a while so I would want to give it another try at their other dishes.

Same day review, while everything is still fresh in my mind... Just went there 3 hrs ago for dinner with my Hubby for his birthday (happy birthday hubby!) ÊWe agree with other people who've written reviews for this place, the food is superb. ÊVery nice flavors that work well together. ÊI would have given it a 5 star, except that the service tonight was quite disappointing. Ê:-( For appetizers, we ordered Asparagus with sesame dressing (loved the dressing), fried salmon roll (beware of the chinese mustard sauce, very hot!), and tuna tartar (just ok, probably won't order that again though). For entrees, Hubby had a ribeye steak and I had the pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce. ÊI loved my pork chop (huge portion) and thought that the sauce complimented the meat very well. ÊI also had a bite of hubby's steak and thought that it was quite nice, though flavor was a bit simpler. Ê Only complain about the menu is the lack of variety on the desserts. ÊWe ended up ordering the coconut creme brulee with passion fruit puree. ÊIn my opinion, the concept of the dish is quite nice, contrasting the tartness of the passion fruit puree with the creme brulee. ÊThe execution, though, was another story. ÊThe sugar was over burnt at part of the creme brulee to the point that it was bitter! Ê:-( Ê Biggest downer of the night is the service. ÊI don't think (and certainly hope not) that the service we had tonight is normal, reason being that we actually witnessed a bit of a spat between 2 waiter/ess(s) regarding some issues. ÊAfter that, I think it all went downhill and I can actually feel the tension throughout the night (plus the restuarant was quite busy tonight), since we were quite close to the epicenter. ÊI don't think anyone was rude or anything, and we always have our waters filled and plates cleaned out. ÊHowever, I don't feel any bit of friendliness nor "service" as one would expect in the restaurant. Ê All in all, I'd give The House the benefit of the doubt and visit again in the future to try out other dishes on the menu. ÊHopefully the service will be better next time.

I made reservations for two on a busy friday night. After a long pre-drink w/ a few friends we decided to head over and try to make our 7:00 reservation. we did not! i called at about 6:45 and instructed the hostess that I would be running late, say around 8:00. I show up at 8:00 with an extra guest, so now I need a table for 3 as opposed to 2; a huge difference Êin the industry. the hostess assured me that it NOT would be a problem and promptly seated us. ( this place gets 5 stars for that alone) The waitress comes to our table comment son the extra guest, Êand goes right into the days specials. I ended up getting , well I dont remember as It all failed in comparios to the sea bass. get it ! you will not be disappointed.

The House's cuisine is always delicious. ÊGenerally when I hear about an Asian fusion restaurant I'm pretty leery, but everything is extremely well done here, from the appetizers to the desserts. ÊThe food is excellently prepared and beautifully presented. ÊIt's probably my favorite North Beach restaurant. The service is always very good, and the staff is very knowledgeable about the menu. ÊYou may find yourself waiting for a few minutes to be seated, even with a reservation, but that's because the restaurant is small and the people at your table are probably lingering over a nice dessert. ÊDon't be too upset, the wait is definitely worth it.

Every time I go here it is really good. Lunch or dinner. Specials are excellent. Fish, and sashimi specials, in particular, is good. I will not call this asian fusion, because most of the time asian fusion is mush, and this is far above any asian fusion. Some of the best food in SF, hands down in Bay Area. Always go out of my way to visit. I easily overlook the location and parking.

YUMMM!!! I have to be totally honest, the first time I dragged my friends here it was because I TOTALLY thought it was a different restaurant. I was INSISTENT on coming here, got there, was confused, then had to play it off like, yeah, I totally knew this place was awesome, what the f*ck are you looking at? I've only been here 3 times over the last year, but each time has lived up to the time before. The sea bass and butterfish are consistently good. One of the times we went we had a pork butt roast that just fell apart with the fork; the most recent time I had duck that was just absolutely perfect and tender and not gamey tasting at all. Basically, the seafood and the meats have been delish every time; don't even know if they do poultry dishes but I'm sure they would be good. The deserts seem to be pretty straightforward and simple but after all the appetizer and entree goodness, it's nice to have a nice simple finish to your dinner. The creme brulee is always a favorite, and I'm a big fan of the apple pie equivalent the have for desert. Because it's North Beach, take a cab. And make reservations - this place looks like it could probably only seat 40-50 people at a time.

This place really doesn't even need more reviews but I had to because reminiscing on this meal makes my mouth water. My date and I showed up, without reservations, on a busy Thursday night around 9:30pm. ÊWe were the last table seated, with everyone else finishing up their main courses or desserts, so the food came out very quickly. ÊWhile there was almost no wait between the app and the main, the staff didn't make us feel rushed at all. We ordered a soft shell crab special, fried green beans, the pork chop, and the ahi steak. ÊThe pork chop definitely was the highlight of the night although everything was delicious. Can't wait to go back

I had the risotto dish which is composed of rice and mushrooms in a very delicious sauce. The creamiest delicious risotto I have had to date! The wait was long, but what wait isn't long for a quality place. Also the restaurant itself was small and crowded, a bit annoying that someone itself is sitting 3 feet or so away from you.

I went here on July4th and it was packed. Thankfully, reservations were made. The place wasn't that big which was nice. It had a nice ambiance to it. I believe we ordered the tuna tartar, kobe beef and the sea bass. It was all very delicious. For some reason I expected the dishes to be petite but it turned out to be a good serving. The tuna tartar was our appetizer and it was good. Nothing too special though. The kobe beef and sea bass was our entrees. The kobe beef was nice and tender. It was accompanied by mash potatoes and cauliflower. I believe the sea bass was grilled. It was served with noodles and sugar snap peas. The sea bass also came with a dipping sauce which was very salty...it was unnecessary. ÊThe sugar snap peas and sea bass was delicious. The snap peas were cooked perfectly left with a nice little crunch to it. The sea bass melted in my mouth. The noodles on the other hand was okay. We ordered the coconut creme bržlŽe for dessert. It was quite interesting. It had a passionfruit sauce on top. I would say the creme bržlŽe was okay. I couldn't taste the coconut at all which sucked cause I really wanted to see how different it would have been. I would probably stick to the original creme bržlŽe. Overall I had a great satisfying meal! The service was good too. It's definitely a great friend/date spot(:

Interesting... So apparently I'm one of the few who had a negative experience here. Came here and got seated right by the entrance where people are crowding around us. We asked to change seats (there were many open tables) but they refused to let us. The atmosphere here felt awful, the restaurant is small and crowded.

It's been a while since the last time I've been here and we decided to go to the The House for Jason G's bday dinner...big 4 0 baby! ÊHappy 4th decade bday buddy! ÊOur friend Kevin had a couple of wine bottles, but the bday boy and I already had enough booz for his bday last Friday. ÊHowever, peer pressure from these guys usually wins over my response of "HEEELLS NO!" to alcohol. ÊThis is probably the 4th time I've been here and was never dissappointed. ÊFor appetizers, we had the salmon egg rolls and it was pretty good, but my friend's sister in law made it better, but now I know where they got the idea from. ÊWe also had the unagi with avocado sushi rice and it was also pretty good. ÊIt definitely tastes better than sushi restaurants's unagi sushi. ÊThe last appetizer was complimentary scallop with some fruity sauce and it was perfectly cooked. ÊFor entrees, my friend and I had the black cod and it was good. ÊThe 4 decade bday boy...oops...man...had the kurobuta pork chop and it was probably the best pork chop I've ever had and was cooked to perfection. ÊChan H had the sea bass and that was pretty good too. ÊFor dessert, we had their very popular mango tapioca and creme brulee. ÊMango tapioca was delicious and the creme brulee was pretty good. ÊHowever, near the end of our desserts, I did have a slight bad end to the dinner. ÊA man sat down on the table next to me and all of a sudden I get a whiff of some super strong, disgusting, pungent, and old smell. ÊIt was the guy's cologne! ÊHoly crap Batman! ÊSomeone get me a gas mask, because I'm about to pass out! ÊIt was far worse than the Chinese tiger oil balm "bok fa yau" that my mom and grandparents used to use when they feel sick.

ÊService was very attentive in filling up the glasses of water and cleaning up the plates. ÊI give this place a 4 star, which had nothing to do with the man's cologne, but they seriously need to space out the tables more, because it's very cramped.

i'm torn after my dinner at the house. Êlet me explain.... appetizers - the steamed mussel were super fresh and pillowy. Ê - the seared scallops were also quite good but a bit too oily tasting from the cooking grease. mains - miso black cod: very good. Êthe fish was cooked very well and the skin was nice and crispy. Êthe miso marinate was not overpowering and really tied everythign together - slow cooked pork w/ foie gras: this was a braised pork topped with seared foie in a broth and served with a side of white rice. Êthis dish was very good with the pork being quite succulent and hell, how can you go wrogn with topping protein with sear foie? - american kobe steak: this was a total bust. Êthe steak was cooked a nice rare as requested.....but man, this steak was the most gristly piece of eat i have eaten in my life. Êsteaks at hometown buffet are less gristly than the steak i was served at the house. we did not stick around for dessert. as you can see, most of the food was good barring the oily scallops and the atrociously gristly "kobe" steak. Êwill i go back? Êprobably, but not anytime soon.....however, i want to try the heralded pork chops some day. service was ok throughout the evening. one of the servers was grumpy mcfee that evening and he cast a dark shadow. Êgood thing the remaining servers were pretty cool and actually looked happy to be there.

My good friend named Kristen works here and my other good friend says this is his favorite restaurant. So of course, when I was trying to figure out where to go to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday, I ended up making a reservation here to finally try it out after a year of hearing good things. (Definitely get reservations, it is a busy place and there is no waiting area unless you like the outside when it's cold.) I probably annoyed Kristen a lot because I kept bothering her about the surprise cake I was going to send here directly from the baker's. It got quite complicated for various reasons but she was very patient with me and helped me pay the baker upon delivery since I couldn't be there to do it myself, so this saved me the trip of going all the way to the bakery just to pay for it. So just to let you guys know, they have a great person on their staff. What I didn't realize was that the place is very small. There are mostly four-people tables and a few two-seaters, one of which we took up near the back since we didn't want to be in the front where everyone would be going in and out. The tables are very close together, and while I liked the cool interior design of the set-up, it was a bit too cramped and I could hear every word the people from the table next to us were saying and I'm sure they could hear us as well. I also noticed that there's only room around the tables for people in a single file to get to and from the bathroom and kitchen, which are right next to each other. I went to the bathroom twice and had to step aside for someone else to cross or let someone else step aside for me to cross. The waiter I was about to bump into the second time graciously stepped aside for me, so here's to another member on the staff who has great manners. I really wanted Kristen to serve us but another girl did ... she was fine, but kind of walked past us without a signal every time we needed something before coming back to help us (so she obviously saw that we needed something every time ... and just didn't give notion that she did). It was always a little awkward but it was whatever, she was a fine waitress, just wouldn't be my favorite. The food is fabulous. I can see why so many people would like it. I ordered the angus ribeye steak with house-made teriyaki sauce in medium rare and my boyfriend had the kurobuta pork chop with pomegranate sauce. I enjoyed my steak very much but I loved my boyfriend's meal even more. I kept sopping up his leftover pomegranate sauce with my steak, it was that good. I thought the pomegranate sauce would be on the weird side but it was totally great. The staff helped me put a candle on the cake and presented it to my boyfriend at the right timing. I'm quite sad we forgot to take a picture of the cake before they took it back to cut it up but it was still a great evening. I liked the way they cut the cake pieces evenly for the both of us before packaging it back up nicely for us to take home. They do charge $3.00 per person if you bring your own cake but they're so nice about it that I didn't mind when my friend told me of this. Everything plus two sodas, one tea, and tip ended up being $78.00 in total. Well worth it, I'd say. Not too expensive, just right.

You can't miss-- every dish is superbly executed by my favorite chef :arry Tse. His wife Angela, who runs the front of the house, watches every move making sure every diner has the best experience. She runs a tight, tight ship, taking service to a new level. For an out of this world mouth watering experience....GO TO THE HOUSE!!!!!

ÊWe walked up Grant and saw 2 more parking spaces. ÊIt was just before11:30 on Monday. ÊMade me sorry we didn't have more cars or something. ÊWe had reservations for 11:30. ÊFor once Rinky and I were there first. ÊUsually Marian and Anna are there first, patiently waiting. ÊI loved standing around outside the restaurant looking at the old time North Beach neighborhood, remembering how I used to hang out there when I was younger. We were the first people in the restaurant. ÊIt's small but larger than it looks from the outside. ÊWe were brought lovely little house made pickle pieces, which we quickly demolished. ÊFor $1 we ordered more. ÊThe menu is fairly extensive and there were specials as well. ÊWe ordered the steamed mussels w/ garlic infused shrimp broth and blue lake bean tempura with a pickled ginger soy dipping sauce. ÊThe mussels were a large enough portion for three seafood eaters to share and the tempura was light and perfectly cooked. ÊThe sauce was a tasty accent. ÊMarian, Anna and I ordered the sea bass, a generous portion accompanied by garlic noodles and what looked to be cut up long beans. ÊRinky ordered the grilled Chinese chicken salad with sesame soy vinaigrette. ÊThe bass was tender and moist, the garlic noodles thicker and more subtly flavored than those at Red Crawfish and the beans were al dente and nicely seasoned. ÊIt was an excellent and filling lunch at $20. ÊRinky's Chinese chicken salad was artfully arranged and when deconstructed was much larger than it first appeared. ÊShe reported it was very good and took much of it home. ÊFor dessert three of us shared a delicious creme brulŽe w/ a mango purŽe. ÊSo good! Ê Afterward we walked over to Molinari, where Rinky and Marian bought stuff while Anna and I watched, sated, though it didn't stop us from ogling all the wares. ÊThen we walked over to Victoria Pastries and Rinky, Marian and Anna all bought little somethings. ÊIt was another great outing in stellar company.

This dish though was definitely really only god for 1-2 people. We split it between 3 so it wasn't not enough for everyone to be satisfied. [W] As for the deep fried salmon roll, it's good by itself without that mustard sauce. Maybe it's just me because I don't like mustard and it had a little wasabi taste on it as well. The butterfish on the other hand was really good. I think that I should've gotten that rather than the salmon haha. I think I'm going on a little salmon strike for a little while until I can find a place that cooks it really well. One more thing to add is to TRY OUT THE OYSTERS!!! They're so good. Probably one of the best places that I've had it. I know all the oysters taste the same BUT The House sauce was what made the difference! [M] For dessert, I had the Passion Fruit Creme Brulee. The passion fruit was a little on the sour and I don't think i would have minded if they left it out. It was still really good none the less : ) The House has become my favorite restaurants in San Francisco and I will definitely be back again!

This restaurant deserves a 10 star rating if it were available on yelp. Food, drinks, appetizers, decor, service, location = Fantastic! Located in North Beach hidden within grant ave in a neighborhood known as Little Italy in SF stands a small restaurant called "The House" yup..that's the name. There's probably around 20 seats inside the whole restaurant a clear indication as to why it's always packed. Dined here on a Tuesday evening with some friends that lived in SF, we started off with appetizers: tuna tartare w/ roasted nori chips (good but a bit bland) maine crab cake (amazing and flaky crab cakes) classic fried calamari (had like 5 small calamari pieces at most and not worth the price) and deep fried chicken liver (wasn't a fan). I ordered the warm wasabi noodles w/ angus flatiron steak and I was blown away by the quality and taste of the dish. The steak was cooked to perfection topped with what looked like kimchee, the noodles was a bit spicy but not over the top. It was so flavorful that I didn't want to tell anyone about it so I can have it all to myself. Selfish, I know but you'll understand once you've had it. I had a bite of the sea bass that my friend ordered and each morsel melted in your mouth. Everything on the menu was reasonably priced, each dish ranged from $17- $25 which made the whole experience much more enjoyable. Big props to the chef who I later found out was chinese but is a huge fan of japanese food so he wanted to infuse chinese, american and japanese food all together which is a great idea on his part. Did I mention that the presentation of each dish was incredible?? Each dish came out in an art form, it was like a painted canvas that he's expressed with food. Now I only wish there was a location in LA. If you're going on a hot day, make sure you ask for a table near the door because the place doesn't have AC. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone that's in the SF area...absolutely fantastic!

Forget James at the bar. Shatangi spied the hottest food runner in all of North Beach!! And the food!?!?!?!?!??! Shaggable!!!!! We started with the salmon tempura roll and decided to try the special ahi roll as well. Prepared much the same way but presented in drastically different manners with a spicy mustard sauce for the salmon and a creamy sauce with the tuna. For the main dishes we ordered beef two ways, the skirt steak with spicy noodles from the menu and a kobe beef served with a wonderful mushroom sauce and turned daikon. The entire meal was perfectly cooked and expertly timed by our server. We enjoyed a reasonably priced bottle of Shiraz with our meal and finished with a chocolate tart and bread pudding with berries. We found ourselves taking turns with each dish. I really appreciated the teamwork demonstrated by the staff. One server left his station to help clear plates from our table. You do not see that often any more. We also spent some time discussing our meals with the people at the tables on either side of us, comparing notes and writing down next time musts. One guy was busy taking pictures of his meal as each course was served. I feel like I have found a new love. Shatangi told you

Contrary to what they tell you in school, "Run... don't walk!" ÊThat's right, get there as soon as you can for their Spicy Miso Halibut. ÊWe came here for a late lunch and this was the day's lunch special. ÊI had my doubts at first as I asked the waitress whether it was moist or dry and flaky like most halibut dishes. ÊShe had me at "moist" (it was moister than the sea bass). ÊIt is served with bowl of white rice, perfect for sopping that delicious spicy broth with Napa cabbage and other veggie; I do not know the price as I lost our Chinese game of "Who's Gonna Grab the Bill?" ÊWe dined family style on this along with their Barbecued short ribs (Kalbi) and Grilled Sea Bass. ÊNice coming here for lunch if you want to miss the crowd madness during dinner time. ÊYou might want to call to confirm that the halibut is on the menu. ÊIf it is.... RUN!

OMG, this is a must come place to eat food with a lot of different flavors. I was very nervous about taking my friends here for dinner because I picked it out. When the food came, all I heard was hmmm and hmmm from my friends. Everything was amazing and the presentation was perfect. My only complaints were that the place was pretty small and they asked us to not to take too many pictures. My favorite dishes were the sea bass and kobe beef tartar. I can't wait to come back here again.

I have wanted to try this place for quite awhile. Too bad it was a disaster! I'd give the food 4 stars, but the service was what ruined it for me. From the moment we were seated, the waitress was hostile. When she came over to our table, (and we were talking) she turned on her heel after standing there for about 2 seconds. The next time she came back, she did the "wrap it up" motion with her hand. WTF???? From then on, every time she came to the table she was in a huff. Apparently, we were supposed to be giving her our absolute attention at all times.When we weren't she rolled her eyes, sighed, turned on her heel and stalked off. We tried to ignore her rude behavior and enjoy our meal. She wasn't about to let that happen. I ordered the black cod, (which I've had several other places. Once at Nobu where the dish was invented, so I know how it should taste.) It was really spicy, and it definitely shouldn't have been. Especially since she never mentioned it was. I quickly realized it was the wasabi in the roll on top of the fish. When i called her over, and asked her about it, she insisted there was no wasabi in it. Another person at our table had the same dish, and agreed. Then the waitress got even more pissed. All i did was suggest that she might want to tell people that when she describes the special. (Since it's not on the menu, there's no way to read it.) She went on to take the dish out from under me while i was in mid-bite. Once again...WTF???? She continued to make snide,argumentative comments throughout what was left of the meal. Seriously, if everyone else hadn't totally agreed, I would have thought I'd lost my mind. I was in shock that any server would behave this way. It was truly unbelievable. I called the manager the next day, (which i never do.) She wasn't much better than the server. Apparently, the server had already called the manager to tell her about our table. Why she chose to tell me this only further illustrates her lack of professionalism. I did feel some smugness when the manager informed me the roll did have wasabi in it. Although, that really wasn't Êthe whole problem. Even if that hadn't happened, I still would have called. The service was that despicable. The manager didn't Êapologize, or show any remorse that our dinner was made so unpleasant. Another friend at our table called, and she was told "We have a lot of neighborhood regulars." So, apparently, if you don't live in North Beach, the manager really isn't interested in your business. No one at our table will EVER go back here. I have never seen, or personally experienced this behavior and attitude from a restaurant. I want to tell as many people as possible about this horrible experience. Maybe then the manager will learn you need the people that don't live in North Beach too. ****I also wanted to add, I've never written a review this long. But, there was no other way to fully explain this experience.*****

A solid 4* if it weren't for the otherworldly veggies that come with the sea bass. Overall the food was very good, and reasonably priced. We had no problems waiting since they accept reservations even on a busy night. However, since the place is small you can't come here if you have a big caboose as you'll be knocking over other people's drinks. True story.

asian fusion done right! the house is one of my favorite restaurants in the city, and my default recommendation for out of towners. everything i've had here has been tasty, especially any seafood dish and the garlic noodles. the kurobuta pork chop with pomegranate sauce was also really good, and the mushroom rice with prawns is much better than it sounds - a creamy risotto with mushrooms topped with grilled prawns. the space is cramped and tiny so definitely make reservations and even then, be prepared to wait once you arrive at the restaurant.

I would not base my decision to dine at this place based on their 2000+ review 4.5 stars. I've been to a lot of yelp places and was expecting amazing when I saw the reviews. The food was OK. Salmon spring roll and octopus salad both lacked flavor. If everything tasted like the black cod special, I would have to agree with the 4.5 starts. That was just not the case. If you go in with a 3-star attitude, I don't think you'll be disappointed. ÊNext time I'm in SF, I'm gonna go back to the Slanted Door.

**UPDATE** 1/25/2007 Ê I originally gave el house 5 stars but after trying to take some friends here last night it was an utter disappointment. ÊEvery time my parents come to visit SF we always eat here. ÊSo Ive been a few times. ÊThe space is small and I understand you may need to wait for a table especially for a party of 6. ÊOur reservation was for 830pm. ÊWe arrived on time and 30 minutes later we were still standing outside in the rain waiting. ÊWe asked the hostess with the crazy fucked up looking hair and she informed us they were waiting for a table in the back to leave. Those douche bags were jerking off for an hour. ÊI wanted to punch them all in the face. ÊWhen a small ass restaurant is bursting at the seems with people waiting to get in please have some common courtesy to get the fuck out and not sit around jerking it for an hour after you finish your dessert. ÊSo anyways the douche bags finally get up and leave. ÊAround 910pm a party of 9 shows up late for their 9pm reservation. ÊThey talk to the hostess and admit to her they are late and asked if it was ok. ÊThey said yeah no problem. ÊWhen they clear the table and set everything up I was ready to be seated. ÊThe hostess with the fucked up hair seated the party of 9 instead. ÊI understand you want to make more money by seating the larger party. ÊBut we had a party of 6 that was on time and waiting to be seated since 830pm. ÊSo instead of seating us and having the party of 9 wait a few fucking minutes they decide to fuck us over and wait until another area clears. ÊWTF? ÊThe hostess with the fucked up hair apologized after I confronted her but thats just bad business ethics. ÊYeah you seated a party of 9 and gained an extra 3 people. ÊBut you also lost a party of 6 you fucks. ÊDo the math and you lost money that night. ÊFuck this place. ÊI am never going back. ÊI don't give a fuck how good the food is. ÊWaste my fucking time. ÊThe house can eat a bowl of shit. Ê Original review: The House is a small house. ÊThere is always a wait and you should make reservations. ÊMy fat parents love this place because its next to Chinesetown. ÊRetarded. ÊI have been in the house 3 times now. ÊThe first two times were awesome but the third time was so so because their menu and specials NEVER change. ÊThe menu is decently sized but everytime I have gone they always offer the black cod and pork chop special. ÊIf you have never been then definitely try the black cod. ÊIts very good. ÊThe appetizers here are ok. ÊThe main attractions are the entrees. ÊThe crab caked appetizer is shaped like cock and balls. ÊIts suppose to be a volcano (I think) but it comes out extra long and round at the top sometimes. ÊI think the chef was trying to tell me something. ÊThe salads are decent including the cesar and seared tuna. ÊFor entrees the Seabass is a must order. ÊIts nicely grilled/broiled. ÊThe marinated teriyaki steak was also pretty good. ÊI am not a teriyaki fan so I am biased. ÊI've sampled and had other dishes but I don't specifically remember them. ÊTherefore this review is part useless. ÊI do remember the desserts however. ÊDEFINITELY TRY the Mango Tapioca pudding. ÊThis is my favorite dish at the House (besides the cock and balls). ÊI wish I could bathe in this stuff. ÊMango ice cream was good. ÊThe apple cobbler and blueberry bread pudding was decent. ÊI still devoured them all. Ê Definitely give the house a try.

If only to have one thing at The House, it would be the Tempura Lobster Salad. ÊNot always offered, but when they do have it in their specials, it is a must try. ÊAnother great appetizer item that is always on their menu is the blue lake tempura green beans. Delicious. Favorite entree choice: the black cod. ÊIt is also offered as a special, but it comes prepared beautifully with a California roll on top. An entree that comes with its own appetizer? One please! The ahi tuna is always a solid choice as is the pork chop. The mushroom rice with shrimp would not be one of my favorites. Although the shrimp was excellent, the rice was lacking in flavor and had a bit too many mushrooms. But, to be fair, the menu did clearly list MUSHROOM rice with prawns. Overall, a great place to go for a delicious splurge (~$30-$40/person with appetizers).

Thank you Christine C., thank you Marc A., thank you Jason G...thank you for recommending this great spot. There is no point arguing with the sea bass. ÊJust give in. ÊAmazingly good. ÊOf course, I followed the advice of my most trusted yelpers and went with the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. ÊThe worst part of the sea bass was swallowing it, because it meant each unbelievably awesome bite was gone. ÊIt was smooth as butter. ÊUgh, I'm going to be thinking sea bass tonight. ÊActually, I didn't appreciate the garlic soy as much. ÊI thought it was unnecessary and just masked the flavor of the fresh fish. ÊAs an aside, it's the same problem I have with putting ketchup on a great burger. ÊDon't mess with it. ÊThe veggies were also cooked perfectly. ÊThe noodles? ÊWell, they were fine. ÊMy wife had the Grilled blue fin tuna with spicy mustard aioli. ÊThat was also very good, although it was a little too salty than I would otherwise prefer. ÊThe calamari appetizer was okay. ÊAdmittedly, it was a safe choice and I should have picked something more creative. ÊExtra points for great presentation. I wasn't crazy about the lack of elbow room. ÊThen again, I don't think it's their fault that they have a fairly small place. ÊIt was a little awkward to have a cozy conversation when you have a couple on either side. ÊNoise level was a little high. ÊWe liked our server, but we were not too happy with the lady who got us our seats. ÊWhatev, maybe she was having a tough day. Thanks to yelp, I found out about awesome places like these. ÊSeriously, try the sea bass.

I must start off this review by saying they serve THE BEST grilled sea bass hands down. Without. A. Doubt. Okay. Onto my review. This place is surprisingly small. Tables are tucked very close together. I was able to listen to my neighbors' entire conversation. You get these white paper place mats with a tiny cut out of a house. It's a simple touch but it gave quite the impression. There wasn't much decor to this place. Very simple and plain. The food must be good because the place was never empty and there was always a group of people waiting for a table. The House attracts a pretty diverse crowd. I was really impressed. Don't let the website fool you. It may look cheap as hell but the food more than makes up for it. They have specials that are not on the menu and I remember every darn thing the waitress was reading off sounding really tempting. I was getting overwhelmed by all the choices I had which I surprisingly all liked. My friend had mentioned they make the best sea bass so I decided to go with that. Hopefully the next time I come back they'll still have the black miso cod. The sea bass was really thick and juicy. Just judging by it first glance, it would look like it was grilled so black that the fish was probably hard. The second that first bite hit my mouth it was as if I was in heaven. The fish literally melted in my mouth. It was really juicy and buttery. It was cooked perfectly. I don't have one bad thing to say about it except there should've been more of it! It was served with green beans and the warm wasabi house noodles. It also came with this sweet garlic soy sauce that I poured over the green beans. It tasted like something you order at a Chinese restaurant. Don't get too happy with the sauce or it'll get salty. For dessert, we got the red velvet cake. Oh dear my. The presentation was awesome. The cake was very soft and moist but the cream cheese is what got me. It had just a small hint of sourness but it was mostly sweet. Sometimes the cheese and the cake can be a little too sweet but The House made it perfect so it would complement eachother. Neither component overpowered the other. The House definitely did not disappoint one person in our party. Each dish had their own specific flavor. Not one of them tasted the same. Make sure you make reservations a few days before. We called the day before and the only earliest time they had available was 9:30PM. The service was very friendly and efficient. Prices were surprisingly lower than what we were expecting which makes this place even better! We couldn't have asked for anything better at The House.

Great place for lunch (dinner is a bit too expensive). Loved the Unagi Avocado sammy ($10 comes with salad). Curry noodles with shrimp ($8.50) were good, but needed some salt; addition of soy sauce helped a lot. Good toothsome noodles. Fried salmon roll ($7.50) was amazing. DO NOT MISS IT. It comes with a very tasty asian "coleslaw". They have a good selection of beer (Chamay, Duvel, Czechvar etc.) and tea. Very good service, too.

For my amazing 200th review, remarkably a place that lived up to its reputation! We came, we ate, and we were conquered. The House as it were, was smallish for a group of 7 that expanded into 9 but quite cozy, if we had one more person, I would have had to vacate to the bathroom or sat on my friend's husband's lap, which would have had me drawn and quartered or been my best birthday present...go figure... For appetizers, we ordered the Maine Crab Cake with Pickled Ginger Remoulade (wow, it had spicy black roe), Caesar Salad with Crispy Bay Scallops (the scallops disappeared by the time it came to my end of the table...drat!), and the Classic Fried Calamari (the sauce was good!) All of which were nicely plated and quickly served! Excellent! For main meals, we got: Sesame Soy Glazed Salmon In a Bonito Sake Broth Êwith spicy mustard greens topped with tobiko roe. I loved everything except the spicy mustard greens. After eating it day after day, that's the first I had to trade off with my friends dish...hello...I don't do leafy greens! The ever popular Grilled Sea Bass with Garlic Ginger Soy with mashed veggie potatoes and green beans...was like flakey butter! It was fierce! Steve R. had Warm Wasabi House Noodles with Angus Flatiron Steak...I couldn't mooch off him to taste so I can't comment, but apparently an empty plate says it all. Grilled Ahi Tuna (rare) with Spicy Mustard Aioli was Dan's choice and what a choice! It was perfectly prepared...not a fan of spice but he really dug the flavors. Joy P and Daphne had split on Dry-aged Black Angus Rib Eye Steak with Teriyaki Glaze, Roasted garlic butter with a side of seaweed topped white rice (sooo not Uncle Ben's)...if they could have licked the plate, it would be squeaky clean. For dessert we had the gamut of Mango tapioca (not like the sweet confections of other Chinese restaurants...they had big balls of tapioca...and I love my big balls!!!), Sweet blueberry bread pudding with a side of vanilla ice cream (it was okay, not eye popping like the others), bittersweet chocolate cream cake (that was delicious), and apple pie a la mode with ice cream (it was sooo warm and gooey) and lastly a special that had peach crisps with a side of vanilla ice cream...that was the BOMB! Service was exceptional and polite...even when we had the unexpected add ons of people, they were unfailingly eager to help. They switched out silverware for every course and gave us no grief when we had to order special sides for our picky eaters. Parking is nowhere to be had, and if you are a parking Nazi then maybe you'll luck out, but go to the Vallejo parking garages for a stress free drop off. Believe me...you don't want to fight the nuts out here on a Saturday night. I will definitely be back to try the Niman Ranch Pork Chop with Pomegranate Currant Sauce...it was just too cute to be seen...dang it...why can't I have 4 stomachs like a cow? That way I can eat for days...

One of my personal favorite restaurants @SF. It is probably the only restaurant worthy of my 5 star rating. Great fusion place. Portions are large and taste just right. Good wine selection. Minor downside to House is the size of the restaurant. It can get a bit crowded. Here's a link to their menu http://bit.ly/6rTKq8. I am not sure how recent it is but my personal favorites are: seabass, curry noodles & ribs. Don't bother looking for parking... just suck it up and park in some lot.

five star food and ambiance for a three to four star price means this place is both a wonderful experience and a GREAT deal! fiance and i came here based on the recommendation of an SF aficionado and tried everything that was highly recommended: deep fried salmon roll: had no idea what these would be like, but they were AMAZING. an entire roll, sliced into triangles of crispy, salmon buttery goodness: the sea bass: melt in your mouth, perfect consistency. :) i also like the sweet/salty udon noodles that accompanies this dish the wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak: this was less impressive to me, and next time i'd try something else like the pork chop. i thought the wasabi house noodles would be phenomenal based on reviews, but i actually liked the udon noodles that came with the sea bass better. the deep fried pickles that i mistakenly took as peppers were a great accompaniment to the dishes! the food and presentation are lovely, as was the service - i'd definitely come back. :)

This restaurant is home to my very favorite "taste of the year" (June 2004 - May 2005), meaning that of all food I tried for the first time last year, The House's sea bass left everything else in its dust. This sea bass is the most tender, succulent fish I've ever had. It comes with great sides as well (like the garlic noodles on our second visit), and was so good I had it on my birthday and Valentine's Day. If you're ever in San Diego, Michael's Grill in Santee serves a similar dish that's not quite as good but still spectacular and only $11.

Well went on the advice of almost 600 yelpers looking for something new and adventurous to try for my daughter's boyfriend's birthday dinner.. We were running a bit late due to the bridge being backed up with traffic on a Saturday night (guess we should have left earlier with the Giants game playing too). But called the restaurant and told them we'd be 15 minutes late and they were appreciative that we called and said that was fine. The House is small and our table was in the back. That was probably the only down point of the dinner, it was so dark back there we couldn't see our menus. A candle would have helped! We started with a salmon skin roll, prawns and a crab cake( that was amazing!) all wonderful. Then we each tried different entrees I had the special that night Halibut, amazing and cooked perfect. Served over wild mushrooms and mashed potatoes. My husband had a Salmon in a soy sesame glaze, also cooked to perfection (loved the sweet caramelized flavor). My daughter went for the tri-tip Angus steak and mashed potatoes( I know its and Asian themed restaurant, but I deprived her of beef as a child since I don't cook beef or pork at home) Her portion looked huge and she said it was wonderful. Her boyfriend had prawns over a mushroom rice, and when it arrived at the table the rice was so thin and warm it was curling in the dish (moving!) Entertaining to say the least.... Then we shared a bittersweet chocolate cake and a apple crumble with vanilla ice cream (that was killer!). So the service was good though its hard to hear Êwhen they were reading off the specials, and being in the dark was kind of a drag.But all in all the meal was amazing and I would definitely go back!

Yes, it is tight. But then again isn't every other place in SF? It's a small city, we can't fight geography. Ideally a dish should be creative AND well-exectued. Take the creative out and you are half way there. Dishes here are not the most creative but god do they taste delicious and are prepared properly. Presentation is wonderful. Skip the menu, go straight to the specials. Like a few other places in SF, it sets the standard for what a family-run restaurant should be like. Husband and wife allied to strive and offer the best. They are some of the best hosts in town. Have been here from one to one dinners to 20-people party. Always treated the same. They are not even on Open Table, but booked every night just by word of mouth. That should mean somehting. The location throws me off, it's tourist-central yet locals "in-the-know" all come here. Conclusion? "Asian-fusion" can be a million different things, but their interpretation is still among the best in the city. Hidden gem. You shouldn't miss it.

not a fan of asian fusion, but this place is great (and popular) positive: exquisitely cooked seabass, juicy, absolutely delicious. negative: ginger soy sauce is unnecessary, fish is already cooked/flavored perfectly more contrast is needed with the greens and noodles, subtlety often lost in fusion dishes positive: porkchop in pomegranite currant -- beautiful presentation with very tasty sauce negative: very strong on the flavors, could balance it with something more light. roasted unagi--ok but pretty mainstream. ÊI usually like the menu to be a little more adventurous, but definitely an extra star for presentation. Êalso, the place is quite cramped. if you're having trouble finding parking, be sure to use the north beach garage near vallejo and stockton.

Service was great. ÊThe hostess was able to quickly accomodate our seating to include 2 more people. ÊThe space is modern minimalist and not too Asian-y. The food is the real star here though. ÊShrimp and mango salad, asparagus, salmon rolls and ahi tartare were all done well. ÊWasabi noodles with flat iron steak was smoky, slighlty spicy and not too greasy. ÊSeared ahi simply melted on my tongue like buttah baybee! Our server was prompt, attentive, nice and I think very pregnant! ÊIt's all good. Go there Êand share some small plates with a bottle of pinot.

came here with a date for dinner a couple weeks ago. off the bat, parking is a pain in the ass, but i guess that's expected for dining in the city. the place is actually a bit hard to find, no lighted signs and the place really is laid back and unassuming. honestly, i knew i was going to hate the experience right when i walked in. the place is TINY, which makes every conversation in the restaurant a shouting match between tables because the place is so cramped. they really need to take out a couple tables to add some space to walk. i couldn't give 5-stars because of this. otherwise, i thought the food was very good. we started with the deepfried salmon roll with chinese mustard. salmon was fried on the outside and raw on the inside, tasted like awesome fried sashimi with wasabi, serving was huge. the date had wasabi noodles with flat-iron steak, a pretty cool asian-fusion idea. i had the kobe with mashed potatoes and mushrooms. wow was this good, although there was nothing "asian fusion" about it. overall: service was good, nothing of note. great food at good size servings at a decent price for a night out. wouldn't take a hot date here, however, unless you don't want to do any talking during dinner ;)

the house is my favorite asian fusion restaurant ever!! Êi usually don't like asian fusion too much being asian but this is one of my favorite restaurants where i will keep coming back! i recommend their deep fried salmon rolls, they're are really good! their pork chops with the pomegranate sauce is the best~ Êtoo bad they only have it for dinner! their grilled sea bass is cooked perfectly! very moist! their place is a little small and i would definitely recommend getting reservations or else you probably won't get a table.

Food: some aggressive asian fusion dishes otherwise standard Ambiance: simple decor, real estate very limited Service: excellent, very attentive People: polite but noses held high we were walk-ins and were seated within 15 mins, which really caught me off guard considering it was for dinner on a friday night. i expected to wait longer. ordered unagi sushi rice and salmon roll as appetizers or small dishes as they call it. unagi was good, well prepared and lightly covered with the typical unagi sauce. what i did not like was the bonito flakes scattered atop the unagi roll look-a-like. these bonito flakes had numerous fish bones which was a major turn off. i didnt want to ruin the experience for my friend who was having unagi for the first time so i didnt send it back and tried to discretely remove some of the flakes. the salmon roll on the other hand was all that it had lived up to be. texture of salmon was moist and flavorful. salmon was wrapped in nori and deep fried. there was another layer of flavor in the wrap that i could not put my finger on. the chinese mustard sauce was a perfect dipping sauce compared to the usual wasabi and soy sauce i was expecting. it was much stronger than wasabi and had that extra kick of asian spice to it. the salmon roll was resting on a bed of sweet and spicy cabbage and company which was great. entrees were good. i ordered the sea bass with garlic soy noodles and green beans. sea bass melts in your mouth and slightly charred on the surface. not overly seasoned but yet not under seasoned to a point where you are left with a fishy after taste. green beans tasted as if they were fresh from grandmas garden but noodles were just ordinary. noodle portion was minimal but since it was just ordinary i didnt mind. dish came with a dipping sauce that was extremely salty. a little dab to my sea bass can only be described as sodium overflow. dessert should be avoided, well the desserts we ordered should be. we got the mango tapioca and coconut creme brulee with a drizzle of passion fruit puree. the tapicoa was hidden in a thick layer of creme and the mango was very subtle. this dish should have been called hidden mango creme. the brulee also was subtle with its coconut, in fact even more subtle than the mango which would make it almost non-existent. the major buzz kill was the passion fruit puree! we found ourselves doing the duck face as we sampled this dessert. very sour that it conflicted with the sweetness of the creme brulee. a mismatch indeed. staff as mentioned was great. our place settings were always cleaned and cleared throughout the meal. they were very accommodating and allowed my friend to customize an entree without hesitation. overall my experience was great and i would definitely comeback.

I came here in a group of four for a family-style dinner. We ordered the following, ranked from the most- to least-favorite based on a group consensus (items not on menu are marked "special"): Appetizers ($6-8 each): 1) *special* Grilled scallops - Wonderful consistency and seasoning. The scallops themselves were lightly-seared with a semi-raw center, herb-crusted, topped with micro greens, and complimented with a light sauce I no longer remember. 2) Steamed mussels - I'm generally not a fan of mussels, since I think oysters have a more interesting consistency and clams have a less pungent iodine odor. Here, they managed to cook them to a soft perfection, and the abundant broth that comes with the order totally masks their innate fishiness. Honestly, it's like mussels reinvented to capitalize on their light texture, with a novel taste added to boot. The dish was also very well portioned. 3) Deep-fried salmon roll - I was surprised to find that the salmon was intact rather than ground. The "crab legs" presentation was very creative and helps make this dish into fun finger food. The sweet mustard-soy sauce dip was intense and energizing. Still, I felt that this appetizer was the least special. The concept is fantastic, but the taste is just "good" in comparison. Entrees ($18-24 each) 1) Pork Chop - this is one of those dishes that you can tell was just PERFECTED. Everything was just right here. The pomegranate-cranberry sauce tasted ridiculously smooth and complex. The flavor was almost indescribable - with opposite characteristics like fruitiness and smokiness blended together seamlessly. Combined with the perfectly-cooked pork chop, it was heaven. This dish was by far the best integration of flavors I have ever experienced. 2) *special* Slow cooked pork butt - This dish almost ties the pork chop for number one, and I think if the chef tweaks with the sauce a bit, can potentially surpass it. I loved the addition of coagulated blood on top of the meat. The rich, fatty flavor was perfect when combined with the more stringy meat. The miso sauce was an excellent addition, but could have been less watery. The napa cabbage was soaked in the stuff and made the perfect veggie side for the meat. There was also a mild smokiness to it that I loved. 3) Sea Bass - Extremely hyped-up and slightly disappointing, though still excellent. For those who've had good-quality steamed whole fish at Chinese restaurants before, the texture here won't be overly special. Still, this was the selling point. The meat was just flaky enough, and still held together well. The soy sauce dip could stand to be improved. It was essentially a strong teriyaki sauce, as pungent as it is straight from the grocery store. Both the ginger and the fish were overwhelmed by this. 4) *special* Short Ribs - Korean-style, without the bone. At least this is what I remember hearing. The item appeared more like flatiron steak or another lean cut to me though. Taste and texture-wise, there was nothing to complain about. If you like korean marinade, you will love this: it has just the right amount of flavor and marinade essence, and the meat was perfectly-cooked. However, it doesn't have the flair and originality of the other dishes. At the end of the day, we all know what this one "should" taste like. The wasabi noodles were good, but the flavor was strong and so my instinct was to eat it separately, not with the meat. Dessert ($5-8 each): 1) Chocolate cake: a must have. This was by far the best among the sweets. The cake itself was extremely dense, with the right kind of chocolate richness - not too much sugar, just the right amount of bitterness and tang, and balanced between smooth and brittle. Hot damn. I love chocolate and this is as good as it gets. Fuck those expensive truffles. Nothing beats this cake. 2) Mango tapioca: I was expecting a jello from the look of it, but it's actually a thick pudding. The mango flavor being subtle was a tremendous strength here, helping to bring the creaminess and barely-discernible texture of the tapioca out. The final effect is a taste that is both rich and light. 3) Apple cobbler: My friend is a huge apple pie fan and was not too fond of this. I thought the cinnamon flavor and apple texture/sweetness was perfect. A lot of times, the syrup is too runny or sweet, and it was definitely not the case here. The crust was good, but not good enough. Like the chocolate cake, this came with an appropriate scoop of ice cream. 4) Creme brulee: haha, shit! The passion fruit syrup poured on top was way overpowering. I'm sure it has its uses in its own right, but the intensity of the sweetness and sourness was way too much. The creme brulee itself was passable. We ended up paying 57/person for 4 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 4 desserts, including some non-alcoholic drinks. Was it worth it? Absolutely. The House easily had some of the best food I've ever tasted, and like most here, I proudly stand behind my experience.

Based on a few friends recommendations, I took my cousin here to celebrate her bday. ÊI was truly excited to try this place out after checking out pics of the food online and hearing the rave, rave review from friends! It was an extremely rainy evening the nite we went so the drive from the East Bay to the City took much longer than planned. ÊTo be polite, we called the resto to let them know we were running late. ÊNeedless to say, I had to drop my cousin off because it took me another 25 minutes to find parking. ÊParking in this area during prime dinner hour (7pm) is THE WORST! Given that the resto is in North Beach, I expected the space to be small and small it was. ÊAgree with another Yelper - I would not recommend this place for parties or groups of more than 4 as it is a very tight squeeze between tables. Food was VERY good, but oddly enough that is not what left an impression on me. ÊIt was part of our service (our waitress) that was not-so-good. ÊWhen I finally got into the resto, my cousin mentioned how she apologized to the staff for our tardiness and that I was parking the car. Ê10 minutes into looking for parking, I called my cousin (already seated at a table) and told her to order 2 appetizers to get our meal going. ÊMy intention was to shore up time we lost by arriving late. ÊApparently, when she ordered the appetizers the server made some snide comment about 'this being the reason why they do not like to seat people if the entire party is not present." ÊFrom that point on the service by this waitress (Asian gal, didn't get her name) sucked eggs. ÊShe took our food order and seemed to rush off, she didn't come back to check on us and while I was ordering dessert...I had not yet fnished ordering and she already walked away to tend to another table. ÊTo top it off, I watched her wait on other tables to the left & right of us and she was extremely courteous and helpful to them, but whenever she was at our table the charade was dropped. LOOK...we called to say we were late, we even ordered appetizers to get the meal going even though I was not present AND we are paying customers like everyone else. ÊWe don't need to be treated like royalty, but we deserved the same respect and courtesy everyone else was afforded. ÊWe were contrite, apologetic customers who were trying to help this waitress out by being prepared whenever she was at our table and did our best to not linger at the table because we could see you had customers lined up at the door. ÊUnfortunately her panties remained in a fat bunch from the moment we arrived late. Needless to say, I am no longer excited about this place. ÊAs good as the food was, you will NEVER find me returning to this establishment because of THAT stinkin' waitress. P.S. ÊYeah, I probably should have complained to the mgmt, but I guess I didn't want to deal with it that nite. ÊInstead, I've chosen to put them on blast via Yelp.

One of my dearest friends works for Yelp and recommended this restaurant. We went with a reservation for our group, which was key as this place is packed on weekend (and a lot of week) nights. We had a group of six and decided that since everything looked SO good we would each order something different so we could try everything on the menu. I had a special that evening- monk fish. So good. ÊOther dishes included a veal special, the Sea Bass, which is a staple to their menu and incredible! Tuna dish, salmon dish, all amazing. Tuna tar tare app was awesome. I had the raw oysters as an appetizer which were wonderful. Desserts could not be beat. Over all, this restaurant serves some of the best food I've had in my three years living in the bay area. I loved it so much I took my mom here last time she visited from Boston, and she was totally wowed by the incredible food served here.

Another great find thanks to Yelp. ÊI wanted to save the House for a special occasion because I knew they must have something special if despite its size and the wait people continue to come and leave raving about the place. ÊI made dinner reservations for two on a Saturday at 7:00pm so I expected to wait around and actually eat at around 7:30-7:45...and I was correct. ÊWe checked in with the hostess at around 6:55 and didn't get seated until 7:40. ÊThis was pretty much anticipated, though. ÊOnce a large group of 10 left, the rest of us at the door were seated rather promptly. ÊThe hostess was very apologetic and personable and we were sat towards the back in a cozy table. ÊOur waitress could've been a *leeeeetle* bit friendlier but she gave us the specials of the night and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. ÊWe decided on the curried white shrimp wiht mango salad for appetizer, the flat iron steak and wasabi noodles for him, and grilled sea bass with garlic noodles for me. ÊThe appetizer was very nicely presented and the flavors worked really well together but came with two shrimps. ÊThe shrimps were succulent and done perfectly which is probably why I think it would've been better if they were a little more generous with it, esp if they were charging $9 for the salad. ÊI think I'll try another appetizer next time for variety and maybe better deal. ÊThe bf's flat iron steak came perfect at medium and worked so well with the wasabi noodles, but it was a good thing that I got the sea bass because my noodles were a little better (no powerful taste of wasabi) and the sauce (sesame soy glaze) went well with both the fish and the steak. ÊThe green beans, although simple, was a good complement to the fish and noodles. ÊSimply put, The House (and Dragonfly over in the Richmond district) is Asian fusion at its best. ÊAtmosphere was loud and lively and the place was indeed a little cramped but personally I didn't think it took away from the experience. ÊOur busboy, hostess, and the other waiter were all very friendly and suggested excellent dishes and specials for the night. ÊThe table next to us seemed to not like their wine at all and our waitress gave them some lip about it being a matter of personal taste and preference. ÊBut I thought she should've just brought out another wine instead....not a big deal. ÊWe almost went somewhere else for dessert but I am SO glad we didnt because their apple crumb pie a la mode is just to die for. ÊBut I did find a piece of hair wedged in it.....ughhh.... but since they were running out of the pie I didn't want them to bring out another one so I just braved it and ate the rest anyway. ÊI love you, the House, but that piece of hair and our less than personable waitress took a star away from you. ÊBut good news is, I'm willing to go back very soon and give you another shot and maybe....just maybe I'll give you that last star : ) And I wouldnt suggest coming here in a group larger than 6.

A solid 4.5 restaurant. This place is fantastic, simply because they know how to make everything tasty. Usually Asian fusion doesn't fill you up because its all about presentation and high prices. Yeah sure, this place has plenty of presentation and a pretty high price but it definitely leaves your stomach satisfied. I had the Niman Ranch pork chops which were delicious and extremely tender, the amazing pomegranate currant sauce was the icing on the meat (haha). I'd recommend the grilled sea bass and the angus ribeye steak, that always pleases the taste buds. I always get the creme brulee here simply because I am a fan of great creme brulee but one thing that you have to do is ask for the sauce on the side. They top the creme brulee with a passionfruit puree which is sour to an intensity that you will cringe to its sharp taste. Nevertheless an amazing restaurant and it deserves nothing less than five stars. One improvement I would like to see is that the waitresses smile once in a while. I mean they look trained to be in the military except they memorize daily specials rather than the army general orders.

I love everything from the soft ginger seabass to the little house cutouts they have on the placemat. ÊThe house is a small restaurant with modern yet calming decor near broadway. ÊThe food? ÊWell, we started with appetizers. ÊCalamari, slightly above par with others I have tried. ÊCrabcake, full of flavors and doesn't sink to heavily on your stomach. ÊMMmmm now the good stuff, Flat iron steak with wasabi noodles. ÊSteak was very tender, very flavorful; paired with the wasabi noodles, creates a very bold dish with hints of spicyness. ÊThe Garlic Ginger seabass was amazing. ÊThe seabass was soft and fluffy in texture. ÊDipped in garlic ginger soy, this fish has some mean flavor. Sounds good enough for you? try it out, make sure you call for reservations.

California- Home of Asian Fusion Cusine. California - Also home of Sterotypical, Poorly Executed Asian Fusion Cusine. Went to House this weekend, expecting to find your typical asian fusion cuisine (tuna tartare, soy/balsamic reduction sauces, saketini, etc.). I came out of the restaurant suprised and very satisfied. We (3 people) started off with the bbq chipotle grilled oysters with cilantro. Bbq sauce was a little strong for the briney oyster, but you can't go wrong with fresh oysters. Then we shared 3 entrees (seared tuna, grilled sea bass, and the porkchop). The seared tuna and sea bass was very typical. Served with an asian sauce (soy/ginger and chinese mustard sauce) it was tasty but easily forgetable. The pork chop however was on another level. Grilled to a perfect medium (slightly pink center), it was served with an amazing sauce of currant/pomegranate reduction. The pork was also topped off with more pomegranate seeds. The smoky charred pork with the sweet reduction made a very standard sounding dish (pork w/ a sweet reduction) taste extraordinary. Service was a 2-3 stars (very busy, slow). Space was cramped, but that pork blew me away. I would come back to the restaurant (horrible parking) just for that one dish alone.

LOVE..... LOVE this place! I've been here twice (so far) and I totally fell in LOVE with The House ever since the first time... So far, I tasted: -Calamari as an appetizer (5/5) Not that hard to mess up.. I don't think.. -Angus ribeye steak (4.5/5) It has their housemade teriyaki with toasted garlic butter. ÊI love the taste of the seasoning; however, BOTH times, there are too much fat on it, which is pratically 1/3 of the whole steak. -Grilled ahi tuna (rare) with spicy mustard aioli (5/5) The ahi tuna was so fresh, it melted and dissolved in your mouth.... Not to mention the sauce was delicious too! - Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy (5/5) The sea bass was sooooo soft and yummy... It is a little pricy Êfor what it is but it's def. worth of every penny and your taste bud will appreciate it too. ÊI always recommend ALL my friends and family to go here when they are in SF. This is a MUST place to dine- in . Keep in mind that you SHOULD make a reservation since it does get pack pretty fast; otherwise, you NEED to come 10 minutes before the restaurant opens so they can seat you right away before it gets too full.

after all the hype, i was slightly underwhelmed. i had lunch, so perhaps it's better for dinner. deep fried salmon roll was great, but the portions were on the small side. i guess i expect a lot of quantity for asian food. maybe i was just hungry for more. the ramen was also nice. i would try it again. the flavors were all great, but i wasn't emotionally satisfied..

While traveling for a trade show, I met with a friend for dinner. She made reservations for a place called simply, the house (yes, lower case). ÊIt was a an Asian fusion menu. We both had a local Pinot Noir which was smooth and full in flavor, and we washed down our appetizer, which was the fried Calamari with a side of sesame salad. I am usually not a fan of the squidders, but this was well worth it. We followed our app with our entrees. I ordered the Grilled Mahi and mussels (spicy and tender), while my friend order the Blackened Cod. Her meal was out of this world. We then finished off the meal with a couple desserts that we shared. We had the apple/blueberry cobbler and the creme brulee with the toasted crispy glaze. Overall, this food was scrumptious and the service by our waitress, named Summer, was superlative to say the least. If in the Golden Gate city. Stop in and enjoy. Don't miss this one! Everything was exceptional, but the price was a bit steep.

Not enough space. ÊMy wife weighs about 100 lbs and was expected to shimmy between two tables to reach the banquette. ÊOur son and I are both way too big to even attempt it. Not fat, just big (6'3", 175-200 lbs). ÊNeither table could be easily moved. As it was, her tiny ass practically brushed another party's stemware. Ridiculous. During the meal, our server spilled cream all over the table. No big whup, but I mention it in light of the cramped environment. Perhaps the most annoying thing was we were seated adjacent to a couple of largemouthed lawyers, alternatively rehashing cases and flirting with one another, oblivious to other diners. With regular spacing, I'd barely notice, but their proximity here bordered on nauseating. Ê The food's inventive and pretty and I dont have too much to add. The black cod looked succulent but my $25 halibut & mussels "special" was good, not great. ÊThe fish was slightly overdone and only three mussels accompanied it. We enjoyed the crispy salmon rolls. In addition to the printed menu, they recited seven oral "specials" - three apps and four entrees - each with three or four elements. ÊWho am I, Billy Britannica? I couldnt assimilate all that. Ê Service is okay, reasonably polite, but not quite as sharp as I'd expect in a bistro with this reputation. It's pretty clear the emphasis is on the fusion delights, and they'd prefer you eat, pay a hundred dollars and get out.

i came here for a birthday dinner with my family. Êwe had reservations for 6:30 on a Saturday, unaware that the chinese new year parade was occurring that night. Êi called ahead to the house to inform them that we might be late, and rushed to the restaurant to make sure our table wasn't given away. Êmy dad was unable to find parking immediately and didn't get to the place until 7:20. Êthe hostess had informed me when i arrived that she needed the table back by 8, so we ordered our apps and mains quickly to try to finish by 8. Ê we finished around 8:10 and were promptly given the check. Êconfused, we tried to order dessert (since it was my birthday after all) and were DENIED the dessert menu because it was already past 8. Êi understand that it is a tiny place, and it is important to the reputation of the restaurant to honor their reservations. Êbut i don't think that customers should ever be treated as a nuisance and denied food because of situations that are out of their control, especially if they're already spending $164 on a meal here. the food was quite good (the sea bass is the reason for the extra star), so it is unfortunate that i left with such a bad taste in my mouth and exceeding embarrassment for making my dad drive all the way from sacramento (and my brother drive all the way from santa cruz) only to be rushed and kicked out of a restaurant. Êfor my birthday. ÊHAPPY BIRTHDAY!

For anyone reading this...it is my first review ever on Yelp, so if I do not do the place justice, I apologize in advance. I went here last night for the second time and enjoyed both the atmosphere and the excellent cuisine. The only unfortunate part was that they did not have their trademark black cod which I had heard so much about. Instead, I had the sea bass and the risotto. Both were succulent, flavorful and looked absolutely mouth-watering. The shrimp were moist and had a spiceful kick to it. The bass seemed to flow on the palette and was buttery and sweet. Eating with a serious "yelper" who had highly recommended the place, I am pleased to say that I was definitely not dissapointed. To finish off dinner, we had this artistically glazed COCONUT creme brulee. Being a coconut afficiando myself, I will also say that it was a highlight of the meal. Overall, I would definitely give this place a thumbs up.

The bf never fails me when it comes to matters of the stomach. I couldn't have asked for a better place to satisfy my hunger after sweating my butt off in cardio kick-boxing last night. I was surprised to see how Êpacked the place was on a Tuesday evening. Reservations are recommended! Every dish not only tasted good but was visually presented well also. Appetizer: He ordered the Kobe beef salad special (medium rare per chef's order), which had a blend of greens, sauces and meat that was so tender it made our taste buds jump for joy. I had the Ahi tuna Tartar that was cupped by light crispy chips Ê(arranged in a star shape) and veggies and topped with caviar as a finishing touch. I looked like a ravaging animal as my fork kept going from my plate to his. Ê Dinner: He ordered the grilled sea bass, which came with string beans, garlic noodles and a tasty dipping sauce. The sea bass was so light and fluffy it was grilled to perfection. I had the short ribs special, which came without the bone. It was the most delicious short ribs I've ever tasted in my life. It was crispy on the edges and the rest seemed to melt in Êmy mouth. I hope my waitress didn't think I was a cave woman as my mouth was so full and busy when she came to ask me if everything was alright that I couldn't even answer her. Dessert: Apple pie Ala mode. The apples were so fresh (they bake it fresh every morning) and the pie crumbles had the perfect crumbly/slightly crispy texture. All this with the ice cream, I'm glad the bf got full before me so I had most of the dessert to myself. Or else I would have ordered another one. The waitress was quick, prices weren't too shabby but most importantly the food was to die for. I'm definitely coming back! ÊAs for parking, we parked in a garage around the corner. Ten dollars for the night.

Okay, so this place doesn't really need my review. But I feel the need to review it anyway. This place was awesome. I went with a group of 6, and everyone enjoyed their dishes. They have a dizzying list of specials (shouldn't specials be limited to 3-4 dishes rather than about 10? One hint that you have too many specials is the number of times each table asks you to repeat the entire list. But I digress). I ordered the black cod special - HIGHLY recommended. I always like black cod, but this was exceptionally prepared with a wasabi and soy-mixture sauce. So tender and juicy. I also had the half dozen oysters - solid, but next time I may think twice about ordering oysters the night before I have to catch a flight.

Parking is hard to find so i suggest arriving early. The restaurant itself is also very small and cramped but the food is well worth it. Delicious. I had the Angus steak, my boyfriend had the pork chops and we shared the mussel appetizer. I must say it was sooo delectable. We went on a Sunday night when it wasn't so busy so it was a nice dinner. Our waiter was on point and attentive. She announced several dinner specials to perfection with such detail. I would definitely not be able to remember any of that if i was your waiter. I bow down to that. Ê The steamed mussels were so good. The sauce in itself was yum. After we finished the mussels we spooned the broth cause it was soo good. Our main courses arrived shortly after and those were just as good too. My boyfriend had the juiciest pork chops I've ever tried (most of the time at other restaurants they tend to be overcooked and dry). The currant sauce was sweet and delicious. I dipped some of my steak into it cause it was tantalizing. My Angus steak was yum. it was also juicy and filled with flavor. Overall it was a good dining experience. It left us full but wanting more. The price was right for the food we ate. I enjoyed it. I continued to eat here and now my favorite is the pork chop.

We came here on a weekday for lunch around 1. When we first got there, the place was pretty empty, but quickly filled up with the lunch crowd. We shared the deep-fried salmon roll, which came with a delicious horseradishy dipping sauce, and for entrees we got the warm wasabi house noodles, the curry noodles, and the pork chop with pomegranate sauce (which normally isn't offered for lunch, but the chef made for us anyway!) Definitely recommend the salmon roll, wasabi noodles, and pork chop - the curry noodles were so-so, the sauce was a little too thick for my liking. Also, love their place mats with the cute hole punched into it in the shape of a house!

will try to update this later.....but most likely never hehe, i'll to go in as much detail as possible for now :D ordered their sea bass, the wasabi noodles, and soft shell crab special the soft shell crab in my opinion was the best dish out of the three. mainly because i like fried stuff a lot and the sauce it came with was out of this universe! that's right universe, not world ;p It was that amazing! It used those green hot pepers, cilantro, and it had like some kind of sweet sauce in it and was kind of salsa like sea bass is always good no matter where you go and it was not anything that special. the sauce it came with though was good as well, but not that memorable the wasabi noodles was very good, but mainly because i have never had this type of noodle before and we ordered the flatiron steak that came with it medium rare. it was a little chewy, so i recommend getting it medium here. just depends on the restaurant as they all cook it different ya know?? or maybe you don't know ;p presentation: 4.3 stars food: 4.7 stars difficult parking means coming back here often will be hard: 2.7 stars service/waiter: he had a good sense of humor and served us very well, probably refilling my glass of water like 4 times, 4.5 stars for him atmosphere/ambiance: a little romantic, but still not too "couply" (if that's a word ;p), 4 stars total: 4.04 stars =] oh and PS, make reservations if you can! I came on saturday night and it was packed! we got lucky since we showed up around 6pm, so just early enough before all the saturday night crowds came. But even more crazy go lucky! someone who made a reservation never showed up so we got their table, thanks to whoever you are!!! w00t w00t!

My boyfriend and I ordered dinner from here several weeks ago. ÊWe'd eaten there once before and liked their menu because it was a) tasty and b) distinct from the American, French, and Italian cuisine we usually have when we go out. I had a hankering for teriyaki sauce, so I was adamant about getting the roasted unagi with avocado sushi rice for my appetizer. ÊFor my entrŽe, I figured I couldn't go wrong with an angus ribeye steak covered in teriyaki and garlic butter. ÊMy boyfriend, who had the perspicacity to ask about the dinner specials, ordered the Caesar salad with crispy scallops for his appetizer and a kobe steak with udon noodles and mashed potatoes that was not mentioned on the menu. Ê (Note: when ordering from The House, remember to ask about the specials, as there will probably be several good ones on any given night that are not indicated on the menu.) The scallops and unagi were great, but the steaks fell far short of expectations. ÊFor starters, they got cold on the walk between the restaurant and our apartment, and I was too hungry to wait for the three minutes it would have taken to heat them up. ÊThe walk home had also jostled the sauce off the meat; the sauce had collected in the corners of the take-out boxes and refused to re-connect with the steak. ÊWhen I finally started eating, I discovered that my angus was semi-tough and veined with sinewy fat. ÊI tested every part of the cut and spat out every other piece I chewed. ÊThe boyfriend's kobe was only marginally better in terms of fat content, and he ended up sharing it with me. ÊAll in all, our steaks were sub-par by any decent restaurant's standards, and considering what we paid for them, we felt gypped. ÊI think it's safe to say that we'll be avoiding steaks from The House from now on. In spite of our bad experience with the steak, I would still recommend eating at The House as they have some unique, tasty stuff that I haven't seen anywhere else.

after years of hearing about the infamous sea bass dish here, i FINALLY came here for dinner last night for my friend's bday. Êthere were just 2 of us, and we tried a bunch of things. Ê we got three apps: Êa grilled calamari, hamachi sashimi salad, and the salmon egg rolls. Êall of it was soooo good. Êthe salmon egg rolls were delicious and came w/ a chinese hot mustard dipping sauce and a peanut slaw. Êi loved it, b/c the salmon was actually kinda rare. Êthe hamachi sashimi salad was very light and came w/ some greens. Êthe grilled calamari came in a tomatoey like sauce and was very fresh and not chewy at all. onto the entree: Êomg, the seabass is to die for. Êthey give you a gigantic pc, and it comes w/ a side of garlicky chowmein noodles and green beans. Êthere is also a sweet soy dipping sauce, and it was so yummy. Êi will order this everytime i come. Êthe portion is huge. for dessert, we got the choc torte cake w/ a coconut sauce and coffee toffee ice cream. Êthe ice cream had little toffee nibs in it and was fab. Ê this restaurant is tiny so you should definitely make reservations. Êit gets very loud, b/c all the tables are right next to each other. Êservice is super fast. Êw/in 5 minutes of ordering, our apps already came out. Êthere was a service snafu tho, b/c i ordered a glass of wine and it never came. Êby the time the server realized that i never got my wine, we already finished our entree, so i just told her to forget it.

I guess I just have trouble with trendy places. A 9pm reservation doesn't get you a table at 9pm. And I'm not talking about having to wait 5 minutes. They then give you about 3 minutes to look at the menu. The waitress stood next to our table until we made our decision. Then the food arrives way too quickly. I wonder if they know in advance what people will order, and start preparing it even before the order comes in. And, as other people here mentioned, it's way too packed. It's not like you're just listening in on the conversation next to you, you're almost a part of it. Such a busy place, they must have amazing food. Wrong. OK, so most of it was very good, but some was terrible. So why do people come here? Why do they rave about the food on Yelp? Because it's trendy. About the food: some things really worked. For example the fried salmon roll. A piece of salmon, wrapped in sea weed, lightly battered, deep fried for a short time, the salmon being mostly rare inside. Comes with a carrot salad that's pretty good, but also with a sauce that's mostly soy, too salty and too strong, overwhelming the delicate salmon flavour. Other things were just plain wrong. My main course was sea bass, which had some caramelized sugar around it. It's good for a few bites, but then the sweetness and the fatness become annoying, and I didn't want to finish the last bit. This came with some noodles that were very good and some green beens that were not. The only good thing I can say about these green beens was that they weren't overcooked. But besides the fact that they used tasteless vegetables, I'm surprised that they would just plop a bunch of vegetables on a plate like that, not even trying to integrate it into the dish. It looked a lot like food at home. There's nothing wrong with that, but I expected so much more. Again, because of the trendiness.

I walked out and went and ate at Jeanty at Jack's, and now am debating if I should even go back and try this dump at lunch.

I lived in San Francisco for 6 years and moved to Los Angeles 3 years ago. When I travel back to the city there is only one meal I truly crave, Êthe Chilean Sea Bass at The House. I've had this meal a countless number of times and have brought all of my biggest clients to try it... It's so consistent and never a disappointment. In my book it is my favorite meal on Earth! This is not to take away from the rest of the experience. The House is definitely a neighborhood jewel.

I stopped in here for lunch with an old friend. We ordered the fried salmon rolls which were tasty, but I wasn't quite in love with them. I also tried the short ribs that are served with potatoes and beans. The short ribs had an excellent flavor however they were incredibly fatty and I think after all was said and done, I had maybe 2 real bites of meat. The potatoes had a good flavor and the beans were fresh. I would give it 4 stars if I hadn't paid $20 for a lunch and left so hungry.

The food is tasty but they cheat. MSG is in almost everything. If much lower end restaurants like Brandy Ho's advertise "No MSG" with a big sign, one would assume that The House would never use it. But they do, in almost everything. Even the soy sauce has it. The roasted eel. Great. But they cheat by adding MSG. Two items on the menu were MSG free so I had one of them: the sea bass. The green beens had the taste of the container they were in. PVC, plastic, something. Some industrial process packaging taste present with every bite. The wait staff was very nice though. I won't be back.

One of my favorite mainstays of the city - it never fails to impress. A charming outlay that's family run, the asian fusion style is second to none. Not to be lost in detail, even the place mats have small house cut outs on the bottom. For dinner appetizers, the crab cakes and tempura peas are my favorite, and the mushroom soup is a very close runner up. Of the dinners, the cod is always a crowd pleaser, but I am always tempted to order the prawn risotto.

Wow. I do not understand how it is humanly possible that I have not reviewed The House yet. I am infinitely sorry, The House. I promise I still love you and my lack of reviewing has no bearing on how much awe I am in of your food. I have been to The House probably 3 or 4 times, and now that I'm living in SoCal, I miss it so much. The most recent time was on a visit to SF, and we took our amazing friends there to thank them for letting us crash in their living room :). Needless to say, The House, as usual, did not disappoint. My hubby, my friend, and her husband each got a different kind of fish, and I got the wasabi noodles and steak. We all tasted each other's and I have to tell you, EVERYTHING was amazing. I honestly could not pick out a top or a bottom because it truly was all THAT GOOD. The fish was so buttery and perfectly cooked, and my wasabi noodles, standard, were perfectly seasoned and prepared. We also got two appetizers: a crab cake and scallops. Hubby and I split the scallops... and wow. They were unbelievable. I could eat those scallops every. single. day. Our friends really loved their crab cake--not surprising though, as I don't know if The House knows how to make something sub-par. In fact, our friends (who still live in SF--lucky!!) went back to The House recently because they were *that* impressed. They ordered the crab cake again--they liked it that much! Overall, The House has never ever disappointed. It is definitely high quality food for prices that are really reasonable for SF and the quality of food you are receiving. It is not, however, a place where you should go to have a very lengthy, drawn out, romantic meal. They are pleasant, helpful, efficient, and quick... as well as packed, always. So, know that you will come here to eat and visit with your company, and they will not rush you out... but you will leave once you finish your meal. You also MUST have reservations. I'm not sure if they take walk-ins, but we have always gone on a weekend night and if you are going then (Fri/Sat), regardless of the time, MAKE A RESERVATION. You still may need to wait a few minutes when you get there, but don't get annoyed, even though they don't have a real "waiting" area. I promise you, it is worth it.

Except for the sea bass and mango tapioca, nothing really stood out and it's certainly not worth that price. If I wanted to pay that much for a meal I would go to ISA instead. Their French fusion is to die for haha

The noise level was unfortunate, but the food was delicious and very artfully presented. I loved the noodle and risotto (so rich!) entrees, as well as the salad starter. Nice tea selection, too.

Ate here awhile back with my friend Doug, surprised I never got around to writing a review. The food was excellent. I had the salmon, Doug had the Sea bass, which I actually liked way more than my own dish. I am definitely going to order that when I go back there. ÊIt is a small place and waitstaff can be a little intrusive... the food is good so many times they won't let you sit in certain places, even if there is no one in the restaurant yet because of reservations. This is a little gem amongst a plethora of restaurants in touristy North Beach that have absolutely deplorable food. I will definitely be back to The House, but I will remember to make reservations next time!

If someone forced me to pick my favorite restaurant in SF, ÊI'd currently have to say The House. I wish I was loaded so I could eat here three times per week. At least now I live a couple miles away instead of a couple blocks, so it's not constantly taunting me. The atmosphere is nice--just a clean, rather stark interior. (FYI: It can be a bit chilly if you're seated by the door due to the draft, but that's no reason to turn away the table if it's the only one available!). The service has always been friendly and astonishingly speedy every time I've been here. Now for the food. I always call it "Asian Fusion Comfort Food", but I don't even know if that's "accurate." What is accurate, though, is this statement: Just. Fabulous. I'm so obsessed with two of the items on the menu--the Ahi Tuna (or is it Poke?) and the Warm Wasabi Noodles with Flat Iron Steak--that I've only ever tried one other thing once--the calamari (also oustanding, incidentally)...and that was only because the people I went with refused to eat raw fish. Get the poke...seriously. Mmm. I often split the poke and the noodles with a friend, and it's more than enough food (I can never finish the whole entree when I just get that). And always save room for deserts. I've tried many of them, and they're all delicious. My favorite is the fruit crisp special a la mode...they always have a crisp on the specials menu, usually with different kinds of fruit and ice cream each time. As for the prices, well...they're not astronomical by any means. Certainly reasonable for the quality and quantity of food. But because I always have to get the app, entree, dessert and wine, it can add up. If you ever find yourself meandering around North Beach with a hankering for seriously tasty food, I'd recommend this place over any of the Italian joints in the 'hood. UPDATE: Went back a couple weeks ago (I never turn down and invitation to go, naturally). I actually tried something different (gasp!). They had a special steak and papaya salad that was just succulent. It was light yet completely full of flavor and had just enough oil to give it that palatable taste and texture that natural fats provide. But most amazing was the papaya. IMO, it's REALLY tough to get a good papaya, and I rarely eat it because it so often has that weird "foot" taste. I trusted The House to overcome this obstacle and they did. I also had the tuna tartare appetizer once again. This time the tuna was fattier than I like (I prefer mine EXTRA lean), but it still tasted great. For dessert we had the coconut creme brule with passionfruit sauce. The BF insisted he was way too full for dessert, so that I should order whatever I want, and then he proceded to eat half of it because it was so yummy. The passionfruit rather overpowered the coconut, but I love passionfruit so this didn't bother me, and the texture was perfect. If you still haven't beeen here, DO IT already! :)

This is my new favorite place. ÊThe food was simply amazing. ÊWe started off with a watercrest and tempura salad and a piece of cooked unagi which was bathed in this incredible sause which I cannot begin to describe. ÊMain courses included delicious sea bass and a black cod miso that was simply amazing. ÊService lacked a little warmth, but the food came out really fast, especially the appetizers. ÊThat was pretty welcome because we were damn hungry. ÊIt felt a little out of place to have this tiny asian fushion place in the middle of north beach, which is great because it makes you feel like you've discovered a hidden gem (even though the line out the door tells you the opposite). ÊI love this place more than a fat kid loves cake (is this a lame joke now? ÊI think it is, but I'm still going with it anyway).

I will have to give this place 4 stars because I saw and tasted what they are capable of. Superb food. I ordered one thing, and got the opposite. I mean, it was what I ordered, but wasn't what I expected at all. It still tasted great though. You know a place is good if you order the wrong thing and it's still really good. Every single dish is amazing. Solid food, nice cozy atmosphere, extremely helpful waitstaff, and close proximity to MY house makes THE House one of my North Beach favorites!

Small and a bit cramped - but well worth the wait and the tight seating. The sea bass is amazing! Every appatizer I've tried tastes like more. Their steaks are marinated in a deliciously zingy flavor, well everything has a delicously zingy flavor actually. I don't think i could pick a favorite item if I had to. Their apple pie-esque dessert was great and only lasted about 2 minutes on the table before we'd completely finished it off. Can't wait to come back!

so i went here last night with my bf, it was a little hard to find because we got there @ night, and "the house" sign wasn't on. it took forever to get seated because it's a small restaurant and it was packed. it took almost 2 hours to get seated, for 2 people O m g! so i highly suggest you make reservations to this place. Ê for appetizers we got: oysters on the half shell (6 for $11), and a crabcake ($10). they both were yummmmmmmy. Ê for entrees: sea bass ($26), teriyaki salmon ($20?) . both were good, but definately get the sea bass. it does melt in your mouth! heh, however i think the noodles that accompanied the sea bass was kind of bland but it also comes with this soy / galic sauce to put on the noodles. Êthe teriyaki salmon was soupy but tastey as well. it was yummy, but the wait sucked .

I love this place. I always come here with my girl friend for special occasions. Especially we like the pomegranate porkchop with it's exquisite sauce. It is so rich with flavor, and matches perfectly with the pomegranate. We once got a waitress without a smile, but overall the service is alright. We went there during lunch time too, though I remember the selections weren't as good as during dinner time. ÊThe crab cake wasn't as good as the other ones on the menu, but overall it's worth 4 stars, or more. You just need to know what to order.

This is one of my favorite Asian Fusion restaurants. I love the seabass, rib eye, wasabi noodles, and the salmon rolls are pretty good too. It's a small, cute restaurant in North Beach.. parking is terrible.. but it's worth it. I'd say if you're in the neighborhood and you're choosing between Mona Lisa, Stinkin Rose, or this place.. This place wins hands down (granted they are all different types of restaurants) but this one the quality and taste is definitely top notch for my tastebuds.

Besides the place being small and packed the food was pretty good. ÊThe soft shell crab appetizer was BOMB but they need to put more tobiko on it.

i dont make my way to north beach often. well, when i feel like im being pretentious about something, i like to come to the bars and clubs to remind myself of what pretentiousness really is. but other then that, i dont usually make it to that part of the city. im a little in the dark as to what northbeach has to offer in terms of restaraunts, though, i have heard pretty negligable things. ate at the house a couple nights ago. had a special: the breaded sole in ponzu sauce.... now, as im writing this, ive realized that im probably not in the best position to review this place. i went here with a couple of friends who were meeting some more people there. i didnt know any of these people and they were all from out of town. you know those dinners where you cant really relax or enjoy because youre surrounded by strangers and feel an odd need to be overly courteous and entertaining, but its difficult because you were an insecure and introverted child? and even though the food is fan-F*ing-tastic, youre thinking... "god! when will this hell end?"... that was me circa saturday night at 7pm. ponzu sauce was pretty good though.

My opinion differs from everyone else's I guess. But I thought House was good at best. They attempt to do "Asian Fusion", but it seems to me they simply turn out Asian dishes and try to pass them off as some sort of fusion cuisine. I went with a large group of friends and was able to sample many appetizers. They were all okay, but many of the rolls reminded me of Japanese restaurant food and I didn't come to this restaurant to get Japanese food, I came for Fusion. Their mussels were very fresh and soft, but had very little flavor infused into them. The best items on their menu are probably the fish items. I had a VERY moist and delicate fish dish. The quality of the fish and the way it was cooked was definitely 5 stars, but the rest of the dish accompanying the fish were so so. There was a terrible sauce which seemed like it was just squirted out of a teriyaki sauce bottle and the sushi roll topping the fish was out of place. The size of the restaurant bothered me as well. IT'S TINY!!! The staff was accomodating as we reduced the # in our party, then added one at the last minute during our meal. They need more space and I guess that's not something legitimate to complain about, but the cramped quarters bothered me. Overall, it was an okay experience. I wish this place were more "Fusion" than merely "Attempts at Asian". The chefs seem to have good technique when preparing the dishes, just the flavors seemed to not match as well as it could have.

Must come here and try the Angus Steak. It's DELICIOUS!! feeling like seafood? Have the Ahi Tuna :) It's a bit pricey, but i'm sure everybody would pay a little more to have great food right? They have a few special (varies on Êwhat they currently offer) not listed on the menu, in which they would tell you when they give you the menu. Soft-shelled crab is very good for an appetizer. Everything here so far hits the spot! Enjoy guys!

The House serves up the most quintessential California cuisine with just a touch of Asian essence. I've been coming here for as long as I can remember and what keeps bringing me back is their consistency in quality, service, and taste. I just dined here with girlfriends to celebrate my getting wiser, and I was again very pleased. We started with their appetizer special of (3) seared day boat scallops topped with daikon sprouts in a light & savory lemon sauce. It was perfectly flavored and crisp on the outside. Scallops I've had at other restaurants are usually no bigger than a Susan B Anthony dollar, but theirs was very generous in size and extremely fresh. As for entrees, there is no way you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Several of us ordered their entree special of grilled Kobe rib eye over a bed of mash potatoes & Chinese broccoli in a chanterelle mushroom sauce, grilled ahi tuna with mustard aoili, and Neiman Ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce. My personal favorite was the Kobe steak cooked medium-rare. The meat was perfectly marbled & tender and the flavors were orgasmic! It is hands down the best Kobe steak I've ever had- 10x better than Harris Steakhouse's Waygu Kobe! When the Ahi came out, we were awwing at the beautiful presentation of seared Ahi leaning on a tower of thinly cut strips of fried taro. With one taste, you could tell that it was of excellent sushi grade tuna. When our last entree Pork with Pom over a bed of mash & asparagus came out, the plate itself look like an art piece from the SF MOMA. Not only did it look good, it had perfect sweet & savory flavors. The faint tartness of the pomegranate and currants finished the dish off very well. For dessert, I usually opt for their Apple Crumb Pie a la mode, but my BFF (Amy K.) surprised me with an amazing Coconut Cake with Buttercream frosting that she baked herself (House: She's taking orders if you interested ;). Our waitress was so kind to cut and serve the cake, and did not even charge a cake a cutting fee. I even had the entire restaurant singing Happy Birthday to me. It was just lots of good vibes throughout the whole dining experience. House has done it again by serving over-the-top food with stellar service that won't break the bank. This place is highly recommended, and I highly recommend you make reservations for large parties.

Back again and it's still good. For those complaining - Let's face it...This isn't your fine dining experience so drop the expectations and just enjoy it. This last time back had the calamari and probably wouldn't order it again. Sea bass was good and the rib eye was pretty good. Very good for the price. Too 'canto' style? Then suggest somewhere else with your review ;) ÊMsg me if you have a suggestion ...They should really invest in a bigger restaurant...

the food is great here but the restaurant is a little small. great place for a 4th or 5th date, not a first date scene. try the duck confit...one of the better dishes. My top favorites: Ahi Tuna Tartare with roasted Nori chips Seared Scallops Grilled Sea Bass Duck Confit The Ahi Tuna is always fresh and the nori chips provides a textural and palate enhancement. The seared scallops here are always light and seasoned perfectly. They're never too salty, undercooked or rubbery. The grilled sea bass is also very light but satisfying. The sauce fuses your taste buds with warm images of Asia in every bite. Duck Confit is typically not associated with Asian foods, but the presentation of bok choi and the preparation of the confit makes it a true fusion of not only taste but smell.

The House is surprisingly delicious. So good that I've returned at least 3 times within 5 weeks. Some good appetizers to start with would be the Maine Crab Cake with Pickled Ginger Remoulade, Ahi Tuna Tartare with Roasted Nori Chips, and the Fried Calamari wasn't bad either. For the entree, I highly recommend the Grilled Sea Bass with garlic ginger soy. ÊThe sea bass was cooked to perfection. ÊAnother recommendation would be the Niman Ranch Pork Chop with Pomegrante Currant Sauce. If you don't mind not having much privacy and cramped space, this place is definitely worth a try. ÊFor these reasons, this restaurant might not be an ideal place to take someone on a first date. ÊYou probably wouldn't want other customers to overhear your conversation. Be sure to make reservations ahead of time because this place is usually packed.

Call ahead and make reservations if you're planning to come for dinner as there is usually a 2 hour wait. I've dined here several times and each time I return, I always order the same dish - the sea bass. It's almost as if I forgot just how good it is. It's that first bite that reminds me why I love the house so much! Tender, perfectly seasoned, melt in your mouth goodness! I can't rave about their sea bass enough! The other dishes are very good as well. I'd recommend the tuna sashimi, green beans and rolls as well. The size of the resto is small but service is good and the worth makes it worth the wait!

ÊIn fact, at the end of the meal the man next to me commented that I should get a take out box because I hadn't finished my meal. ÊThe waitress was also very confused on the specials. ÊAfter we ordered two of the specials, the waitress came back and said that neither of the specials were available.

the food was good, i liked it a lot, and i would definitely go back. i had the chicken breast with roasted portabella white truffle oil sauce and my sister had the mushroom rice with grilled prawns. both were delicious. the only thing is that i would only ever go here if i made a reservation before hand, especially if i was going on a busy night. the restaurant is tiny and there's not much waiting room either. another downside? the tables are positioned close together, so i got to hear a play-by-play of the next table's awkward first date. the staff is friendly enough, but nothing to rave about.

I generally am not the biggest fan of Asian Fusion food but I must say that this place surprised me. It was quite tasty and I would come here again.

Came here a few weeks ago with a group of friends for a birthday celebration and was pretty impressed. The House isnt the biggest restaurant, so reservations are highly recommended. My bf had the steak which was cooked just perfect with the right amount of texture and sauce. (highly recommend ordering the steak rather than the short ribs w/ bbq sauce) Each plate was well presented. The staff here is also very nice and attentive.

BELIEVE THE HYPE--THE FOOD IS 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!!! Came here this past Saturday and we had reservations at 7:30, but wasn't seated until about 7:50 PM... FOOD: *Steamed Mussels: YUMMY--The mussels could have been a bit bigger (nickle sized), but nonetheless it was tender and the broth was rich and flavorful. It wasn't overly salted and had a nice kick and tang to it. I couldn't help but sip a spoonful of the broth with each mussel morsel. :D *American Kobe Skirt Steak with Porcini Mushrooms and Mash Potatoes--MmMmMmm! The steak was cooked perfectly (ordered Medium) and was tender. The porcini mushroom and reduction was a PERFECT compliment to the steak. The steak was pre-cut 'and wasn't drowned in the sauce so you can actually taste the meat. The mash potatoes was still chuncky but was creamy. A total steal at $30! *Seabass with garlic ginger soy with noodles: OMG! I'm not a huge fish fan (I like my fish raw), but it was AMAZINGLY GOOD! It's much better than the Misoyaki Butterfish at Roy's. The fish was succulent and grilled perfectly. Luckily, they put the ginger soy in a small bowl as it was a bit salty. Don't douse your fish with the sauce--a little goes a long way. Oh the noodles....it was cooked perfectly--al dente. I love how it had sliver of nori pieces which added a differnetny layer of texture. Aside from the garlic noodles at PPQ, the noodles at The House ROCKED! *Chocolate Truffle Cake with Espresso Ice Cream: YUMMY--another winner of the night! The cake litereally tasted like a chocolate truffle. It was decadent, smooth, rich, and not too sweet. The ice cream which was rich and smooth was a perfect compliment b/c it had a very slight bitterness. AMBIANCE: The House is very simple, super tiny (about 30-35 max capacity), and LOUD! So, as the other reviewers had mentioned, I wouldn't come here with a big group (no more than 4). Also, it's not the best place for a date unless you don't mind shouting from one end of the table to another and getting a lot of "huhs?" and "whats?". SERVICE: Was just ok. Our waitress seemed very flustered esp when talking about the specials. Understandable since there were 7 of them; they should have Êprinted it on paper and provided it along with the menu. My only complaint is I felt like we were being rushed. We weren't even done with out appetizer, and they wanted to pull it away. Nonetheless, our water glass was never empty and the food made up for everything. Ê PARKING: We were lucky to get street parking, but it's hard to find. There are nearby garages, but I think they close early. So, I would advise taking a cab or MUNI. The House is now my FAVORITE restarant. The food is awesome from start to finish and the prices are very reasonable (1 app, 2 entrees, 1 dessert, and 2 drinks for less than $100). This is a great place to hit up on a Friday/Saturday night before hitting the surrounding clubs/lounges. But, make sure to make reservations. I can't wait to go back and try the other things on their menu like the Porkchops. :)

I contemplated not writing a review for The House because I'm sure I really can't say anything that hasn't been said in +1200 other reviews, so I'll make my 2 cents quick. The House is a tiny, cozy, intimate restaurant that serves amazingly tasty, high quality food for a very reasonable amount. ÊWhen we dined there, we had: -Deep fried salmon rolls with Chinese hot mustard: delicious, perfectly cooked, artfully presented. ÊI think I may have asked for the mustard on the side. -Day boat scallops appetizer: I believe it was a special that day, and the scallops were sweet, firm and tender. -Pork chop with pomegranate sauce: Definitely order this, it was perfect. ÊThe sauce was delicious and a beautiful color and the pork chop was thick and juicy. -Fish (forgot what kind, it was also a special that day I think) with garlic noodles and sauteed beans: A fair portion of fish, crunchy beans and thick, chewy, tasty noodles. Ê -Dessert of kabocha pie and chocolate cake: The kabocha cake blew us away. ÊIt was like a pumpkin pie made with kabocha (type of squash). ÊIt wasn't riddled spices, you could taste the natural sweetness of the squash and it was a creamy, smooth texture. ÊI think I could've eaten a whole pie. ÊThe chocolate cake was really good too, I think it might have been flourless because it was very dense, thick and chocolatey. Ê Parking in North Beach is always a pain, so keep that in mind (we were late for our reservation because parking was nearly impossible). ÊGive The House a try, I guarantee you won't be disappointed!

Whenever my parents come to visit, we head to the House. Its that kind of family-- you find something you like and it stays around. You find something you dislike, its on the blacklist. And to have become our staple for off-the-plane grubbing, in the land of Quince and crab meat, is quite a thing. I love the fresh seafood that the House offers and the cold Duvel beer from the bottle. Likely to be a green bean appetizer and a tuna option, i've never been let down. The tea selection is also superb, and this is a nice follow to a lunchtime feast. I recommend reservations and fish first.

I will echo what others have said: a good-cookin', little, neighborhoody, asian-fusion, restaurant. ÊThat pretty much sums it up. ÊNone of the food is disappointing; some if it, I'll admit, is sub-fantastic; the sea bass, however, is the best I've ever, ever had. ÊThe whole family was steadily drawn towards the sea bass--my sea bass, thank-you-very-much--as the dinner progressed; and such a black-hole effect is strong evidence of superness.

After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to check this place out. ÊAnd you guys are right...the food here is ABSOLUTELY fabulous!! ÊWe started with the muscles. ÊI had the sea bass and my bf had the Angus steak w/ noodles. ÊWe ended with a peach sundae. ÊThey were all equally good. ÊI will DEFINITELY go back. ÊMinus one star for the small dining space....five stars for the food. ÊRegardless, the place was packed by 6pm. ÊLucky for us, we got there right when it opened so we didn't need reservations. ÊOur waiter was also very attentive. ÊMy goal will be to try everything on their menu. ÊI can't wait to go back!!!!!!

I had my parents take my friends and me here when they visited and we all loved it. My parents were blown away by the presentation (they're from Ohio). My mom had this dish that was topped by paper thin flakes of something, that when mixed with the heat from the dish, they moved around like it was alive - kind of trippy but fun. None of the dishes were bland, that's for sure. Some even had a bit more kick to it than I prefer. Service was great, food was great, a solid 4-star performance.

Came here per recommendation from my sister, and my taste buds were titillated by the abundance of flavor they encountered at The House. We shared the steak, mushroom rice, a special off-the-menu pork dish, and a sea bass i think. The Steak and the Mushroom rice were my obvious favorites. The steak was tender and bursting with garlic peppery flavor. I LOVE mushrooms so the mushroom rice was a big hit. Good rustic mushroomy earthy flavors with just a hint of truffle i think. ANYTHING with truffle is an easy win so I gobbled that up pretty fast. The special pork was a really moist, flavorful pork shoulder? It was in a milky broth that was quite delicious. I believe they slow cook this for days so we had to order it in advance. I got a little piece of pork fat and it was rich and delicious! A true guilty pleasure. All the sides that came on the plates with the dishes were just as good as the entree. Wish i could come here again. I feel like I need mushroom rice at least once a week.

My friend raved about this place so I decided to give it a try. I went there around 12:30 and the place was half empty. I ordered Crab Cakes which is not offered during lunch time but they fulfilled my request anyway which is very impressive. I also ordered the Sea Bass because my friend said it was one of the best dish out of the most entrees. Now I understand why she likes it so much!! The fish was so soft, juicy and tender. The sauce was perfect to go with the fish. A little sweet and sour soy with ginger. MmmmmmMMmmm I will eat that any day! ÊMy boyfriend ordered the spicy wasbie noodles with pork and it was very good too. But if you can't take a lot of heat do not order that!! ohhh and we had dessert which was the chocolate cake! OMG THAT cake was soOoOoOOO Good! It really HIT THE SPOT. ÊThe waitress was attentive and very nice. I don't feel rushed or anything so very good. ***** One star get subtracted because their HOT TEA price is crazy!! A small size of my fist tea pot Jasmine Tea that is chipped doesn't seem clean with decent tea at price of 6 dollars per person is way too much. For 6 dollars I expect them to give me two tea cups so I can share with my boyfriend or put it in a nicer bigger pot!! Tea is not that expensive!! Either way, do not order tea there. Everything else was fair price and very good! Me and my boyfriend had a great time!!!

Make reservations and prepare to wait a little bit too. This place is small, cute, and delicious. We had the crab cake appetizer, which is like no other crab cake I have ever had. First it was the size of a bartlett pear. In fact, it was in the shape of a bartlett pear. We had this fish dish that came with these thick noodles sprinkled with sesame seeds. Those noodles were almost the highlight of the dish.

The food to die for! Sea bass, garlic noodles, shrimp and chive dumplings, mango pudding, tempura string beans-- nothing was not unique and flavorful and beautifully presented. Our waiter was super sweet and helpful, a rarity in the City. One of the best restaurants food-wise in the City! There are always tons of daily specials on the menu so you can have something different each visit! And I noticed a few reviewers on Yelp were concerned about the portion sizing. I am a HUGE eater and the entree was plenty huge for me. The food is pretty rich, so if you order the sea bass, no need to fret over the portion size!

YuuuMMMMY! ÊI give the food 5 stars BUT parking was a bitch and the place was really small and squishy. But I'd definitely go back for the food. We started off with the ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips which was delicious and nicely presented. For my entree, one of my friends who we were having dinner with recommended the grilled sea bass...OMG, I don't think I've had fish that good! In fact, even the sides were tasty. It came with some noodles and veggies. Now, I'm not really a veggie person but I ate every lil piece that was on my plate. Overall, I LOVED this place but hate the thought of having to drive into the area and search for parking....oh well, the things I will do for good food...=)

i enjoy "small bite" restaurants. Êi have an affinity for asian food. Êput those loves together, and you get a satisfied dining experience at the house. about 10-12 tables in very close proximity to each other (i enjoyed our neighbors' conversations regarding pregnancy and travel), along with paintings and photos by local artists decorated the narrow interior of the restaurant. Êaka make reservations...ideal for groups of 6 or less. i opted for the ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips, the special seared scallops with a flavored butter sauce, and a glass of sake. Êmy lad ordered the hamachi herb green salad, shrimp tempura salad, and the special bone-out short rib with shoestring fries. ahi: the tartare looked a bit too mashed up, as if the tuna had been cubed with a less-than-stellarly-sharp knife, ending up in a less-than-stellar presentation. Êhowever, the flavor was there, soy/ginger/a splash of mirin, played to the tuna well. Êthe long, triangular nori chips provided the right texture balance with the fresh fish. scallops: were cooked perfectly well. seared and carmelized on the outside, warm on the inside. Êpresentation was decadent! my boyfriend doesn't like to share, but of the few bites i did have of his dishes- the hamachi sashimi salad was as expected (not too spectacular, could have done with a bit more dressing), the shrimp tempura was perfectly tender with a crisp coating and it paired well with the cool greens. Ê all in all... knowledgeable wait staff, clean decor, spot-on presentation, a happy merrying of asian flavors all under one roof. Êthe house afforded me an impeccable meal ending my weekend in sf.

We made reservations at 7pm and showed up just in time before the dinner crowd started pouring in. The service was amazing. From start to finish the server was attentive and personable, which made our meal that much more fun. Being Asian, I usually shy away from anything "Asian Fusion" because my concept is, why eat fusion when you can eat the real stuff? But this place has made me a believer of fusion. All dishes were impeccably prepared with every last detail thought out. For appetizers, we got a grilled calamari with tomato aeoli and then a deep fried salmon that was wrapped in a seaweed sheet, deep fried, and layed on a bed of sour cabbage with a sweet wasabi sauce that was AMAZINg and totally to die for. For entree: Grilled Sea Bass was amazingly cottony soft and juicy, grilled crunchy on the outside and just soft and melts-in-your-mouth tender on the inside. It sits on a side of ginger soy mixed udon noodles and some green beans. Ahi Tuna (raw) was grilled on the outside but raw on the inside. It sits on a bed of rice and trio of sauces that tasted wasabi-ish but sweet and just yummy. The Tuna was so fresh and beautifully red. They had some specials but if you don't get there quick enough they can be gone real quick if they're popular (I was drooling over the short ribs next table over) which is good I guess, because that means they keep their ingredients really fresh! Overall a wonderful experience that I would highly highly recommend to anyone visiting San Fran!

Always spot on. I've been here a bunch of times (even more since moving in nearby), and they never disappoint. I've been there for large group parties, as well as the frequent drop-by without a reservation, and the food is always fabulous, the service great, and the wine list interesting. I have only once had a mediocre piece of tuna there, and even though I didn't say anything to them about it (hey, everyone deserves an off night), they noticed I hadn't really finished my fish and were super apologetic, following our dinner up with some incredible, smooth mango tapioca. The sea bass is just phenomenal - every time.

My boyfriend and I had early dinner reservations here on Valentines Day. Man, the traffic getting here blows, and we were 15 minutes late. ÊHowever, the lady graciously greeted us at the door and we were seated promptly. ÊThey had a special Valentines Day menu, which the waitress explained was a gathered list of The House specials. ÊEverything looked scrumptious! ÊWe started off with the Fried salmon roll with a hot Chinese mustard dipping. We both didn't anticipate it being as hot as it was and we dipped it in happily; the stinging feeling up our noses certainly did not feel so good. It was so delicious though, just don't go overboard with the sauce. ÊNext our dinner came, I ordered the Blackened cod with the avocado roll, and my boyfriend being the carnivore he is, opted for the Kobe steak. ÊThe cod literally melted in my mouth, and who knew avocado rolls could be so awesome? ÊThe steak my boyfriend ordered was cooked to perfection. He loved and savored every bite. ÊAnd of course, can't forget dessert, my favorite part of any meal. ÊThe bittersweet fudge was like a bite of heaven, it was sooooo rich and decadent, I resisted ordering another one.

It is a bit sad that the best restaurant in North Beach aka Little Italy, is a Asian fusion restaurant - but don't let that detract from the delicious food that this restaurant turns out.

This place was recommended to me by my friends who went via Yelp and I do have to say even though they had specials my wife and I decided to go with the rib eye and the sea bass. You can't go wrong with either of the two, also if your lucky they might have some yummy appetizers.

A cozy restaurant that produces delicious fusion cuisine. The fish is incredibly fresh! The lightly fried soft shell crab and seared jumbo sea scallops were marvelous. The batter on the crab was relatively light with just enough seasoning as to not overpower the natural flavor of the crab. The scallops were perfectly cooked and they were paired with a wonderfully subtle lemon/cream sauce. For my main course, I ordered the "tuna special." You need to ignore my poor choice of words to describe the name of the dish because I simply cannot remember what they called it; however, it was amazing, and if they continue to offer it, I highly recommend you order it for dinner. I consider "The House" a culinary oasis among the dreadful tourist traps in North Beach. By the way, what the heck happened to North Beach? It has become a real cesspool! Shame on you Mayor Newsom.

Food: Great fusion style foods. ÊOrdered the Sea Bass (amazingly cooked), the side sauce was a bit salty for my likings though. ÊMy friend got the mahi mahi which was cooked perfectly as well. ÊWe ordered an appetizer, deep fried salmon roll, which was packed with salmon. ÊPortions were a good leaned towards the larger size for a lunch. Ê Service: Good service, water was kept topped off. Ê Atmosphere: Small restaurant, tables are pretty close in the front, if you want more privacy request a table towards the back. Ê Price: total price came out to roughly $65 with tax and tip for a party of two; two entrees and one appetizer.

WOW! House is fantastic. No wonder it's a favorite restaurant among my friends. We came here for a 14 person birthday dinner and they were so accomodating. (Of course the reservation was made weeks (4+) in advance.) House is a cute tiny restaurant with amazing food. - Started with the deep fried salmon roll ($9ish). Ooh tasty! Imagine a salmon sushi roll minus rice, then lightly fried with a spicy ginger soyu sauce. Yum! Served with a cabbage slaw. Shareable. Others around the table had Scallop salad, Grilled Asparagus in a curry-esque sauce, all delish. - Main: I couldn't resist the call of the Seabass. Superb. Grilled top and bottom perfectly while keeping the thick center cut tender and buttery. Seriously, it was melt in your mouth good. Served with stir fried udon noodles and thin string beans. I ate my entire plate! Other tempting options were the Miso Black Cod with a Calif Roll. That was good too (but not as good as the Seabass). The Pork Kurobuta smelled and looked amazing. It was the pomengranate sauce that made the difference. - Dessert: Chocolate truffle cake was a bit on the thick side. So if you're craving heavy chocolate this is for you. Comes w a scoop of yummy ice cream too. Also had the Warm Apple Crisp with Vanilla Ice Cream. Actually served warm. Super good. Finally tried the Coconut Creme Brulee with Carmelized Passionfruit. Very tasty. The coconut was subtle and it was the passionfruit you tasted in the "crust". All deliciously decadent. I will definitely be coming back to House. Excellent service. Excellent Food. Quaint ambiance. Hint: Impressive date place.

The House defines San Francisco - quaint, contemporary, and humble. I loved my dining experience there. Their staff is very well coached and understands the menu inside out.

Just be sure to call ahead and make a reservation - the vicinity is small and they fill up very quickly.

I saw this place featured on KQED's Check Please! and was really excited to try it for lunch (cheaper that way). I guess I was kinda disappointed by the dumplings and the salmon roll. The textures were good, but I wanted more flavor. We ordered the black cod with the deep fried ginger soy sauce as our entree and by then i was convinced this place was not overrated. the fish was perfectly cooked and the flavors were spectacular to say the least. lychee iced tea is not bad either. i would definitely go back for dinner.

I miss their location in the Sunset, where I once went for a birthday party. SF, you need to deserve this place! Best fusion food ever (and I hate fusion food, especially when it was all the rage). The one entree you must have here is the sea bass, I don't care that it's overfished and that it's un-PC to order it. It's divine. It's a tightly packed room, sparsely decorated with colorful deco light fixtures and small works of art. The blond-wood tables can get quite crowded and noisy. But you're here for the sea bass.

Êits a pretty small place so we were lucky to be seated so quickly... a crowd and a line of people soon followed so we felt bad lounging after our meal. this place doesn't disappoint. it's been a while since i've eaten here, but i think i'm due for another visit soon!

didn't make reservations that saturday night. they said it would be a 45 minute wait, but turned out to be only 15 minutes. they gave us these pickled cucumbers with roasted sesame seeds as a free side dish, and it was refreshing to eat. when main course came, i was so excited by the presentation. the grilled ahi tuna was tender and thick. a cloud of fried thin carrot and red cabbage strips garnished the top. the fish was over a bed of blanched spinach and jasmine rice. surrounded by this orange aoli/green wasabi sauce with caviar in little bundles. mmm it was as good as it looked! Ê my date had the seabass with ginger soysauce. the fish was cooked perfectly. the noodles and green beans were a little salty though. for dessert, we ordered the coconut panna cotta with passion fruit puree. the puree was a but too tangy but still really good overall. service was good. atmosphere was cozy. i would definitely recommend this place if you want a nice and delicious dinner.

Excellent service - great food - nice wine list - I had a really nice dinner here. We had the family salmon roll, which was crunchy on the outside and still rare on the inside. Then we both had one of the specials of the night - tuna two ways, and the hamachi. Now, the only downpoint of the night was the hamachi which was overcooked and not as light as it should have been. But the tuna was perfect. Had the passionfruit creme brulee for dessert which was wonderful!

I'm not sure being the 361st reviewer means anything statistically speaking but the food here was really good. I had the sea bass since everyone recommended it.

After hearing about how great the sea bass was, I decided to try it out. ÊIt was tasty but I was eyeing my bf's Black Cod w/ CA roll and chinese greens. ÊNot only was his entree more visually appealing, it was much more delicious. ÊThe cod just melted in my mouth and the CA roll was interestingly presented. ÊFor dessert we tried the mango tapioca and the coconut creme brulee w/ passion fruit puree. ÊThe mango tapioca didn't taste much like mango... more of an almond flavor. Êit was still very delicious w/ the sago on the bottom (my favorite). ÊThe creme brulee had a really good texture... didn't really taste a lot of coconut. Êthe passion fruit puree provided a tartness that definitely cut the richness of this dessert.

I had dinner here on Sunday for our anniversary. It was a special occasion, so we had a reservation (which I recommend as this place does get packed since it's so small). The buser sat us at a 3 top, then they shoved us to the back area since we were only 2. Fair enough. We are greeted by a waitress, who struggled to name the specials. It was pretty painful to sit through and then we ordered the fried calamari & caesar salad with scallops to start. The fried calamari & salad were both amazing. The salad was a little overdressed, but I didn't mind since the dressing was almost like a miso-caesar salad so it was yummy. The scallops did resemble tater tots but they were crispy pieces of goodness. We ordered the grilled sea bass & rib eye for entrees. The grilled sea bass was buttery perfection. The garlic ginger soy was also very tasty. I enjoyed the udon noddles on the side too. The only two down points of the meal were the Angus ribeye steak & our waitress. The steak was so bad, that my boyfriend had to send it back. For one, you could barely cut it, I know ribeyes are marbled with fat, but this was ridiculous. We weren't asking for the most tender piece of meat (obviously) but to the point where you can't eat or cut it was unacceptable. When the waitress asked how the food was we said we couldn't eat the steak and so she took it begrudgingly took it back and we asked for the Êrib special instead. We were happy that she took it back, but at this point she proceeded to ignore us the rest of the meal. Her nazi- militant attitude was a little abrasive, and if I were to go back I would definitely not want to be seated in her section. On a positive note, the ribs were delicious and I would certainly order them again. They were paired with a cole slaw that was very tasty. All in all I had a pleasant experience at the House and I would certainly come back. I don't know that I'd crave the food on the daily, but if I had friends out of town visiting I would bring them here. I would also request to be seated with the non-militant waitress.

seriously, just come here. great food, great prices, great service - they have beautiful dishes in a relaxed, unfussy atmosphere. If you come with four people, share two appetizers, two main courses, and two desserts. perfect amount of food. I must rave about the dessert though: a berry trifle that was HEAVENLY - gorgeous berries, cream that was sweetened just the right amount. It was strange to eat such a western dessert after asian fusion but much welcomed and lovely.

Asian-fusion Nirvana! The House has been one of our favs for years, since a friend recommended the sea bass. Favorite dishes: Anything tuna, but particularly the panko crusted ahi tuna rolls (everyone, ask for it to be made a regular item!), the grilled ahi tuna main, anything unagi (where does he get those huge eels?), the salmon roll appetizer (mustard sauce to clear the sinuses). The seabass is the signature dish, if there is one, and deservedly so--melt-in-your-mouth tender, with oh-so-good garlic-ginger-soy sauce and noodle accompaniment. Saturday they had a pork belly appetizer on, a veritable mountain of pork, perfectly rendered to the peak of moistness, then finished with a heavenly crust. But the sleeper is Saturday lunch, with most of the dinner menu available and not as packed as the evenings. On a cold day, get the short ribs and the salmon roll, and you'll be ready to face the city.

The House is fantastic! ÊIt "hits the ball out of the park" as far as casual dining goes. ÊGreat vibe, tasty food and reasonable prices. ÊI'm still thinking about their pork chop which was, hands down, the best I have ever had. ÊFor the wine lovers out there, the wine list is decent but limited. ÊCorkage is reasonable at $20 a bottle. Ê Ok, here's the drawback: ÊIt's a tiny restaurant and it's crowded. ÊWe had a reservation but had to wait ten minutes to be seated. ÊThat didn't bother me as much as where we had to wait; in the small entry way with four other people, hovering over other diners. ÊThat's the only thing holding me back from a five star rating.

First off, I don't give many restaurants a five star rating, but for The House I must. ÊThe food is fantastic!!! ÊI really am not into the fusion thing...I think most people do it terribly BUT when you do it well, it can be five star worthy! ÊThe House does a great job obviously. ÊI'm not so into the location (though it's convenient for me with work right around the corner), the staff isn't that friendly, and it's a small joint...but all that doesn't matter to me because I love their food. ÊI am really into fish, most of the time raw, only because I feel like everyone overcooks it. ÊTemperature is key for me, especially when it comes to fish. ÊI think they do a great job with the temperature of the fish. ÊThe sauces are always so good too...it definitely has an Asian flair. ÊTheir sea bass is killer. ÊI will continue to give them business!!

Went here for anni # 5. Wow, this place is great! We ordered the kobe beef papaya salad first (yum!), followed by the seabass with green beans and garlic noodles (for me) and seared yellow tail with mussels in a curry sauce for Carla. For drinks we had a Japanese stout beer. To top it all off we had the persimmon bread pudding for dessert. I hate green beans, mostly cuz it reminds me of my 5th grade cafeteria... but eating the green beans on my plate made me realize how green beans are actually quite delicious! I enjoyed the seabass and the teriyake type dipping sauce that was included. Carla's dish was also tasty! We enjoyed every aspect of our meal, from the food to the service, to the lovely decor of the place. 2 thumbs up! Can't wait to go back!

Still my favorite after 8 years. We went last night for dinner. After starting with their famous Salmon rolls and a scallop special, I was in heaven. For dinner, I had the Korean style ribs, my fellow diners had the Kobe beef special and the hamachi special. All were delicious. And then for dessert, we ate the chocolate flour-less cake. If you have not tried The House before, go for lunch sometime. The noodle dishes and sandwiches are superb. Their consistency rocks and their seafood is some of the best in the Bay Area. Eat it.

House is still pretty exceptional. It's been around a long time now and isn't new and doesn't have that "it's special" effect anymore - but I've never had a bad meal and almost always have had a great meal. it's loud in there, a lot of reflective surfaces -- and service varies, but the food is always interesting and yummy. Where else you gonna get grilled salmon over tapioca polenta?? Most people come to NB for Italian (mistakenly believing that we have great Italian in NB) but The House remains one of the top spots in North Beach and well worth the time and money. It's a sort of Asian-fusion meets Calif, no bread served, Asian teas, good wine selection -- things like shitake mushroom dumplings (very good!), grilled rib eye over Wasabi -- sweet pickles -- it's solid even after all these years.

Probly more of a 3.5 star place... The food is definitely 5 STARS. Ive been here a bunch of times, but now im fine sticking with the sea bass. in fact, it's pretty much the only reason i go here now...because im craving the sea bass. it comes with some garlic noodles but not as much as before. sometimes its a bit salty. ive had a taste of almost everything else and its all pretty good. MINUS 1 STAR for the atmosphere. The place is pretty small so the tables are a bit too close together. definitely not an intimate place and it gets pretty loud and muggy inside. There is also almost always a table of asians who are louder than everyone else. MINUS HALF for the hostess. I think she's the owner or at least related to the owner somehow. youll recognize her as the small lady with oily wiry hair that walks toward you from the kitchen when you walk in. she doesnt look like she works there but she'll come up to you and just look at you without saying anything. so be ready to tell her you have a reservation (you should definitely make one bc ive seen them turn people away almost everytime). anyhoo...shes not very friendly. not mean or rude, just not friendly. MINUS another half because it always takes long to get our check. I have seen them turn people away because they missed their reservation by 20-30 minutes. I consider this a PLUS ONE HALF star because other people have made the effort to be on time. thats all

My wife and I were celebrating our 5 year anniversary in San Fran and could not resist the excellent reviews we have seen on yelp. The reviewers got it right. The food was excellent. Based on other recommendations, we ordered the seared scallop appetizer, which melted in your mouth. We followed that up with the Sea bass and one of the specials, Cod. ÊWOW! Ê2 outstanding fish dishes that tasted completely different. The portions were just right, no need for dessert. The only downside was the wine selection, my ÊPinot Noir that I ordered by the glass, was way too warm. ÊUnfortunately, I have to deduct a star for the wines by the glass. However, there was a decent by the bottle wine list. For you out of towers that drive to The House, when you drive down Grant, a one way street, make a right turn as soon as you get to the restaurant, which is on the corner, Êgo up the alley and you will find a parking lot. ÊPaying $6 an hour sure beats trying to find a parking spot in this heavily congested neighborhood.

This place is amazing! We visited SF back in February (somehow I forgot to write a review), and a friend recommended we go to House. ÊWe owe her big time because the food was absolutely scrumptious. To start, we had the deep-fried salmon roll with Chinese mustard. ÊI think I had a food-gasm for sure. ÊCrispy fried goodness on the outside, yet the salmon on the inside was almost completely rare (just the way I like it!). ÊMustard sauce was sufficiently spicy and added a kick to the dish. ÊFor entrees, I ordered the sea bass and my hubby ordered the flat iron steak with wasabi noodles. ÊBoth were ridiculous. ÊCooked to perfection, great flavors, and very reasonably priced to boot. Ê We will definitely return on our next trip to San Fran!

I went to this place with my friends a while back and I had the most wonderful experience. HOWEVER, it was my mom's bd this weekend and I wanted to take her somewhere nice. So I chose to goto this place at the last minute and went without reservations. We got there around 7pm. A woman approached us asking if we had a reservation and we replied no. Then, she gave both my parents a glare and, with attitude, she told us it would be a 45 minute wait. Turned around and left us at the door and didn't come back. Eventually, I had to go up to her (by the kitchen) and tell her we wanted to wait. She asked for our contact number and told us to walk around the area. ÊShe said she will call us when a table was ready in 45 minutes. WE WAITED UNTIL 8:30PM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HOUR AND A HALF LATER!! My mom was starving and it was the worse experience ever. We didn't even make to the table. Still to this day I haven't recieved a call from her. ÊI felt REALLY bad because I wanted to show my mom how great a restaurant it was since she hardly gets to goto nice places.

The House NEVER fails to amaze me. This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city :) I just recently came here (for the millionth time) for my birthday. My friend and I shared: Appetizer: * ahi tuna tartar: there's a fair amount of wasabi here, so if you can't / don't like the taste.. probably will not like this. it comes with three tortilla pieces stacked with ahi tuna tartar in between... delicious! * fried calamri: good, but nothing special in my opnion. Some of the other appetizers I've tried in the past include: * scallops (this is part of their "special" menu): SO succulent! it comes with three (small) pieces... but ever so delicious! Main course: * mushroom & prawn risotto: this is HEAVEN in your mouth! * miso glazed cod (this is also part of their "special" menu) Dessert: * truffle chocolate cake with the coffee icream: the coffee ice cream is GREAT, but the truffle chocolate cake is SUPER heavy, so beware... I think I almost had to drink a full glass of water afterwards! I opted out on the wine this time around...

Fantastic place to eat. The food was delicious, hitting all the right tastes without overdoing the flavors. For the appetizer, we had the salmon egg roll. The hot mustard sauce was perfect. The bed of salad was crisp and seasoned with sesame. We then had the pork chops with pomegranate sauce and black rock cod. The pork chop was absolutely fabulous. It was the best pork chop I have had. The pomegranate sauce was great with the pork chop as well as with the mashed potatoes (who would have known mash potatoes and pomegranate was a good combo). There was a slight hint of basil that worked well to keep the flavors of the sauce from being just a sweet sauce. ÊMy wife had the black rock fish. Since they had a California roll on top, the sauce they used was like the sauce on unagi. It worked well with both the California roll and the black rock fish. Service was good. It was a slow day due to the rain, so they took care of us. It is a great place. Driving to the area is a little awkward due to the fact that it is a small restaurant on an intersection that wont let you turn onto the street (we were driving from Van Ness Ave going down Broadway). Good thing I read that there was a parking garage on Vallejo and Stockton that was two blocks away. ÊThe seafood items like the Sea Bass and Black Rock fish was $24-25. And the Pork chop was $18. Next time I go, I will try the Sea Bass. I didn't give this restaurant a 5 stars because this is my first review so I am saving it for some spectacular place. Definitely Ê4.5 stars if I could choose it.

After dining at the house restaurant for the first time, I had a chance to experience the positive food reviews. ÊBased on my initial experience, I decided to pay them a second visit. Ê The second visit was a complete BUST!!! We were treated like neglected 17 year old orphans that nobody wanted. ÊWhen asked how long is the wait, we were told 40-45 mins. We stood outside waiting for more than an hour and a half!!! This is completely unacceptable for any restaurant standards. ÊWe checked in every 30 mins to see if we were next.

Considering the reviews on Yelp, I was very excited to go to the House and meet friends from out of town. Not entirely a let down, but, not up to par with the RAVE reviews I've read here. Average 4.5 stars out of 1000+ reviews, you'd think that this would be a foodie's dream but, it was more of a mediocre experience. Here's the breakdown: - Location is great in North Beach, parking is down the street and costed $9 for a couple of hours. Not too bad. Ê - Inital impression when walking in - super packed and cramped. Ê - Service was above average. Waitress acknowledged us quickly and was friendly. - Food wise: Much too salty. Noodles reminded me of any stir fry Mongolian bbq place where they cook Êyour food on a huge stove right in front of you with two big chopsticks. Fish was cooked perfectly. - Some dishes were overpriced. - Presentation was above average. All in all, a decent experience but, does not live up to the HYPE!

This is actually my second time to The House. Both times left me wanting more. More flavor, more imagination, more service, more something..... Review of the food: Salad with fried chicken liver (probably one of the more adventurous items on the starter section). The liver was cooked well; the salad was just okay, no imagination with the dressing. Tuna Club Sandwich. If executed properly it could/should have been great. But the Tuna was basically scrap meat, the bread was cooked in butter, and it was overall to salty. Also, it looked like it was literally thrown together. Tuna was only on the center part of the sandwich, after 2 bites, no more tuna. I would not go back.

Idiots or thief's, you decide Ê Ê I called this restaurant to make a reservation after seeing a review on channel #9. ÊTwo hours after making the reservation I get a call on my cell from a blocked number. Some one on the phone, not the person that took my reservation, in very bad English tells me that I need to give them my credit card number to hold my reservation???? I explained to them very clearly that I did not know who they were, and that there was no way I was giving them my credit card number. I asked them to have the owner call me. 20 Minutes later I receive a call from a blocked number again a completely different person, not the person that took my reservation or the person that had called the second time. This person tells me she is the manager and that the owner would not be calling me. I told her that there was no way I was going to give my credit card to some stranger on the phone from a blocked number. What kind of an idiot would call me from a blocked number, having never spoken to me before and expect that I would give them a Credit Card Number over the phone? I don't care how good the food is; obviously the management of the restaurant is incredibly weak. That being the case, how good can the food be anyway? Just FYI, even if the restaurant had asked me for the card when I initially called, I would have told then to take a hike. And I am, and I have!!

I came here possibly ten years ago and I can always remember about my visit here. And I finally came to decide to write a review. The food here are definitely interesting. Their style of cooking is, in fact, tasty. Pricing is a little overdone and the lighting is too dim.

The House is the reason why I love Asian fusion. My favorite appetizer is one of their specials, the day boat scallops. AMAZING!!-- the scallops are seared to perfection and seasoned wonderfully. Their grilled sea bass is also exceptional. Holy smokes! Best fish dish I have ever had. Sea bass is flaky and tender with great, GREAT flavors. I really like that the garlic ginger soy dressing for the bass is served on the side, too. The scallops and sea bass are top-notch, but I have yet to try a dish that I didn't like here. Their desserts are also great. Great food with good portions and reasonable prices. Ordering an appetizer, entree, and dessert, with tax, usually comes out to around $50 per person. It's a definite winner.

I came here when vacationing out to SF for the first time. ÊI had asked one of my co-workers originally from SF about a good place to have dinner. ÊWithout any hesitation he exclaimed "The House." ÊHe warned me though that I should make a reservation at least a week in advance because the restaurant is quite small and very popular. ÊI had called and made my reservation at 7:30. When we arrived the hostess greeted us and told us that we had to wait even with a reservation. ÊUnfortunately the restaurant was so small that there wasn't enough space to wait. ÊMy date and I ended up waiting outside for up to 30 minutes. ÊThings did not begin well and I was starting to regret listening to my co-worker and never heed his advice ever again. ÊFinally we were seated. ÊOur table was in the back, small two top. ÊThe ambience reminded me of being back in New York City, where all the tables are crowded together. ÊOur waitress came by and presented the dinner specials. ÊThe soft crab tempura appetizer jumped out immediately at us and we ordered that off the specials. ÊMy date ordered the "flat iron steak with wasabi noodles" and i, "Berkshire pork chop in black currant sauce." ÊOur crab appetizer arrived and it looked amazing. ÊActually at first it looked quite daunting as my date and I thought for a moment on how to approach eating this dish. ÊIt came with a small dipping sauce consisting of cilantro, vinegar, chile pepper and fish sauce. ÊReminded me a lot of the dipping sauce you get at a Vietnamese restaurant, except with a kick. ÊMy date and I tore into the appetizer dipping the perfectly crispy crab into sweet, spicy and tangy sauce. ÊA very simple and straight forward dish executed perfectly. Our main courses arrived and to my surprise the portions were quite large especially for the price. ÊBoth our dishes were under $20 each. ÊPiled high on top of a bed of udon noodles was perfectly charred medium rare flat iron steak. ÊHer dish came with a crisp slaw of carrots, cucumber and pickled ginger, dressed in a Korean spiced pepper dressing. ÊMy thick cut pork chop garnished with chives and sesame seeds came served on a bed of smooth, creamy mashed potatoes and asparagus and lightly covered in a sauce of black currants. ÊBoth dishes were visually stunning. Ê5 stars for plating. ÊA night that started off on the downside was quickly making a turn. ÊAnd what do you know? The food even tasted as good as it looked. ÊSteak with udon, just enough wasabi to give it that nice kick combined with acid and spice from the slaw made it a great complement to the steak. ÊThe pork chop was cooked perfectly, moist and tender with just enough black currant sauce. ÊSauce was also not too sweet, which is a plus. Ê We were stuffed that we could not even order dessert. ÊThe portions were so enormous, we had left overs for the next day. ÊWill I return? Yes! ÊIt's a must whenever I go to SF. Ê5 stars for the food, affordability and originality.

ÊBut i GUESS they can. update: i came back again for the food with a party of 6. Êwe get it, the food is so good that you don't have to smile at your customers. Êyou could have had an extra star if you smiled. ÊThis is your second time you haven't smiled, so i guess we gave you a fair chance.

I came here for dinner after a co-worker enthusiastically recommended it multiple times. The food is absolutely killer and beautifully presented. All of the dishes really showed an attention to detail and looked like something you'd find at a restaurant in Hawaii - lots of fresh fish and bright colors. I was really impressed by the selection of unusual fish on the menu and had a really hard deciding what to order. The only thing I wasn't too keen on was the atmosphere - it's extremely loud and crowded and there are only a few inches between tables. There also isn't much in the way in of decor. I'd definitely recommend The House for an evening out with a small group of friends, rather than a romantic date.

I've been here for lunch and dinner, and while the dinner menu has more to offer, I loved them both. Their curry noodles (add salmmon) is really good, as well as the salmon rolls. For dinner I had a butterfish special, which was so good I could've dropped dead happy. MUST save room for dessert, they have a KILLER tapioca pudding. I could eat it for days and be the happiest person in the world!

You know, if you keep on talking once the food comes out, I'm going to finish whatever we're splitting before you finish yapping away. Sorry, boss. But anyway, I love this small nook of a restaurant even though some people seem to have an aversion to "fusion" food. Boss asked me to pick a place for us and a colleague that wouldn't break the bank to have lunch at, so I picked The House which was right down the street from our office. Didn't have a reservation, but we went early enough (around 11:45) and there were only a few tables occupied at the time. Split the calamari appetizer while boss kept talking business (although the soft-shell crab looked great as well). Think he might have gotten two bites while the rest of us scarfed them down. Oops. He got the Udon Noodle Soup with Grilled Chicken and Toasted Nori., while we got Warm Wasabi House Noodles, one with Grilled Pork, the other with Grilled Salmon. Everything came out great, perfectly spiced, cooked, and devoured. My salmon was a bit on the rare side which was awesome. I was enjoying my noodles so much I might not have heard a thing my boss said during lunch. (I hope he doesn't read this). But whatever, good service, good food, definitely will be back.

So the thoughtful bf made reservations to celebrate my birthday at Ruth Chris about a month ago to surprise me...a few days before that dinner I told him that I didn't feel like eating anything too "meaty". ÊThe poor thing not only had to cancel the reservations, but had to find another restaurant that he knew that I would like. ÊFortunately for him (and me) he was referred to The House by a friend of his. ÊWe had a soft shell crab tempura and scallops (that was a special item for that evening) for appetizers. ÊThe scallops were really good! ÊVery fresh and the sauce complemented it well....the soft shell crab was good, but it was on top of a cabbage (?) salad that was too peppery for my tastes. ÊFor the entree dishes we got the filet mignon on a bed of spinach and mashed potatoes and the ahi tuna (both were specials). Ê The fish was also very fresh and came with some veggies. ÊThe filet mignon was tender and yummy. ÊWe shared the chocolate truffle cake with coffee ice cream for dessert. ÊYum-o. ÊThe reason why I gave this place 4 stars is because of the seating. ÊI'm not that big, but I had a hard time maneuvering out of my seat fearing that my Ê@$$ would knock the plates off our neighbors' table. ÊIf they could spread out the seating arrangement, I would definitely add at least 1/2 a star:) And yes, after all the trouble of changing reservations, I ended up getting the filet mignon. ÊWhat can I say? ÊI like my meat! :)

My friend is obsessed with House. He would eat there every time he could after work. It's good asian fusion cuisine and is pretty light. The Unagi appetizer is out of this world. Even if you don't like avocado you'll like it, just amazing. The fish dishes are also fantastic.

ÊIt's too bad that it is in North Beach so parking is near impossible, but the food is well worth it.

This restaurant is amazing! ÊI would consider it the best restaurant I have ever eaten at! ÊNot only is the food very good, but it is also one of the healthiest restaurants around. ÊMost of their ingredients come directly from the source, I think they call it "farm to table." ÊI don't even remember what I got (I went a couple of years ago), but I plan to go back the next I am in San Fran! The restaurant is very small and is probably best for 2.

I saw The House reviewed on PBS/Channel9's "Check Please" and had to try it out, and it did not disappoint. The flavors were both strong and subtle...and frequently suprising combinations all served with eye-catching presentations. Everything we tried that day was both surprising and excellent -- from starters like the oysters on the half shell (with spicy cilantro mignonette), and Maine crab cakes (with pickled ginger remoulade) to the entrees like the grilled ahi tuna (with spicy mustard aioli) and chicken breast (with roasted portabella white truffle oil sauce). Quite a find...and I'll definitely be coming back to North Beach for Asian-American fusion.

If a restaurant that calls itself "asian fusion" and has perfect / near perfect reviews from over a 100 Asian yelpers, then I would bet my life that 1) it is really asian fusion, and 2) it is really FU***** good. ÊThe House is this restaurant and #1 and #2 apply. I've been going here for over 7 years. ÊI was an "asian fusion" virgin coming here having no idea of what to expect. ÊI'm not Mr. PRO-ASIAN or cringe when I see interracial dating, so I had a open mind when my dishes came. ÊMy first foreplay experience was the soft shell crab appetizer. ÊI nearly cried eating it. ÊIn fact, I nearly cried just looking at it. ÊIt had crisp fried noodles sticking out of it. ÊAnd they were like 3 feet long! ÊThe crab was perfectly fried and the light delicate dipping sauce (not soy or ponzu, but something asian) was a perfect compliment. ÊThe guts of the crab were so delicate, yet flavorful, that I almost shed a tear. ÊThen, ÊI had the fried salmon roll. ÊThe wasabi dipping sauce had a nice kick and the salmon was rare on the inside. ÊAnother tear almost shed. ÊNow, after the foreplay, I had my first time. ÊI seriously saw rays of sunlight coming down from the ceiling and shining on my dish. ÊChilean Sea Bass. ÊI know, that was 7 years ago and they haven't served it in a long time. ÊBut, please, let me continue. ÊOh my god, my first bite was utter bliss. ÊJust dissolved in my mouth after 2 chews. ÊI was sad it took so few chews because the flavor was so vivid. ÊFlamebroiled flavor hits first, not like Burger King, but like cooking on a Japanese Hibachi. ÊNext hits the delicate chilean sea bass flavor that I can't explain, only hint at to people who know. ÊThe noodles and green beans were so simple, yet perfect with my bass. ÊThe dipping sauce went perfect (light soy sauce type) and that was it. ÊI was really sad afterwards. ÊThen, I had the cuddling. ÊIt came in the form of Mango Tapioca Pudding. ÊIt was such a powerful denouement to my perfect meal. ÊAll I can say is get it for dessert. ÊIt is awesome. ÊBest meal of my life, mostly because I remember it so perfectly. ÊI have had tastier and more lavish and more exciting, but you never forget your first time. ÊTrust me.

I had heard so many marvelous reviews of The House from foodie friends before it was finally my turn to go that I was absolutely certain it would fall short of my lofty expectations. Not so. Ê The menu was decidedly non-vegetarian, which could have been cause for concern had our server not been quick to suggest that I try the "warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak"--minus the angus flatiron steak. ÊBravo! ÊIt would not be hyperbole to say that it was probably the most delicious dish I have had. ÊEver. Other things we enjoyed: the cozy atmosphere. ÊTwo bottles of champagne. ÊThe waiter's offering for us to spend the night at the restaurant since they were out of bread pudding and wouldn't have a new batch ready until the morning. ÊThe lone diner at the table across from us who was reading...uh no, that's not a book he's staring down at; he's actually stone-drunk and passed out at the table. Ê(Important note: If you are to "fall asleep" at the table at The House, they will put your unfinished wine in a paper bag and escort you out to the curb and into a cab.)

We waited outside with the bums and hookers for 20 min. despite arriving 5 minutes prior to our 9PM reservation. I was so thirsty that I bought a can of Coke and bottle of Crown at the LIQ across the street and drank all of it. This lubrication probably made me enjoy my meal a bit more because the food was rather unremarkable. I had Salmon she had Steak and noodles and they were both good but not mind-blowing by any means. The food is the highlight of this place though, as the decor is dismal and the interior is very cramped. With all the great eats in this area I won't be coming back anytime soon; no real problems but I think SF has way better spots on offer!

I am very tempted to dock them another star for the customer service during my dining experience here, but I really enjoyed the food soo the four solid stars go to the FOOD, but I still must comment on things. As everyone should know, parking around North Beach is impossible to find! So make sure you leave early enough to make your reservations or else they will give your table away if you're late. And maybe it's my fault for assuming they will call me (since they did ask for my number) to confirm if I'm still coming, but make sure you call THEM if you're running late. Our party was about 15 minutes late and because we did not call them, they gave away our seats and told us the next table available will be ours. Fine that's acceptable, but what I do not get is that there were two tables open that they could have easily pushed together for our party but they did not. I thought, maybe those two separate tables are reserved. 30 minutes later.. a couple comes in with NO reservations and gets seated immediately in one of the two open tables. I was a little angry but I still thought, okay maybe the OTHER one is reserved so that is why they could not push it together for us. Then another 15 minutes later, a couple with reservations came BUT the waitress who told us to wait had asked them if they wanted to sit here (the open table I've been eyeing the whole time) or another table in the back. So basically... I was late for MY reservations for 15 minutes, but had to wait over 45 minutes for a table when there was tables right in front of me available to put together THE ENTIRE TIME. *BIG SIGHHHH* Anyways..... on to the food. We ordered: AHI TUNA APPETIZER - It was decent, but not great.. I would like it a lot better if they were lighter with the wasabi DEEP FRIED SALMON ROLL - I really enjoyed this appetizer. I loved the crunchy outside with the slightly rare salmon packed inside and the kick from the hot mustard. The cabbage salad that came with it was sweet and refreshing too. ROASTED UNAGI WITH RICE - My favorite of the three. It's a simple appetizer, just a long roasted piece of unagi ontop of avocado and rice but it was soooooo good!! I used to be a big fan of unagi until I ate it so much that I got sick of it, but I think after last night, I am back on the unagi bandwagon! STEAK WITH WASABI NOODLES - The steak was really tender and I liked the flavor of the noodles. It was not too heavy with wasabi. The noodles kind of reminds me of those thick Shanghai noodles. A good entree, but nothing spectacular. GRILLED AHI TUNA - Of all the grilled/seared ahi tuna entrees I have had, this one is by farrrrr my favorite! It was just the perfect combination of flavors and texture. I loved the crispy veggie vermicelli on top of the perfectly grilled and soft tuna on the bed of spinach all ontop of rice with the spicy aioli. If I was to ever come out to deal with parking to eat in North Beach again, it would be for this dish. BLACK COD WITH SUSHI - The fish is soooo soft and tender and it went well with the sweet sauce. I liked the long sushi they placed ontop of it. It was a simple tasting one like a California Roll but I think it was a good addition to the fish. So aside from my little unhappy moment while waiting for our seats, I loved the food here. I would love to come back here again, but maybe only if I'm around the area already or get dropped off because North Beach... you are a nightmare!

appetizer: salmon roll The salmon roll itself was okay, i mean the presentation is pretty neat but the appetizer itself isnt anything super special. BUT with the wasabi sauce was amazing! it was also kinda cool how i expected a typical sushi sorta "salmon roll" but it wasnt like that at all. main course: pork chops with pomegranate sauce and carrot mash potatoes wow. amazing! i dont normally eat pork, but this was a really good choice! it was cooked PERFECTLY and was reallly filling as well. the sauces that came along with the pork chop was deeelicious as well. mm.. dessert: chocolate ganache cake with coffee ice cream wow, this was the perfect ending to a perfect meal! i shared this dessert with my sister and i am glad i did because i dont think i could have finished it all by myself. the chocolate cake was perfectly smooth and wasnt overwhelming with sweetness. the coffee ice cream was a wonderful, refreshing addition.

Came here this past sunday night for me and my boyfriend's 2 month anniversary dinner. He had made reservations for 8:00pm and we got there a little early. ÊWhen you first walk in, you notice the place is fairly small. However, the interior is very modern with clean wooden decor giving it a warm, comfortable feeling like you were in "a house." Oddly enough though, there was no hostess stand, so I was a little confused where to check in for our reservation. We stood at the front by the door for maybe 10 minutes or so before somebody came up to us and asked how many people were in our party. We told them we had reservations, and they told us to wait while they checked on our table. After awhile we were finally seated. If you're claustrophobic, I dont recommend this place because the spaces between the tables are very tight. But it didnt bother me, personally. We ordered half a dozen of the fresh oysters for appetizers, and they were pretty good! The sauce they give you with it is slightly sweet, but spicy adding a little zest to the freshness of the oysters. My boyfriend ordered some beer that i have never heard of, which if you notice on the menu, there are alot of beers that they dont sell at regular chain restaurants. I ended up ordering a sparkling wine, i forgot the name of it though, but it was really good. For meals, i ended up getting the Niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce and he got the Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. For the price of the meals, they gave you a generous amount that filled us up no doubt! The presentation of the food was amazing too! Our server was very tentative and cleared our dirty dishes right away and got us a second round of drinks while we looked through the dessert menu. We ended up not getting any dessert but my boyfriend got the almond cookies to go for my parents. (which my mom tried the next day and said they were very good, but very buttery) Overall, I was very impressed with this restaurant. The whole experience was almost perfect, but minus 1 star for the first impression it gave me when we first walked in. If the servers had some recognition of the people walking in rather have them just standing around in the front for over 10 minutes then this would be a 5 star restaurant.

I usually order the sea bass, which is excellent, as are all the appetizers I've tried (oysters, calamari, tempura string beans, salmon roll). The wasabi noodles are also to die for. There is a nice selection of good quality sake which complement the food nicely. This is a fun place to go with a date, a friend, or a small group.

Out of town friends from Kentucky prompted us to try The House again since they moved from their original Irving St location to the heartbeat of North Beach. ÊAlso, TH was featured on Check Please, Bay Area and all three foodies raved about it http://blogs.kqed.org/foÉ... First, reservations require a credit card just to make sure no shows don't disrupt the already hectic/efficiency of greeting/seating/serving. ÊAllow time to stalk street parking or a short walk from the Vallejo/Powell public garage. Menu is mainly seafood based with creatively matched ingredients that work very well to produce a fantastic entree. Ê Reserve your selection until the friendly server describes the specials of the night. ÊOur night had three entree specials - Ahi, spareribs and a braised pork butt topped with a small piece of foie gras (perfect crust on the outside and fork tender on the inside). Every dish including the Seabass on the menu was prepared to perfection and the presentation very nicely done. ÊSee my photo posting of these dishes. Ê Every plate on the table - clean enough to just load directly into a cheap dishwasher, nothing to scrap or rinse. If you're into a traditional Belgium beer that's dark and tasty, try the 1554 - even the temperature of the beer is perfect, not too BudLight cold! Highly recommended, make reservations, give credit card, take cab or park and enjoy The House! ÊI agree with the 600+ reviews.

I went there for a double date on Friday night, with reservations at 10 PM. When we first arrived, the waitress told us it would "be a few minutes", and the few minutes turned to 45 minutes of waiting outside in the cold. The manager compensated our long wait with fried salmon rolls. Despite the fact that I do not believe my 45 minute wait can be replaced with an appetizer, it was delicious. The black lychee tea was chilled and perfect, along with my sea bass entree.

May a 3.5? I remember going here back in college and enjoying this place a lot. Back then it looks more like a house with separate rooms. Now it's all squishy and you're basically eating on top of the next person. Food was good, but not spectacular. Service was kinda slow and mediocre. You feel like you're bothering people when you try to get their attention. I don't like that very much. The special ribs of the day was tough and dry. The crab cake was really good! Everyone enjoyed the sea bass and the wasabi noodles didn't even take like wasabi to me at all. The rib eye steak was tender and flavorful, although it was a little to charred on the outside. A good spot to eat at, but I think I had higher expectations for this place...

I was expecting a lot more from the House given all the positive reviews, but after dining here I find the restaurant very over-rated. ÊThe rib eye steak was decent, but outside of the steak was a bit charred. Same with another steak we got that came with noodles. Crab cakes were good, cod was decent. Ribs we had were horrible - they were hard and overcooked. Overall the dining experience was just 'meh' for me. to be fair, 2.5 stars would be about right.

Steps to get ready for your House experience: 1. Make a reservation 2. Take a shower 3. Put on your elastic-waist pants 4. Bring your high-limit credit card Here's why you must abide by the steps above: This place is packed *always* and to the gills. ÊWe came in on a Friday night about 8:30 with a reservation and still waited about 10 minutes for a table. ÊPlus, there is no waiting area (or it is a waiting area for midgets), so you are basically stuck drooling over everyone else's meals if you have to wait. Your table will likely be mere inches from your neighbors' so do us all a favor and clean up a bit. ÊWe had no problems with this, but just a warning - not a lot of space in here! Now the good part... FOOOOOD! ÊWe ordered a half bottle of sake and some Sapporos to start. ÊYou can't get anything smaller than a half bottle of sake, so along with your elastic-waist pants I would recommend your best pair of drinking shoes. ÊNext up were the steamed mussels with shrimp broth. ÊI've never been much of a shellfish fan, but these are excellent mussels. ÊSalty broth and just enough mussels to split between two hungry people. ÊFor mains I ordered the sesame soy glazed salmon and he got the flatiron steak with wasabi noodles (cooked rare!). ÊThe food came out quickly as we devoured the mussels and was presented very beautifully; see everyone else's pictures above. ÊThe salmon was perfectly floating atop a bed of bitter greens and the glaze added a nice crunch. ÊThere was a ton of broth, but it was very tasty. ÊHis steak was a huge serving and the wasabi noodles were just hot enough. ÊOverall, we definitely enjoyed ALL of the above. ÊOf course we got dessert - a coconut creme brulee with passionfruit puree on top. ÊIN. CRED. IBLE. ÊThe brulee was so sweet and the puree so tart - it was totally a perfect match. ÊI broke out my Happy Food Dance and it was only the first date, so you know it was tasty... Not cheap here (see #4 above), but definitely a special treat and highly recommended if you are sick of eating Italian food in NB.

Well prepared dishes with excellent presentation and sizable portions. I came here for lunch with 4 other coworkers. There were no complaints about anything that was ordered. The fried salmon roll was a great way to kick off the meal. The wasabi noodles with grilled salmon was flavorful and full of wasabi goodness. If you like fish this is the place to go. Two of my coworkers got the butterfish special, another got the sea bass and the other got the sol. Everyone left with their tummies happy. Desserts were nothing to rave about but definitely hit the spot. The apple crumble ala mode is pretty classic and tasty. I was a bit disappointed they didn't have desserts with more of an asian flare like something with green tea or red bean in it.

My friend, JL, insisted I try this place on a Friday night without a reservations. When we got there, the non-reservations wait, according to the hostess, was an hour. We waited two hours (we should have left earlier but kept being told we were at the top of the non-reservations list). The food itself was ok, but I don't think I would wait two hours for food that didn't blow me away. However, maybe if we had gone on a less busy evening or had reservations, my expectations wouldn't have been so high and the food would've tasted better. I had the salmon in a miso soy broth. It tasted pretty good but got cold quickly since we were near the door, which even at 9:45pm still had a steady stream of people coming in and out (and one of our fellow diners kept going out for a smoke and coming back in without closing the door behind him... what a jerk. Within thirty minutes of him being seated, he had managed to get dirty looks from half the restaurant). Maybe I'll try it again, but only with a reservation.

5 stars across the board. the service was great, quick and attentive while giving you your space. the food was fantastic, lives up to its rave reviews! and the atmosphere was a little crammed but really nice. we started with the deep fried salmon which was great, i loved the wasabi sauce it came with. both entrees were amazing, the sea bass truly does melt in your mouth... it was hard to believe that was once fish and the cod special was a great treat and i think was the winner. the house is a perfect spot for a date night or special occasion for you. come and enjoy!

in my mind, north beach is usually home to good italian food places and mediocre tourist joints...however off the main strip (kinda in view of the stinking rose) is the house...and such a simple name packs the most amazing food!!! dishes are delicious and portions are hearty...for a group of 7 the yums were numerous and too many to count...it's been a couple weeks since i was there for dinner with NY-J and her friends but the memory of my pork entree with pomegranate currant sauce is making my mouth water... i do think the menu changes frequently, so i can almost promise you'll like EVERYTHING you get...well i can't promise you that i guess, given i don't know you, but send what you don't like my way, and i'll eat it...

I can't believe I had never eaten here before!! My friend and I shared the seabass dinner, and the kobe beef dinner special. The consistency of the seabass was so on point, it literally melted in my mouth. ÊThat comes with the wasabi noodles and green beans. ÊThe kobe beef was a special of the night. ÊEverything about the dish down to the cauliflower was so tasty and flavorful. ÊI've never had such a good meal! ÊFor appetizers, we had the salmon skin rolls, asparagus, and ahi. All very good, but I could have skipped the asparagus...Service was great, except she had forgotten our drinks and I had to remind her. Êand maybe I'm just a fatass and thought the portions were little, but I got hungry again half an hour after I left the restaurant. ÊOverall, really good food and great experience. ÊPrice point per dish is around $20-$30+...so once I have a little more money in my pocket, I'm definitely excited to try the other dishes this place has to offer.

This should go at the end, but i decided it deserved to be at the top since it was the best pork chop I have ever had in my LIFE. My Lady ordered the Niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce. Every bite felt like a new experience to eating, like it was my first time. Enough said! i don't want to ruin the surprise. GO TRY IT NOW. AHHHH, the long awaited HOUSE( Asian American Fusion). This Place was planned long before we stepped foot in SF. Amazing might I say. We started with a half dozen raw oysters with this special sauce for the oysters. I cant put my finger on it but it was GOOOOOD. ÊIt definitely had Vinegar, tobasco, and some sort of chile paste (Sriracha perhaps?) VERY SPICY (not for the weak). Please try it and let me know. On to the main courses. I had a Ribeye (medium rare) with mashed potatoes and veggies. The edges were a little burnt, kinda crispy if I may say so. However the inside was cooked to perfection. Ê Refer to paragraph 2.

Dear House, Can I move in? Seriously. From start to finish, this was one of the best meals of my life. It's so rare that a place in SF stands up to its reputation...or in this case exceeds. I am always skeptical of trying new places for fear of disappointment, and this is one place that does not disappoint. 10 PM vtines dinner so we were starving What we got: Bottle of Piedmont Nebbiolo, BBQ Oysters, seared scallops, ahi appetizer, sea bass, skate special, andddd chocolate cake with coffee ice cream. Highlights: Scallops were unbelievable as were oysters. Sea bass was the standout entrŽe, but the coconut broth was exceptional with the skate. And that chocolate cake. Good Lord. Eh's: Ahi wasn't for me. Maybe I am sensitive to wasabi, but it was overpowering. Still yummy, but a relative let down. It definitely is an understated place in terms of ambiance and decor, but cute nonetheless. If you're looking for dim lighting and all the bells and whistles, this place is not for you. Personally, I have been to enough places in SF that deliver the ambiance and skimp on what matters the most (to me at least), the food. If you're in it for the food and the food only, House is your kind of place.

The unagi avocado sandwich needs to board a plane and transport itself to New York.

Êgo ahead, dip the dinner rolls in it too :) the angus ribeye was encrusted w/ garlic, so it's not a good selection if you're trying to impress your date. Êthe ribeye had plenty of marble.. almost too much, wish they offered a NY strip. Êit was a small price for such a large quality cut, very tasty too!

This was a great Yelp find. We've gone to The House so many times in the past 2 months it's kindda ridiculous... It's my favorite restaurant in SF right now... (I have yet to try Gary Danko)... The food is soooooo gooooood!! I think by now we've tried EVERYTHING on their menu, my fav is probably the wasabi noodles with steak, or the ribeye, or the seabass (i really can't decide)... the desserts are all great as well... they also have Chimay (in bottles only), which is pretty awesome for a restaurant... The service is always great, we usually can get a table for 2 the same night, and one time we had a birthday party there and the hostess was very accommodating. I love how the restaurant is small and intimate as well...

i have always been a fan of the house - i have been going there for about 8 years, its such a great spot and while i always see that its full, its never that hard to get a table there. Êi especially like their seafood. Êmost of their dishes have an asian style, but its not so specific that everyone can't find something to like. Êmost recently i went there with a group of friends and everyone enjoyed their meal. Êwe shared the shrimp and chive dumplings, bean tempura, and asparagus to start. Êi dont care for asparagus myself, but the other 2 appetizers were delicious. Êi had the fish special for my entree which was delicious. Êtheir specials are almost always great.

I'm starting to come to the conclusion that maybe Asian fusion just isn't a good idea for fine dining in general...Made reservations for 7pm on a Saturday and got seated right on time, although the hostess' attitude was more beezy than friendly. ÊAs you all know, this place is tiny so reservations are a good idea for dinner. ÊThe layout also makes things kind of weird, as they fit tables into the narrow hallway leading to the back where the lone restroom is. ÊI didn't pay much attention, but it seems that people eating in the "hallway" area get less servce than those in the square front area, an unfortunate side-effect of having limited space to work with. Ê For the food, we started off with the Fried Salmon Rolls which were finger lickin good (leave it to me to take a fine dining experience and class it up by eating something with my hands). ÊA disclaimer, the mustard sauce that accompanies the rolls may be a little too strong for some, so go light and pile on more as you go. ÊOtherwise you gonna be sneezing all over your food. ÊWith that in mind, the rolls without the sauce were just aight, the sauce definitely completes them and makes them more hearty. ÊI ordered the Wasabi Noodles with Flat-Iron Steak which came piled with kimchee and some julienned cucumbers. ÊThe noodles were just ok, literally tasting like udon that were stir-fried with soy sauce and a dash of wasabi. ÊI'll probably try and make it at home since it seems easy enough to do. ÊThe steak was cooked perfectly medium with a dark outside and a deliciously bloody inside mmmmmm. ÊHowever, the steak didn't really have any flavor to it other than its own natural goodness and some of the flavors it absorbed from the kimchee and noodles. ÊMy friend got the Sea Bass which came with green beans and surprise, surprise, udon! ÊAs with the steak, the sea bass was cooked very well, and like all sea bass, tasted very good. ÊIt didn't have any extra flavor or seasoning though which kind of let us down again though. ÊJust another well cooked piece of protein that happens to be delicious on its own. ÊThe udon was like the base version of the wasabi ones, stir-fried with soy sauce but didn't get the fancy-pants wasabi treatment. ÊThe green beans pulled off the same feat, tasting like something I'd make at home cause they were so basic. Ê Now, I'm all for simplicity and home-style foods, but this place is billed as a fine-dining experience so I should be experiencing flavors that are complex and different. ÊThe fact that I could essentially make both of the entrees at home must be a testament to how good a chef I am...not haha. ÊIt just struck me as being a too simple and not quite the foodie mecca that it's been painted to be on here. ÊIf anything it'd make a good lunch stop or a safe, solid dinner, but I don't recommend this place as a must try if you're wanting a sensational tasting meal.

Make reservations before coming to this place. I should have ordered the sea bass like my friend suggested, but I figured since 3 of the 4 people were already ordering sea bass, I should try something else.

I love to go there for lunch when friends visiting town (good reason for spending a little more on lunch), sure it's more than your average 5-7 bucks lunch, but for only a couple dollars more, you are enjoying fine california pan asian cousine at a clean nicely decorated restaurant at Little Italy. Sipping lychee ice tea while having my tempura ahi tuna roll as appetizer, entree i love the eel avocado sandwich ($10) or all time favorite grilled sea bass, many likes their garlic or wasabi (mild) flavored stir fried noodles with options of chicken or salmon ($10-$12) can't beat the price for very decent lunch!

The first time we went here we'd had a lot of mojitos first at 850 Montgomery Cigar Bar, so the evening's a bit blurry, but we had some really good food. The setting was kind of odd but there was a big group of us so we had a blast. The second time we went here was for lunch, and I really really enjoyed the food again, but as I gulped down water all afternoon to fight my dehydration, my fears were confirmed - definitely an MSG culprit. If you can handle MSG, check out the food, but if you don't want to have a dry throat and headache all afternoon, you may want to take a pass on this one. Great halibut though!

Another little secret hot spot, tucked away in the city, that packs a real punch. Had the Ahi Tuna Tartar, and was pleasantly surprised by the freshness and gorgeous presentation. Also tasted the tempura Soft Shell Crab appetizer, which was to die for. Main course was a bit more bland than my other menu selections, but was tasty and perfectly cooked. Ate some of my boyfriend's NY steak meal and was in HEAVEN. Then, the dessert. I LOVE creme brulee, but my boyfriend always jokes that it isn't very creative. Even HE loved this one.

no real reason to write a review, i suppose, but i wanted to give a shout out to my new friend stacey the server. initially, her exhausted yet precise rote recitation of the specials sort of weirded me out, but a little chatty banter and we were off the races. i'm from l.a., we traded restaurant recommendations. next stop: bone marrow flan at cut -- hopefully she'll get to try the steak tartare at ford's filling station. i've never said this about anyone before, but she's a real peach. i find it strange that this place has no a/c but i guess i'm too angeleno to comprehend the lack of it. just thought i'd mention it for the sweaty people out there who might feel uncomfortable without it.

By far my most frequented restaurant in the City. ÊI've been a big fan since 1998 when I went regularly to the House on 9th. ÊBut since that one has closed, I often find myself going to the one in North Beach. ÊThe menu has plenty of winners like the unagi on rice and ahi tuna appetizers. ÊIt's been a while since my favorite dish the Hawaiian Butterfish was on the menu (but I think it's seasonal). ÊI always order to share and the sea bass is a must. ÊThe steaks are also very good there. ÊOpal and the rest of the waitstaff are friendly and unpretentious. ÊThe prices are reasonable for the quality of food and ambiance. ÊI almost always take out of towners here when they first visit and they're always impressed. ÊBy far my favorite restaurant in SF because it does Asian Fusion the way it was meant to be.

Not that it's needed, but I'll add to the praise. ÊGood service, artfully presented dishes that are exotic, but not so pretentious that one needs an encyclopedia to figure out what in a dish. ÊAnd for a classy place, I think reasonably priced with portions that are more than satisfactory. ÊCaesar salad with crispy scallops was delightful. ÊDeep fried salmon roll with Chinese Hot mustard was inspired. ÊWarm wasabi house noodles with Angus flatiron steak ($17) was excellent and delicately seasoned. ÊMy only complaint is their website which I think could use a little touch up and some more detail, but maybe their motif is simplicity. ÊAll items had a sense that the chef truly cared about each and every dish that left his purview.

Nice Rack! I went there last night for my birthday after a day of drinking in North Beach and I don't know if it was the alcohol, but the food was delicious! Whenever I order the rack of lamb at restaurants, I usually get three tiny pieces with one square inch of meat on each. Not at the House! The rack was huge and juicy and they were complemented with a light mix of pickled zucchini. The tuna tartare was out of this world, but beware, the tuna is marinated in wasabi and has a serious kick. The mussels were amazing- I literally drank the leftover juice. Also, the kobe skirt steak special melts in your mouth and the fries were light, but had the perfect amount of grease. Finish it off with the apple crumble and you have yourself one mouth-watering meal.

I've been here twice, and it's definitely not the last they saw of me. I've tasted a couple of the dishes and hope to try everything on their menu. When here you definitely have to try the flank steak as well as the sea bass, and a couple of the desserts they have (sorry forgot what they were called). Parking is a female dog since it is in the Grant Ave. alleyish area of North Beach, but it's almost worth getting towed away for... I should know, it happened to me. =P

what a great date night....the bf and i came here for our 1 year dinner before we headed off to watch wicked...we didnt want to expect too much especially after reading raving reviews on yelp, but it definitely surpassed our expectations we had reservations on friday at 530 and got seated immediately...the place was pretty empty around that time...but it got crowded around 630-ish our server let us know what the specials were that day (man, she has a super good memory) and we ordered the tempura soft shell crab as our appetizer instantly...along with a bottle of the two hands shiraz (yum! i love australian wine) - he: flank steak with wasabi noodles (tasty...the noodles had a hint of the wasabi so it wasnt too overpowering) - me: grilled sea bass (melt in your mouth goodness) - desert: blueberry bread pudding w/strawberry ice cream hands down, now one of my most favorite restaurants in the city....apparently the bill wasnt too bad according to the bf good food +vip parking (found street parking about a block away from the restaurant Ê+ from the orpheum) +good bottle of wine +entertaining musical +spending it all w/my love = a perfect night Ê:)

My friend says this is his favorite resto in the city, so we finally went with him to experience this Asian fusion resto. We ordered the tuna tartare and fried smelt as appetizers and the sea bass and sirloin steak with the wasabi noodles as the main dishes. The appetizers were pretty good, the sea bass was definitely melt in your mouth delicious but the noodles were so-so for me, my dad makes this kind of fried noodles when we have nothing else to eat, so for $24 I expected better sides with the sea bass. And my boyfriend enjoyed his steak but it wasn't amazing. The tables are very tight and packed and service is decent. Overall, it was good but not one of my favorites.

This place was suggested to me by a local. I called a couple hours in advance and made reservations (HINT). It is located in the artsy district surrounded by restaurants, strip joints, and classical bookstores. The place was packed and there was no room to wait. The space is pretty small which is why you feel like a sardine. Let's just say you get to know who you are sitting next to very well as you are basically sitting on top of them. This makes it easy to steal a few bites of their food when they aren't paying attention (jk I did not commit this act, though I was tempted). For appetizers we started off with the fried salmon rolls. Deeply fried and crunchy on the outside, but soft and juicy on the inside, with an excellent sauce. I had the steak and my bf had the chicken. We were both fighting for the steak, but since I got to choose the place, I won. Both were very delicious. The steak was perfect, incredibly succulent. The service was great too even though they are busy. I will definitely be coming back here.

Went there tuesday night after reading the ton of reviews on here. Made a reservation for 7:30pm, the time at which my 3 friends and I showed up, but we weren't seated until 8pm. This was frustrating as we wanted a 6:30pm reservation to begin with and we were all very hungry, but the chef compensated by giving us a free appetizer upon finally seating us. This was the deep fried salmon roll which was pretty tasty. I don't eat fried things but the salmon I picked out from within it was darn good. I found their wines by the glass list to be fairly pricy. Perhaps this is in part due to the fact that I spent the last two weeks in Europe paying 2-3 euro per glass. Anyways, I ended up passing on the wine as none of the reds called out my name and the rest of the group all got beers. They have a very nice beer selection including Belgian and Czech beers which are both great. They also have an extensive tea list and many other beverages. I ended up ordering the Seared Ahi tuna dish with mashed potatoes and spinach with a wasabi sauce. The waitress mentioned that they can make it over rice if I prefer, but I thought the mash with the wasabi sauce would be pretty darn tasty. Unfortunately, I was served the dish over rice. This was still pretty tasty but I have a feeling the mash would have really made the meal. Because I was ravenous at this point and didn't want to wait for my food any further, I didn't bother letting our waitress know about the mistake. I'm sure they would have been happy to make the change though --- everyone was very pleasant. Oh yes, we also ordered the shrimp dumplings which were served steamed. They were good, but nothing to rave about as I've apparently forgot about them until now. Ooops. So back to my tuna dish...the wasabi sauce was great --- very much like the green goodness one puts on sushi. It made my nose tickle at the right moments without being painful. The spinach was well prepared and seemed fairly fresh. The rice was rice and the seared Ahi tuna was a bit bland to be honest. It was coated in some sort of spice rub before being seared but it tasted like plain old maguro. I'm not a big fan of red tuna, but I usually enjoy it with some kind of flavored crust when it is pan seared. SO, I think the sauce saved the dish for me and I would have definitely enjoyed it more with the mashed potatoes, but overall it was good. I don't think I would order it again however. My boyfriend got the Australian Lamb shank special and it was pretty darn good. The lamb was very tender and served on a bed of heirloom tomato salad. He finished his dish and licked his fingers. Yum. My one friend ordered the Black Cod special and that was phenomenal. It was in a light miso (we thought) sauce served with asparagus and I think the mashed potatoes. I only tried the fish and it was perfectly prepared and very flavorful. My other friend ordered some kind of steak, which I didn't try, but it looked good and he devoured it whole. Finally, we ordered a dessert. I really wanted to try the chocolate cake but there was no other takers so we ended up with the Apple Crumble ala mode. It was fantabulous! I loved it and I don't normally like these sorts of things. The ice cream was very creamy and the apple crumble was not too sweet, not too tart. Just right. So, will I be going back? Well, yes...but mainly for the chocolate cake and the crme brulee. I'd also like to try the pomegranate pork and see if they get that Black Cod dish back my friend had...it was awesome.

I had a really unpleasant experience at this restaurant. Don't get me wrong; the food was great, but the service we were given by our waitress was terrible.

I seldom go back to places in city since I'm only here for six months, but this place was worth it, for the quality and the price.

Our server was also extremely nice and explained the specials to us numerous times because we couldn't decide and kept forgetting what he was saying, haha. I got the black cod and Drew got something else (I forgot what....) but both were delicious. We also got this california roll with something else...and another appetizer. I can't remember everything we ordered! But I do remember going on about how amazing they tasted. However, like all pricey trendy restaurants, portions were a bit small :P

I have to admit, I am not a big fan of fusion food, and I think the menu prices are a little bit too pricey for lunch. ÊBut, the restaurant offers friendly and accommodating service, and I don't have any complaints about the food -- I really enjoyed the "blue lake bean tempura with pickled ginger soy" appetizer. ÊActually, considering the portion sizes of the noodle dishes, I'd say the prices are pretty reasonable. ÊAppetizers are in the $9 range, and entrees are between $9-15. ÊNote that if you are attending with a group, there is a max of two credit cards, so be sure to bring cash.

So my aunt was raving about this place so I figured I'd stop by with the family while I was on vacation. As soon as my aunt heard that we were coming here, proceeds to speed to SF to have some with us, considering my aunt never wakes up before 12pm, this place must be really something. The service appeared to be very attentive for other tables, but not for our table. I don't know if it was due to my ghetto Chinese grandmother being a little on the loud side, or maybe because my aunt is kind of loud too, but I could definitely detect a service discrepancy between our table and others. Not necessarily bad, but not as fast with our water refills etc. Since I am still in college my family believes I am always starving, so I tried practically everything on their lunch menu thanks to my family since everyone put nearly a quarter of their dish on my plate. The House wasabi noodles with grilled salmon was well-prepared. The salmon was perfectly cooked and was moist and flaky. The glaze was wonderful and the noodles were good too, but I think the chef was a bit heavy-handed on the sauce. The unagi sandwich was very good. The sweetness of the unagi with the creaminess of the avocado was great. The salad would have been good if it wasn't over-dressed causing the lettuce to appear limp. I also tried two of their specials, the miso-glazed black cod and the soft-shell crab sandwich. The miso-glazed black cod was again very well-cooked, very moist and served on a bed of vegetables and white rice. Again the glaze was a bit much since it was dripping all over the vegetables in somewhat of a puddle however it was delicious with the white rice. The soft-shell crab sandwich was good, but I prefer the unagi avocado sandwich. I was very disappointed in the lychee iced tea. It was literally one lychee from a can in an unsweetened tea. It had no lychee taste unless you literally fished the one lychee out and ate in which you would be left with just tea. I've had better lychee iced tea at a Tapioca Express. Overall, the food was very good, if a bit oversauced and salty at times. Avoid the lychee black tea, and I could overlook the service, but keep an eye out.

This place had such great reviews that I had to try it. I was a bit worried about it being Asian fusion, since I have not had any good Asian fusion food in the past. (I like my Asian food as authentic as possible.) But this place really hit the spot. It got everything right. All the flavors were intense and amazing. We had the Angus flatiron steak with mashed potatoes and the sea bass with stir-fried udon with red cabbage and sauteed green beans. The steak was tender and was slightly reminiscent of Korean bbq in the flavorings. The sea bass was just perfectly grilled and the soy sauce it was served with was full of flavor. Needless to say, our plates were completely empty. I also love how the restaurant is almost hidden and is very unpretentious. It's a truly special dining experience...quiet and intimate, with absolutely perfect food. Just make sure to make reservations.

I went for dinner here a couple of weekends ago while I was in town for the weekend. Obviously a super happening place, it was completely packed to the brim, seated diners and people waiting by the door. I always wince at the whole Asian or anything "fusion" trend but they had some interesting and innovative sounding dishes. I had one of the specials: sea bass in a curry sauce with mussels. The fish was tender, a huge portion (I definitely didn't finish it), the sauce was the most enjoyable part. It would've been lovely if it was served with a bit of rice. The mussels were quite good. If you're looking for a quiet spot then this probably isn't the best place as it gets pretty loud and rowdy with everybody's elses conversations all converging into one. I would definitely go back again to try some of the other fare.

sea bass $20 eel sandwich $10? red velvet cake $8? Weekday lunch. I will not order sea bass again. Everyone said it was to die for but I rather live than eat this again for $20 and die. For $20 lunch, I ask for more creativity. As for eel sandwich, you can get the similar deal for $6.50 at Good Luck on Kearny. I saw other noodle dish that may be better. The red velvet cake was very good. But overall, I think it is rather overrated,

This is such a neat little restaurant, and it's also made me realize that moving to SF will make Yelping so hard! Every place has so many reviews already compared to Houston. I will say that the scallops appetizer on the specials were really good and so was the deep fried salmon roll. ÊI had the black cod, and the texture was great, but the sauce made it a little too salty for me. The maine crab roll was definitely something a little more different display-wise. ÊThey cut the roll almost vertically versus horizontally, and it was just different. I liked it. ÊThe taste was really great too! So everyone else was really satisfied with their dishes, and I just wish mine wasn't so salty. I'll probably go back, because this place is really reasonably priced for what you get.

So we're back! After months of neglecting this place, we made our visit back for valentines day! I've been craving steak for the longest time and told the boyfriend we need to go back to The House and get our fix on. The boyfriend and I both agreed it was time to retry this place and hopefully have better service than the last time we were there. Called in a week before Valentine's day and was told they were book sat and sun until 10pm. Wow.. i did not realize how popular this place was going to be. So the boyfriend and i risked it and came in on Sunday around 8pm. To our surprise, the host told us it would be a 45min wait, not bad. We walked around Chinatown to kill time due to it being Chinese new years that weekend so we went exploring. Came back an hr later and still waiting... FINALLY 9:20pm we're seated! If you've been there, you would know that this place is tiny, i mean tiny for it being so busy and crowed. We were seated in a cramped small table literally sitting 5 inches from the next table, but because we knew it was a busy night we were just thankful to be seated. Due to it being valentines day they had a special menu for the night serving special entrees they do not serve on the regular menu. We were a bit disappointed... until our food came out. For starters we had the miso clams with okra. OMFG it was delicious! It came in a small bowl with about 10-12 clams with a broth to die for. Triangle cut garlic bread was nicely stacked on the clams to be dipped in the broth. We both agreed it was the best dish we had ever had eating out. We were tempt to order seconds! But sadly we didn't because our food came out. I asked the server if they had this on the menu or even sometimes as a special during regular days and she explained it wasn't and it was the chefs special. It's a shame because it would definitely be a hit! So back to the night.. the boyfriend ordered the rib eye steak that comes with asparagus and mash potatoes. He loved it but didn't managed to finish it. I loved his potatoes, very light but also had the flavor of garlic that melted away in your mouth. The portions are decent and pars to the price you pay. I on the other hand ordered the only popular dish they normally serve that night which was the Chilean sea bass with green beans and garlic noodles. I was a bit taken back, i did not remember it being so greasy. As others have mentioned on yelp, the noodles are a bit too much and the green beans were drench with oil. My sea bass was also over cooked and not how i imagined; buttery and melting in my mouth. Maybe it was so busy the one of the cookers had his hand full and left the sea bass cooked in a min to long, but overall i enjoyed the appetizer so much that The House did justice and satisfied me all in all. Also the staff and our waitress was overly nice and attentive that it made the dinner pleasant. We both felt that the waitress was way better then the other waiter we had the last visit. She made us feel like we weren't just some 20 something year olds on a budget that weren't gonna tip at least 20% like the other older guests. I hate upscale places that treat their guest/customers like that. Treat me like others because really, in the end your earning your tip! We definitely tipped our waitress that night beyond 25% and left her a thank you note. Can't wait to comeback!

I've been to places where the reviews meet my expectations and let me tell you this place isn't one of them. Sure, the place has decent food but its way to expensive for the price. This place is small, by small I mean like its really small to the point that its hard to walk to the bathroom when the place is crowded. I had the infamous sea bass, even though the price is too much in my opinion the taste is pretty good. At first i didn't really like the combination of the crisp with the sauce but the flavour of the fish is pretty sweet. The service is prompt, the waitress seems to know what the menu is and i had a pretty good date here! Overall I was pretty satisfied. However, i wouldn't really recommend rating this place as a 5 because the food was just decent, not great...just decent. P.s: Wouldn't recommend this place for a large party, cause its gonna be pretty hard to walk inside with so many people in such a little place!

Meant to write this review some time ago. ÊInstead of sitting in traffic one night, my colleague and I went Êto "The House" for dinner. ÊIt's a very small dining area. ÊSince we didn't have any reservation, we waited 20 minutes. ÊThere is no waiting area since the restaurant is small so we waited outside. It was worth the wait. The unagi with avocado rice appetizer was delicious and seabass with ginger soy sauce was extremely tasty. ÊI tried a bite of the salmon glazed. ÊExcellent food and would love to come back to try the other dinner entrees. ÊBTW the chocolate dessert was awesome but I can't remember the name. Must come again.

i don't wanna sound the same as all the other reviewers... but the food is absolutely delicious! went here for an early birthday dinner on friday night and it was packed... make sure to make reservations or else you'll wait at least 30 minutes! we had the deep fried salmon as suggested by many yelpers... it was good, but i was a little disappointed cause the middle wasn't as rare as the pictures were shown. i had the seabass for my entree and it really was melt in your mouth delicious... it was "slap your momma" good. the noodles were a great surprise to the dish as well... they look plain and simple, but pack a lot of flavor. my friend had the pork chops and these weren't slap your momma good, these were slap your daddy good! everything worked so well on this dish and the pork was so moist and delicious. i actually wished i had gotten this dish, but it would have been way too much for me to eat. dessert was the coconut creme brulee with the passion fruit puree, maybe it's just me, but the coconut and the tangy passion fruit worked wonders for me. all in all, the meal was delicious and not too expensive. for the two of us with appetizers, entrees, one dessert and one glass of wine came out to a little over $70. definitely give this place a try, i doubt you'll be disappointed.

Food here was delectable. We went with two appetizer specials (a lobster salad where the lobster was fried and yet not greasy and a tuna sashimi with just a hint of ceviche). For the entree we shared the pork chop which was flavorful and surprisingly free of fat. All of the dishes were outstanding. The service was a little "too cool for school" but we were seated immediately despite the lack of reservations on a Friday night.

As of the first day of 2011, this place is still kicking ass. The fish entrees here were just superb tonight. Sea Bass (with green beans and wasabi noodles) was as perfectly cooked a piece of fish as you could imagine. Good crust on the outside and just melting inside. The ginger garlic soy sauce served on the side is very strong and kinda masks the lusciousness of the fish, but it's a good enough combo to merit dipping a few bites into it. Special tonight was skate with mussels in a faintly sweet sauce with coconut milk I think. Again perfectly cooked and the sauce was excellent. Appetizers weren't quite as magical but still great. Chopped salad and caesar salad with fried scallops tasty if maybe a tad overdressed. Mussels were big and plump and the garlic infused shrimp broth was very very good. Tablemate had the asparagus with roasted sesame dressing and she said it was also top-rate. Everything coming to all the tables around us looked inviting. We'll return soon to taste more.

I went here on prom night with my friends. It was delicious!!! So we had the crab cake (wow - what an odd shape.. i uploaded a picture), chilean sea bass (I felt guilty. but at least one endangered fish was split amongst four people), salmon in soy miso, and white curried shrimp salad (only four shrimp, but they were scrumptious). MMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmm and for dessert we had coconut passionfruit creme brulee, which tasted kind of funky, and chocolate cake. that was good. DELICIOUS CLEAN FUN!!!!!!!!!

This place is always pretty packed - but they do take reservations because it's a great place!! The fooood is delicious for Asian Fusion. I LOVE IT. The House is my favorite restaurant (or one of).. It's great for a date, to celebrate something special or just to go for fun. The menu isn't huge but it's decent with quality. The food is sooo flavorful and the portions are very generous. Extremely tasty with a great fusion sense. The restaurant can get pretty noisy because it's a small place, but the service is always there along with the different dishes. They also have different specials that change, so make sure you try the variety. Also, they have a Lychee iced tea thats good and the desserts are yummmy as well. Overall, this restaurant is one of the best!!

Agree with others - Solid competent cooking with fresh ingredients and creative presentation. Juicy fleshed butterfly fish and Chilean sea bass with flavorful searing technique. Hamachi ceviche was nice but flavor could be enhanced with mango slices. Wine by the glass selection was good. Definitely worth returning. Use reservations.

it was a long work week, and we needed to get out of the house. living in NB, it's very easy to get lost in the maze of mediocre Italian restaurants and just end up grabbing a burger at Buster's or pizza at Golden Boy. the House does a great Asian fusian-style menu. everything tasted very fresh. the portions are generous; we each had a small plate and a main course and dessert and were stuffed beyond belief. the sea bass, the scallops, the short ribs and the quail were all amazing and worth trying. i'd eat here again in a heartbeat. wait staff was attentive and we didn't see any roaches.

My guy brought me here recently for our anniversary and this was lovely! ÊThe place isn't very big but the atmosphere is cozy, not overwhelming and not pretentious. ÊI wouldn't exactly call the wait staff friendly, they seemed a bit reserved but perhaps they save the smiles for the regular customers. ÊThey were definitely very knowledgable and attentive though. ÊWe ordered the deep-fried salmon rolls which were great - very generous portion and also ordered the chive dumplings. ÊI expect places like this to be rather meagre on the portions so I was pleasantly surprised by this place. ÊBoth appetizers were very tasty (probably should have only gotten 1 of them!) and I also enjoyed the lightly pickled cucumbers with sesame seeds they brought to the table - very refreshing. ÊMy guy ordered the chicken with potatoes and for the truffle oil alone, the dish deserves a great review! ÊI had the grilled sea bass and it was simply delicious (and my first time having sea bass) and the green beans were perfectly seasoned, not an afterthought like so many places. Getting one of the few spots near the window is especially nice for North Beach people watching. ÊI definitely recommend making a reservation.

If you haven't tried The House yet- you need to stop on by to see what everyone is raving about! ÊAnd it's all about the Grilled Seabass- Êflavored perfectly with garlic, ginger and soy. ÊBut then i don't know if anyone can mess up making Seabass. ÊThis is my favorite fish of all time! ÊThis dish comes with a side of garlic-ginger noodles and string beans. ÊThe noodles are good but nowhere near Crustacean's garlic noodles, it's just flavored differently. ÊThe fried salmon roll is also quite tasty= it's crispy and pairs well the hot mustard. ÊI also had a bite of my friend's Wasabi noodles and Angus Steak and i thought that was declicious as well. Ê Overall, i wished The House wasn't so far away in SF. ÊIt's a great place for a date, but they will accomadate small parties. ÊIt's not a big restarurant so make sure you call ahead of time if you're in the area.

I didn't expect much coming into this place and was really just looking for any place to sit down and eat a lunch. To my surprise, the food was not that bad!

Good food, good ambiance, intimate, cozy, perfect! A new favorite place of mine! (and I thought all the hyped up Yelp reviews would ruin my experience for me but it didn't! It lived up to its 5 stars!) The food was yummy! We had the Ahi Tuna Tartare with Roasted Nori Chips, and Roasted Unagi with Avocado Sushi Rice for appetizers. Both were delicious!! The Ahi Tuna Tartare had an abundant amount of tuna, and the perfect amount of wasabi embedded into the tuna mix to provide a good kick! And the eel, let me start off by saying I am not a fan of unagi, tho I will eat it occasionally. And the roasted eel here was muy delicioso! It was nicely roasted and without the fishy taste. I would order both of these appetizers again! And for our main course, we ordered the Pomegranate Pork Chop, and it was good... but somehow, we expected better. Probably cuz all the Yelp reviews raved about this dish so much that we found it was a little less than stellar. But judging from how we cleaned up all the dishes... yes, every little piece of pomegranate I had left ended up nicely in my tummy, maybe this dish was pretty darn good! haha And the presentation of all the dishes we had were wonderful as well! This place has successfully managed to become a place I will revisit again! A lot of times I go into restaurants that have good food but the fancy environment makes it a bit stuffy or pretentious, so I don't usually return, unless the food was so excellent that I just had to (which is rare). Or some place that has good food but the ambiance is definitely too casual or lacking. But this place immediately puts me at ease and hits the spot! It is small, dim, intimate, and just the right ambiance between chic and casual. And I honestly think we had the best seats in the house (pun not intended)! We had the window seats which provided a nice view of people walking around the streets, The Stinking Rose right across from us, and the gelato place just down the street. This is exactly the type of atmosphere I'd envision eating in SF to be. There was a slight draft from sitting where we were since it's so close to the door, but it's nothing a glass of red wine can't take care of. And the servers weren't as friendly as they could be, but efficient and pleasant enough all around. Everything about this place is great, and I can't wait to go back there again!

Passed by this gem a few times before and never stopped to see what it was about. I needed a recommendation for dinner. Got a lot of varied suggestions from local friends, but one that almost everyone threw into the mix was The House. Took the advice of getting a reservation from fellow YELPERS and that paid off big time! We walked right in and sat down, while the crowd at the door mingled and struggled to find room to stand. i.e; a couple that walked in with us that didn't have reservations was sat around the time we had our after dinner coffee... The service was pretty matter of fact and on the rushed side. I get that it's busy and there is a bunch of people waiting to eat.... but a little smile wouldn't hurt either. Our server was to the point and efficient, no muss no fuss. The place is crowded and it's loud as other reviews mention. Ê We had a Lobster appetizer special, which it was very good. It was battered and fried sweet lobster tail meat with greens. We also had the green bean tempura appetizer, with what seemed to be a reduced ginger soy.. The sauce was very sweet, and only when I found some chilies in bottom of the sauce did the flavors really pop. I would have added minced chilies to the sauce or batter, was just too sweet and too one-dimensional. ÊMy wife had the Albacore special, it was cooked perfectly. The Crab roll that came with the albacore needed a sauce, it was bland, and it took a while to find one on the plate that seemed to be paired for that.... ÊThe sauces for it and the accompaniments were muddled, if you managed to find the right one it worked, but for a dinner in this setting, guessing isn't that much fun. I ordered the much talked about Sea Bass, and it lived up to it's billing. I did not use the sauce but a few times, it was again sweet. The bass was done so perfectly, it needed nothing else. I will add the noodle accompaniment set me off though. It was sweet and one dimensional. I just felt like it needed a tweak and it would get my 5. I will be back with the right expectation.

Been here a few times over the past five years, and re-visited it on monday night for bf's bday. We opted to have all small plates and share. We had hamachi sashimi appetizer, seared scallops (wow), shrimp dumplings (perfect, but probably can get an equivalent palette by going to dim sum), broiled oysters (the execution, we agreed, was the best we had ever had, although the bbq sauce was a bit to sweet for me), and crab cake (not cakes, it's a huge one). The service was pretty good, but waitstaff was a bit confused as each plate came out one at a time, and they kept clearing our plates and silver as if we were finished, or else ready for main course? Otherwise, everything was great!

In a word, excellent! Popped in here for a late lunch and so glad we did. The bean tempura was delightful, the curry noodles wonderfully tasty without feeling heavy or too creamy. The wasabi noodles were delicious with just the right amount of spice. Very reasonable price too (this was the lunch menu though). Highly recommend. I'll be heading back next time I'm in SF, guaranteed.

An Asian fusion restaurant recommended to me by a non-Asian friend. A situation that had disaster written ALL OVER it, but I was pleased to proven somewhat narrow minded and very wrong. Because I've eaten here three times now and it's all been really good. Nothing compares with my first lunch experience. If I were writing this review solely off my first review, this place would for sure have 5 stars from me. I had the spicy miso udon with crispy chicken (one of the specials for that day) and I've been dreaming about it ever since. Don't be confused by the Udon on the lunch menu, basically the same with a shoyu broth that does not even come close to comparing with the spicy miso. It was a thick and creamy soup dotted with red-orange drops of chili oil and speckled with sesame seeds and it is one of the best noodles soups I've ever had. However, the noodles were not udon and I know different areas of Japan have specialized versions of udon, but this was no udon I've ever seen before. I would characterize them as the ramen noodles used in the Hakata region, so same ingredients but more resilient and not curly. I will write odes pertaining to this noodle dish, I love soups/broths/stews and this one is high on my list of loves. The chicken was good too, surprisingly came on the side, but that's how it remains so perfectly juicy and crisp. It's hard to talk about the dishes I've had seeing as I usually order from the daily specials, it's rare when I eat things off the menu here. I tried my brother's Tuna BLT with wasabi mayo, meh. Boring in comparison with the spicy miso I was eating at the time. We also tried the shrimp and chive dumplings, way too small, but very tasty. And we tried the Caesar salad with crispy scallops which I liked a lot. The scallops couldve been crispier, but they were still nicely crisp, the salad was well-dressed, I would've eaten this as a lunch course for sure. MAKE RESERVATIONS FOR DINNER!!! 2nd time I came here, my friend and I weren't smart enough to have made reservations and ended up waiting here for well over an hour, and the hostess was non too friendly about the non-reservations peeps. We started with Blue lake bean tempura with pickled ginger soy (not my choice) it was good... I mean it's deep fried green beans, it's hard to go wrong, unless you over batter. We also shared a deep fried soft shell crab that was so beautifully put together I had to take a pic of it. After which my friend made fun of me nonstop for doing. It was a work of art dammit! We both had a fish course (boths daily specials), I had a decidedly american styled halibut (cream sauce with mashed potatoes), he had a asian styled skate. His was better than mine, but they were both really good, well cooked, with fantastic accoutrements. 3rd time - made reservations even tho it was lunch on a Tuesday, and thank goodness we did, cause it was packed! I made a mistake of thinking the Udon on the lunch menu was the same udon I had had the first time. It was good, but much lighter than the miso, a simpler but savory shoyu broth, with the perfectly cooked, crispy and juicy chicken. My first experience was 5 stars, my next two experiences were both 3 stars, so I guess I can round this off to an overall 3.5 star experience.

Soooo good. Also, I like that there's no ambiance; it keeps the emphasis on the food, which is spectacular, and also the throngs of tourists usually invading NB don't even notice it. I usually forgo their signature Sea Bass with sweet miso sauce, which is great, however I'm just not a fan of sea bass period. Their Ahi Tuna is the best in town, served two ways on one plate, lightly seared and toro sashimi.

This place satisfied my recent craving for seafood! ÊThe fish was fresh, and the portions were big. The unagi on rice and the deep fried salmon rolls were delicious appetizers.

This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I was introduced to this place as a tip to take a first date, that was many years ago. I still go there today and take friends. This place is good because the food is awesome, price is just right. The casual atmosphere makes your outing comfortable and fun. There's good energy in this place, which brings yours up as well. The food makes nice conversation pieces too, the presentation makes you want to reach over to their plate and grab a bite. I usually get the pork chop w/ pomegranate sauce. Can't wait to head over there again, hopefully soon.

Wonderful place, my partner and I were taken there on Saturday night by some mutual friends. Small, intimate, can hear each other talking. There was a line, which i heard was routine, but we did have reservations, and was seated on time. Our wait staff was wonderful, playful, and kept us happy. The food was amazing. The black bean tempura was out of this world, as was my main course, the wasabi noodle flat iron steak. Dee licious! The deserts were amazing, the chocolate torte was sooooo good. This is a must and a nice break from the traditional italian food in North Beach!

Always Wanted to and Did This Weekend! I've always wanted to eat at this place when it was at the Sunset, but finally got the opportunity and everything went well. ÊMy friends and I had a great time here and everyone loved the food. I had the Sea Bass which was tender and nice texture taste. ÊMy friend had the special Moon fish, which they enjoyed also. ÊA nice white wine goes well with it which we had. ÊThe service was good, but a little hetic which made the servers very busy. ÊWe had this nice truffle cake which everyone in my party enjoyed as well. ÊI thought the price was a little pricey, but normal for fine cusine. I definitely recommend this place. My friends said they all come back again and complemented me on chosing this place. I hope this will help you decide.

I worked in North Beach for three years and this is definitely one of its best restaurants. The grilled sea bass is fantastic. But you can't go wrong with the wasabi noodles in flatiron steak either. When you do go order the deep-fried salmon roll appetizer and consider trying the lychee black tea.

My first visit to this place was over the summer while visiting a relative. ÊThis was apparently their place to take friends and such and I can totally see why. ÊThe ambiance of the place was wonderful. ÊNoisy enough to be considered cheerful without having to shout across the table to be heard. ÊWe had the wasabi tempura green beans and that was wonderfully light. ÊFor entrees, I would suggest going for their fish. ÊAnything fish. ÊThe sea bass was the most tender and flavorful fish dish I've had in a long time. Ê My only complaint for the place is that space is pretty tight, sometimes it seems like you are sharing a meal with the neighbors, but that can be fun, we chatted up our neighbors while we both waited for our meals. Ê This is definitely somewhere I'd go straight to again next time I'm in San Fran and would not hesitate to recommend it to others.

kqed's 'check please' featured house in a recent episode that aired earlier tonight. watching the diners share about their experience prompted me to yelp! i have been a long time patron -- since they opened their doors and had two locations. over the years i've visited other restaurants featuring asian cuisine , and the house remains in my top three favorite places to eat. each time i've visited, we've been warmly greeted. angela and larry are usually there, many times with their kids. the food is consistently wonderful, delicious and satisfying. the service is great although you will need to make reservations -- they are always busy. i've tried most of the dishes on their menu and enjoyed each one. if you're visiting for the first time, i'd suggest the sea bass. Êalso consider the sesame soy glazed salmon in a bonito sake broth. my husband loved it Ê=) my one gripe is that they are located in north beach where parking is a challenge but it's worth the trek.

holy smokes. best restaurant i have ever been to in the yay-area(food-wise). Êspent $100 for two people: appetizer, 2 entree, half bottle of wine. Êentrees are 18-26 and appetizers are 8-10. Êso its possible to eat here for much less. service is average to mediocre which gives it -1 star, but the food is soo good it would be worth a 6+ so averages out to 5* rating. sea bass was the bomb, grilled calamari (was the special for the day, not sure how long their rotations are) is amazing, and the pork chops were great, (but would reccomend the sea bass before the chops). its a small place (total seating capacity couldnt be much more than 25), and the wait can be long, they were quoting 1.5 hours at 7:30 (we had reservation). Êtry to plan accordingly. Êgo here....seriously, just go.

I wanted to love this place so dearly bad - as many of my friends have had glowing reviews, but this is what I will say ... this place is for someone who does not know how to cook Asian food that well. If you can cook Asian, you may be somewhat disappointed as the food does not come off any more unique than something you could stir fry or grill at home. However, if you can't make this at home - it's a great deal - sizeable portions, friendly atmosphere, not the best of service but not the worst, tasty seafood. My favorites were the Chilean Sea Bass and the special Hawaiian fish - big eye tuna sashimi and a grilled fish. My friend also ordered the wasabi noodles with a flat iron steak, but it wasn't that special and I could barely taste the wasabi. Oh and the Salmon rolls and salad with pork belly were delicious. So unfortunately I can cook Asian food so this was a bit of a bummer for me. The wine was way overpriced and very untasty with my meal. I think this place could be a great place - but serves to please a different crowd.

Probably the least friendly service I've experienced at a restaurant in SF. Server brushed past when we asked for a table for four, hearing but ignoring us. A few minutes later she seated us right next to the door. "Could we have one of the [many empty] tables in the back?", asked my shivering grandmother. "We have a lot of reservations tonight" was the cold response. ÊDisconcerting service was balanced by the excellent food with delish sauces and large portions. Highlight was the salmon rolls, but everything was very good, except for the blah desserts (head up the street for gelato instead). I thought service with a smile was easier to deliver than high quality cooking. I guess not a The House.

i'm giving this place 4 stars because while i had an awesome experience here, i'm honestly not sure if it was because i was buzzed from the awesomely good riesling we got or if it was because the food was actually that good. Ê 1. the scallops. (special) i think it was 1 or 2 gigantic scallops covered with microgreens. Êwe all really liked it. Ê 2. the salmon roll thingee. i thought it was delicious. 3. sea bass + noodles. Êmy sea bass was soft and tender. the noodles were fine - i actually really don't like those kind of thick noodles, but the wine made it tasty. Êminus the wine, this dish would have been good, but not that special. 4. desserts. good. mango tapioca and a cake of some sort. the prices are pretty reasonable. i'd come here again. the service was good. efficient, friendly enough but not ass kissing friendly. Ê parking is really bad, so i'll just tell you to save yourself the 45 minutes driving around trying to maneuver 1 way streets after which you still won't find parking. there's a parking garage nearby. Êjust pay to park there. Êit's well worth it.

As a regular at The House, I brought a total newcomer this evening, and he agreed with this rating. ÊAlthough he had to have the sea bass for which they are famous, I insisted on having specials, items which I had never before tried, just to see how they do with Êvariations. ÊOnce again, I was totally delighted. ÊThe hamachi carpaccio was unbelievable - the freshest possible fish with a "salsa" of avocado, shallots, and I have no idea what else. ÊI followed this with their special of halibut, created with a curry sauce and a sprinkling of the finest shreds of lightly fried sweet potato. ÊOutstanding. ÊIn addition, the wine list is excellent, and (for a restaurant) decently priced. ÊI will continue to think of The House as my home away from home for great evenings out. ÊMy guest and I wanted plenty of time to talk - 3 hours, in fact! ÊAnd we never felt rushed by anyone in the restaurant. ÊBravo to The House for staying consistently great year after year.

Came here for my friends brays dinner on a Friday in march. It's a real petite place, only fits what looked to be less than 100 people total and there wasn't much elbow room. Don't be scared after your first look at the menu: the food is a little pricey but the portions are quite generous. I got the salmon--a unique and tasty dish, but the pork chops with the currant sauce was BOMB. Good place for a date or intimate group of folks.

Thank god we made reservations because the place was packed! I had the mussels, sea bass and caesar salad with scallops.

Went to lunch with four other friends. I had high expectations because of the excellent reviews, and came out of the restaurant half happy. While some dishes were good, some were below my expectations. The popular dishes such as the fried salmon roll and sea bass were good. The house noodles were OK -- a little soggy and salty for my taste. We ordered one of the specials of the day, the soft shell crab, was excellent, but the noodles that came with it was wierd. So I think the place has perfected their "tried and true" dishes, the newer ones are short of their standard and will need some refinement. If I could I would give the place 3.5 stars, but I am giving 4 because it is hard to find a place that is innovative while price wise making it accessible to many people. The most expensive dish at lunch is $20 (sea bass) and the portions are huge.

It's rare that I find a restaurant in SF that I like enough to keep returning to. ÊI don't eat out all that much, so I generally like to try new places...unless I've discovered somewhere exceptional, and that's how I feel about The House! I've now eaten at The House enough times to have tried a large sampling of the options on the menu - and I have yet to get a dud. It's been consistently good. Actually, consistently amazing. For the appetizers, I love the ahi tuna tartare with nori chips (however I think I actually like the grilled ahi tuna entree more and getting both during the same meal would be tuna overkill), the calamari and the blue lake bean tempura. Really interesting presentation on both the tuna tartare (check out their website) and the tempura (it's assembled like a log cabin)! Entrees wise, as mentioned I think the tuna tartare is A-rate. I also love the steak (don't you dare get it cooked any more than medium; I heard someone next to me order it "well" the other night and I wanted to climb over and smack him) and wasabi noodles as well as grilled sea bass and also the pork chop. Heck, it's all good! Price wise I think for the amount (portions are pretty large) and quality of the good it's very reasonable. Entrees all run $17-$25. The restaurant is pretty small, and twice I have gotten stuck at the table by the front door which is pretty drafty/crawling with people waiting to be seated - it's better to sit in the middle/back (but not too close to the restrooms) of the restaurant. While the wait is pretty long if you don't make a reservation, I was able to walk in on a Saturday night, put in my name, hang out at City Lights for 45 minutes, come back and get seated in about 5 more. Not too bad. But life probably would be easier with a reservation. The House seems to do a booming business - so the food does come pretty quickly and I get the sense that they definitely want to move you out since the place is so damn small - but I have never felt uncomfortably rushed. Not great for larger parties since it's so small, but I have been to a birthday dinner with 8 and it managed to work out. Also worth mentioning that I kind of hate North Beach, but I would gladly venture there any time for a meal at The House. A must try for everyone!

We found this restaurant through Zegat and it was rated 27 along with Bulevard and Gary Danko. We love different food, upscale or casual Êand were hoping for some interesting flavors but our disappointment turned into frustration after we realized we walked and spent our $100 for 2 people in a tourist trap. Food was mediocre, space was small, uncomfortable and overcrowded, service was horrible. I am just wondering how much did they pay for Zegat's rating and who is giving them good reviews. I would avoid Êthis place again. SF is full of great Asian restaurants, but this one is not among them.

The House is a local wonder and is too often ignored by the fooderatzi of San Francisco, despite its excellent food and professional service. Representing Asian fusion with first rate ingredients, the sea bass is a must, as is the Hawaian butter fish when available. Wasabi noodles with pork or salmon never disappoint. The House is also open for lunch 6 days a week and the Asian chicken salad is excellent and very affordable light meal. Go and you will not be dissappointed.

Fusion so good the Sun would be jealous. ÊLarry Tse creates magic at this house. It is so unassuming that, while being right smack dab in the middle of North beach, we have ignorantly Êwalked or driven past it on prior occasions. May be that's a good thing, reservations might be even tougher Êif it announced itself like the other flashy mediocre italian places and strip clubs that abound North Beach. Once you are in, the tables are closely packed with diners glancing over at other tables. Mostly in envy to catch glimpses of the magnificently plated dishes. It doesn't help that it is hard to chose from a menu where everything looks like its worth ordering. You almost wish you had dietary restrictions to make the choice easier. Everything we tried here was fabulous. The Sea Bass, if at all possible, Ê is better than the hype. The soft shell crab tempura special... divine. The flat iron steak with wasabi noodles ... excellent. The scallops appetizer ....also excellent. The service is spot on. The prices are a steal for the quality and portions. The House most certainly deserves all the great reviews and accolades. The unpretentious but excellent food with great service in a simple yet elegant decor is Êworth every penny. To selfishly preserve future reservations for me- This review will self destruct in 5 seconds and your memory of it will be wiped for your own safety.

I'm not sure what the fuss is about. ÊOrdered the crab cake, unagi roll, shrimp dumplings, and the domestic Kobe steak. ÊCrab cake presentation was great, but inside it was kind of mushy. ÊUnagi roll had these flaky dried onions on the outside that made it look like it had been rolled in hay (yes, hay for horses). ÊThe shrimp dumplings were like ha gow at dim sum places, but at twice the price. ÊThe steak had A LOT of gristle. ÊI was spitting it out into my napkin every other bite. ÊMaybe they were having an off day, but I won't go back.

This place is great! Been there several times and the food is always consistently good and the service is equally good. The pork chops are awesome...and typically hard to get in a restaurant without getting dried out. Down it with a Chimay beer...good times!! Tried to get a 5:30 reservation and was SOL! Nothing until 9PM. Call in early...

I'm way overdue to write a review. Why do I like The House so much? Because they were the first to put me, and my stuck up A.Z.N ass, in place. ÊI was never a believer in asian fusion and steered clear of anything that would remotely indicate dredging X into tempura batter with a side of soy sauce. The House proved to me that the asian doesn't need to be in your face to be fusion. ÊIt's been two years and I can still remember the pork chop in currant sauce (Is that still even on the menu?) ÊIf it is, I still refer to it as one of my favorite pork chops in the city.

Food is definitely very good especially the seabass which is cooked perfectly and melts in your mouth goodness Five star for food. ÊSErvice as well is vry good. ÊThe place is small and cozy Ê(and I spied "Prisoner" in the bar....my very favorite wine); but the tables are so small so it limits you from ordering more. ÊI like ordering "family style" so I can try more and share the dishes with whoever I'm with, the last time we were there, it was a good thing that the table next to us was empty, otherwise, we would be having the dishes on our lap.

Hands down. THE BEST RESTAURANT in SF - no doubt. You know the Asian food is good when more than half the people in the place are also Asian (its true). Everything on the menu and all the specials are always the most delicious thing i've ever put in my mouth - and I usually hate how cliche Asian fusion is! Top notch service, wine, and fresh tasty food.

Now for dinner... we had one pomegranate porkchop, one steak, two cods with what i say are california rolls, and two of the shrimp risottos... every single dish was cleaned completely. Dessert was also delicious... ordered the mango tapioca, coconut creme brulee, and the apple pie. I cant wait to go here again... it a must if you are in the area.

I really like this place. The menu was great and the service was good. I had salmon roll as an appetizer and they were scrumptious! For my entree I had the Sea Bass. Lets start with the sides first. The noodles were really good. It had a great after taste to them. ÊThe asparagus...well they were perfect! It was like the noodles juices just flowed on over to the green veggies whitch made me just want to eat them fast. OK the sea bass was really good. It had a dip that was a little too salty, I just slightly dipped into it and it was enough to have the whole piece taste good. It may be a small place but that's what makes it a special place.Oh make sure to call before showing up! I strongly suggest you make reservations.

My girlfriend and I were looking to try something new for dinner tonight, so i quickly looked up some of the top rated asian restaurants in the city and The House popped up. I made a reservation for 7:30, and i ended up getting there about 15 minutes early. The first thing i noticed when walking in was how tiny the place was. It was crowded, and it felt very cramped and claustrophobic. They also didn't really have a waiting area or chairs to sit in while you wait. You kinda just stand there and stare at people while they eat their food. Awkward. The server was nice, but she seemed very busy. I also got seated in a wobbly chair (one of my pet peeves) but it being such a busy night, i didn't really have the option of switching tables. The menu is short and sweet. They have a good selection of appetizers, entree`s, and specials. Their list of wines, teas, and other beverages were also pretty extensive. We ended up ordering the fried calamari for our appetizer, and my girlfriend got the Halibut(one of the night's specials) while i ordered the sea bass. The food came promptly, but i was severely disappointed in the calamari. I'm not even exaggerating when i say that the calamari was close to burnt. I felt like i made the wrong decision with the appetizer, but then again, a restaurant that charges the prices that this place does should make sure every single item on the menu, even the ones that aren't the most popular, are at least up to par. This calamari was not. My entree, however, was very good. (4/5 stars) and i felt that it was perfectly cooked. The bass was tender, juicy, and had great flavor. I love the string beans that it came with, although the noodles that came with the dish was a little on the salty side. My girlfriend's Halibut tasted good, but she said it tasted a tad on the burnt side. Overall, especially with the horrible appetizer we were served, i don't think the food was worth the $63 (before tip) that we ended up spending. The space is crowded, small, and very noisy. I probably will not end up coming here especially with the endless selection of restaurants we have at our disposal here in the city.

Had no idea what I was headed to for dinner... a good friend had made the reservation and I was just showing up. Nestled in the heart of North Beach, and maintaining a not very interesting interior I was instantly wondering..."what is this place" and "why am I here"? I very quickly understood. After our waiter, a sweet helpful guy, came to list out the specials...all EIGHT of them...(i had to wonder if the owner a sadist!?)...we settled on our order, Calamari, scallop caesar, sole with noodles, and skirt steak...Everything was so TASTEY! Special Note: The two girls I was dining with had said the noodles were awesome...and they were right..specifically the flavor of the noodles on the sole, garlic excellence! If you like the Italian cat calls of North Beach waiters but are tired of their kitchens, try this special Asain gem, The House.

Loved it! ÊOkay, maybe it was the 2 bottles of wine we had with appetizers and dinner, but everything was delicious. ÊWe split 3 apps, 3 main dishes, and 3 desserts. The only thing that I found mediocre was the pumpkin pie. Ê The unagi appetizer, sea bass, and fried salmon rolls were as good as everyone else says. ÊWe also had a hamachi sashimi special for an appetizer (simply amazing) and the butterfish entree special ---which I personally was even happier with than their famous sea bass. ÊLast but not least, the pork butt (yes, it really is called that). Ê It is as tender and juicy as any butt should be. ÊYou didn't even need a knife to cut it, and it has a little slice of fois gras on top to make it even better. The creme brulee was fabulous as well. ÊThe chocolate cake was good too, but I still think the creme brulee was better. The coffee ice cream on top of the chocolate cake was good, but again --- it is just your standard coffee ice cream. ÊAs stated before, the pumpkin pie was nothing special. Ê ÊIt wasn't really my selection, and the person who ordered it thought it was good. ÊI guess it just depends on what you are craving to some degree. Overall, I am a fan of nouveau asian, so I am biased towards this type of food. ÊEven so, I still think it was a great experience and will come back. ÊThe only problem is getting there. ÊIt is in North Beach, so no parking for miles around. Take a cab.

i think if i'm ever going to give anything 5 stars, it's gotta be the house.

Êalthough everything was fried (and hey...it's pretty hard to go wrong with fried), the dishes were light and crispy. Êi also appreciated the sauces that accompanied the plate. Êthe wasabi sauce with the salmon roll was especially tasty. for the entree i shared the curry noodles with chicken, and sea bass. Êi was extremely pleased with the portions (and lunch is very reasonably priced!). Êthe sea bass was cooked perfectly, accompanied by fresh green beans and wasabi noodles. ÊThe sea bass also came with a sauce (i sense a theme here). Êthe entire dish was delicious! Êthe curry noodles were also tasty. Êthe sauce was not too thick nor too runny. Êi think it was a thai style curry with coconut milk. didn't get a chance to try any desserts because we had dessert waiting at "our house" :) but i'm sure i would have been impressed. presentation was amazing and the food was delicious!

OK...I was quite skeptical of asian fusion prior to coming here, however I needed something a bit different that my normal haunts as I was taking someone here on a date. I had to wait 15-20 minutes past my reservations time, but I thought it was totally worth it. Pros - Great service - Creative dishes - Fish and meat cooked perfectly - Decent portions Cons - TIny spot.

Delicious food. Totally Asian fusion . The mixture of flavor is great. All the flavors presented are strong tasting. The ribeye steak is flavorful and tender. Seemed to be marinated in a teriyaki or yoshidas type sauce, then smothered with garlic bits and then grilled and topped with some tiny greens. The Chilean Sea Bass was exquisite. Tender, moist, grilled to perfection with a soy dipping sauce. A good portion was given. I also tasted a bit of the pork chops too. It was very tender and juicy and covered in a pomegranite type sauce. Also a good portion. The presentations of food are fantastic. The deep fried soft shell crab appetizer was a pleasure to the eyes. The desserts ARE to die for. The Coconut creme bržlŽe was fantastc. Rather than a tiny dish, there was a good sized portion. The mango pudding was enjoyed by my sisters in law, which was raved about. The triple chocolate truffle cake was the best thing my daughter's ever eaten (according to her anyhow). The restaurant is small and reservations are highly recommended. Dishes are priced a little on the high side, but totally worth it. Parking is always tight in that area (upper Grant Ave.) . Arrive early, park, walk around the shopping area and do the best you can. After dinner a stroll to Coit Tower is recommended. The service is excellent. Our water glasses were constantly filled without asking. The servers were speedy, efficient, polite, and cheerful. Although the restaurant is small, there were plently of servers. All in all, I can't wait to go back there.

I wrote a review 9 months ago and said this place was the best --and it was. But, apparently, this is no longer the case and, over time, this place has gone downhill. My fish main course, while perfectly cooked, was salty beyond belief --in fact inedible. The same was true for the scallop appetizer. And, of course, the place is far too noisy; you almost have to scream to be heard across the table. Sorry, guys, but you need to pick it up in the kitchen. Over-salted and inedible fish are not good enough for SF.

We went here on a recommendation from a coworker who used to live in the area. We mainly had appetizers and split one of the specials between five people. We started with the ahi tuna (very nice, spicy flavor), white shrimp and chive dumpling (i was craving these today back in texas...they must have been good or had something that made them addicting), roasted unagi (really yummy and the rice had nice flavor not your standard white rice) and finally the crab cake (while it was a nice pear shape and large for a crab cake it was the worst thing we had). The special was a halibut and mussels in a coconut curry sauce. It was tasty! The house has a decent wine list and fair prices. I'll go back when I'm in town next time.

ÊThe waitress seemed a little tired and out of it and wasn't great at providing suggestions, but it was 9:30pm and I'm sure she was ready to go home. For our main dishes we ordered a flatiron steak and a albacore tuna with rice/seaweed roll. ÊAgain, the steak stood out above the tuna. ÊOverall, it was a B+ meal, but after reading through all the reviews, I was expecting a little more than that. ÊThe prices are consistent with that level of food. Ê Parking in this neighborhood is always a chore, but we knew that and found paid parking easily. ÊIt's fun to get there a little early and walk around to enjoy the bustle.

Êportions are generous. Êgreat lunch with good wine.

Looking for delicious, fresh and reasonably priced food in North Beach that's not Italian? ÊThen House is the place for you. ÊThis spot is exactly what a neighborhood restaurant should be- changing menu, friendly service, and well- small and a bit loud at times. ÊThe seafood is always perfectly prepared and they have a decent wine list. ÊDefinitely make a reservation regardless of the night you're visiting, unless you want to eat before 6 pm.

I frickin love this place. There are already eighty zillion reviews, so this doesn't really add much but the salmon roll appetizer is one of the top four dishes in the city. Seriously. I eat here on business all the time and insist on splitting it every time.

This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. ÊIt's small, and I suppose there are lots of places with better "ambience." ÊBut the food is fantastic. ÊI've never had a bad meal here.

Of all the very few restaurants I've been to in SF, this is by far my favorite. ÊI have however been to many restaurants elsewhere and The House still rivals for my favorite overall. ÊA 5 every time, everything on the menu, service too. ÊThe only thing I could ask for in a restaurant otherwise is a less tight, busy environment. ÊThe House is small, tight, crowded and always busy.

Ê ÊAll the other servers were also very attentive and friendly. AMBIENCE - this is a small space. ÊPerfect for groups of 2 or 4. ÊMore than that and it gets a bit tight. ÊThey do have one row of tables, if you have a larger (6+) party, you can reserve in advance and be fine. DRINKS - note that they only have beer and wine. ÊNo mixed drinks.

So what that management here handled a blushing bachelorette vomiting all over one of their tables with class and aplomb (read: looking hard away and then scrubbing quickly). They manage to seat people just as they're about to explode with hunger and impatience and then serve them food done quite right. The roasted unagi is laid atop rice that sets off its sweetness very well. The shrimp dumplings don't demand your attention, but are worth the short wait 'till they make it to your table. The main courses are well done. Seafood stars, but the meats can steal the show if your plate is graced with one of their fantastic sauces. The pomegranate currant, for example. Really though, what matters is the food made me forget that I had just seen a young girl about to be married vomit on herself. Sweet.

Brilliant food, service, and wine selection. The sea bass was recommended as a favourite, and was definitely a winner - exquisite taste and mix of subtle flavours. The pork chop was lavishly decorated and was tender and went perfectly with the pomegranate dressing. The deep fried salmon rolls were crisp and flavourful, and were perfectly complimented by the wasabi-infused sauce. Don't skimp on dessert - the chocolate cake with coffee ice cream was perhaps the best dessert I've had in San Francisco yet.

Oh, the House. ÊI would treat you much better if you were in my house. ÊI'm so completely utterly disappointed with the service here. ÊI walked in and was ignored for a bit by the hostess before she looked up and finally acknowledged me. ÊI was in a good mood, so I didn't hold it against her. ÊBut then comes dinner where the waitress seemed a bit more than annoyed by me. ÊSo much, in fact, that she decided to ignore our table during our meal, but made a point to check up on the table 2 inches away from us twice during their meal. ÊIf you're going to give me crappy service, don't rub it in my face by giving other tables stellar service. ÊAfter finally asking for our check and putting in our card, we sat...and sat...and sat waiting for our bill to come back. ÊIt was late at this point and there were probably 3 other tables in the place, so what's the hold up? ÊI watched as the table next to us received their bill and consistently better service from the same waitress. ÊWe finally asked someone for our card back so we could sign and be on our way, but she looked somewhat confused. ÊWe didn't even get half of an apology for being forgotten. ÊOh, and almost forgot to mention the wine my friend had, which left her with a mouthful of unfilter crud. ÊPlease decant your wine before serving. So onto the food: Sea bass with soba noodle and green beans - a tad bit too greasy (my lips had a nice oily sheen after I devoured the meal), but the flavors were on point. ÊBass melted in your mouth, probably the best bass I've ever had. ÊEverything on this plate was delicious. Mushroom and rice with shrimo: my friend loved hers, although I felt the shrimp were a bit overcooked and too salty, with too much of a charred smoky taste. ÊI didn't care too much for this dish. Tuna Tartare: Simply put, I've had better. ÊNothing really special. Crab cake: ÊWould've preferred more lumps of crab meat, it seemed overly mixed with mayo and other ingredients, so you can't really taste the crab meat. ÊFlavors were good, just not amazing. Salmon Rolls: effing amazing. ÊSalmon was buttery and delicious and cooked to perfection. ÊDidn't care too much for the salad it came on, but the rolls and dip made me very happy. Kobe beef salad with crisped rice and papaya: not too flavorful, and desperately needed some acidity to cut the meat and the ripe papaya. I wanted to like you, House, I really did, but I don't like paying good money and made to feel unwelcome.

Being not a very big fan of fusion food, this restaurant totally changed my perception. This is the best fusion restaurant in SF. We not only love the food, but the sauce in my opinion is what makes their food so special. I would suggest the fresh oysters and ribeye steak. The steak is cooked very tender and a fairly good portion for my big appetite. What I also like is that their food is consistently good, having been there at least 3 or 4 times. The atmosphere is very cozy, almost feels like dining at my own place. We have become the frequent goer to The House ever since.

2 Words ... Salmon Roll. This appetizer is not to be missed. I used to live down the street from The House and never got tired of eating here. One thing to keep coming back for is their wine list. It would seem that they never order enough of the wine to keep it on their list for more than a month or two. My guess is that the person who orders their wine has too much fun mixing things up and tasting all sorts of wine. Don't be too into your ego to ask for a recommendation. Even better is the fact that it's a very affordable list too!

After reading the reviews of The House restaurant I decided to give it a try. ÊMade a reservation for a Friday night and were promptly seated at the appointed time. The restaurant is relatively small and it was packed with customers. ÊThe decor has a modern asian feel. Ê The menu was mostly seafood. ÊOur party ordered the seared ahi tuna, wasabi noodles, and the grilled sea bass. ÊThe food was excellent. ÊI had the sea bass and I was able to try some of the seared ahi. ÊThe sea bass by itself had a great grilled flavor, but then I tried a bite dipped in the accompaning garlic ginger soy sauce. ÊFrom that point on I forgot about participating in the table conversation so I could focus all my attention on the meal in front of me. ÊI liked how the sauce was provided on the side. ÊIt was a bit salty (which I love) but it was nice to allow me to decide how much of it to use. ÊThe noodles and green beans that came with the dish was also excellent. ÊNothing was over or undercooked. ÊThe chef in the kitchen knew what he was doing. ÊI also tried the seared ahi and that too was excellent. ÊThe cut of the fish was top-notch and the sauce had a great wasabi kick to it. ÊI definitely recommend this restaurant.

Ah, The House. I had almost forgotten about you it has been so many years! But now that I'm back in the hood, I can wander up there for lunch all the time - yay! One of my co-workers and I walked toward North Beach searching for some lunch vittles. We were pretty aimless and as we started to cross Grant I recalled in my dim, aged memory having some pretty tasty lunches here once upon a time. So we walked right in (without reservations - whew!) and plopped ourselves down and were thrilled we did! Co-worker had the ahi tuna sandwich w/ wasabi. I believe his eye rolls, lip smacking and "mmmmm's" were fairly indicative of his general feelings about the food. I chose the grilled chicken with mushroom black bean sauce and I have to say there was a fair bit of lip smacking on my side of the table as well. The chicken was delicious (maybe just a few seconds too long on the grill, but yummy nonetheless) and it was paired with a tangy, slightly bitter bok choy (and maybe some mustard greens?) and a little asparagus which was the perfect foil to the artful pile of creamy mashed taters. And the mushroom black bean sauce was AWESOME. And for only 10 bucks??? I pay that for a medium so-so salad in the FiDi. Go. Go. Go. It may seem a little odd to find asian solidly in North Beach (oh wait, it's SF, that's not weird at all) and you will be so glad you did!

My wife and I have been going to this place at least once a month for years and years. ÊAngela and Larry have an incredible establishment with very reasonable prices. We frequent a number of restaurants in the San Francisco area and this is simply the best! For first timers the sea bass is to die for but I love their wasabi house noodles with grilled salmon. For starters you will never fail with their deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard wasabi dipping sauce BUT if you are able to try their soft shell crab, BBQ oysters, or scallops please do. ÊThe food is not only incredible but care is taken on the presentation. ÊAdditionally the service is inviting so to sum this up... I honestly believe this is one of the best secrets in the city!!!!

The first time I came here was with my parents. My parents said this place was good so they brought me here. We ordered the Deep-fried salmon roll. It was like a sushi like thing. It was pretty good. We also ordered the sea bass and the angus ribeye steak. They were both so good! Especially the sea bass it melts right in your mouth! It came with some stringed beans on the side. Like SERIOUSLY I think I fell in love with that sea bass! LOL. Highly recommend that sea bass. The second time I went there was for my 20th birthday with my girls. I made a reservation less than a week before but the only times that were available were at the opening time and around 10. So, I chose the opening time. It's too bad that we had to rush our time because they told us that we only had one hour to stay there. They had places reserved for other people. Anyways, I ordered the wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak. The noodles were only okay tasting but the steak was good. But it still felt like there was something missing in that dish. I think it was maybe because during opening time they didn't really prepare much. But all in all I still highly recommend this place. It's a small place. So it's not good for huge groups! It's good for a date or even a double date!

this is by far my favourite restaurant in the bay area. i lovelovelove this place! i love how they're v.down to eartn and v.focused on their creativity with true asian fusion dishes. one of my favourite dishes was a special that i only got to have once - braised kobe style short ribs v.lightly seared on the outside, served with asian greens. Êthe regular dishes i always get would be the unagi avocado rice (appetizer) and the mushroom rice with tiger prawns (kinda like an asian risotto made with shrimp broth, mushrooms, pinenuts). it's always really busy here, even on a sunday night, so make sure you call ahead of time to make reservations at this dainty restaurant. Êthe decor is v.plain with wooden chairs and tables and doesn't quite allow you to focus on anything but their good food. service is decent and the wine list is pretty good - they have great selections for reasonable prices.

I had read the good reviews about this place prior to going and was not disappointed. Delicious, beautifully presented food: I highly recommend the ahi tuna main course, and the specials all sounded amazing. I also really enjoyed the tapioca pudding and like the fact that they recommend a dessert wine to complement each item. The service left nothing to be desired and was everything it should be. My only gripe is that it is a little pricey - not so much the food, which is well worth it, but the wine.

UPDATE: i went here for lunch and it was fantastic!! i had the curry shrimp udon and loved every bite. the deep fried salmon roll appetizer was fabulous as well. my friends got the warm wasabi noodles w/ salmon (so good) and tuna BLT (i didn't try it). the portions are quite generous for lunch. delish! my first yelp review goes to the house restaurant. this place is soooo good! i love, love, love the food. wish the restaurant wasn't so small...we were packed in like sardines. but, that's ok, once you see and taste the food, all is forgiven. this is my favorite asian fusion restaurant. can't wait to go back!!

I've been to this place twice and both times have been very, very good! ÊThe food is excellent. ÊEach time I've ordered the specials and have not been disappointed. ÊThe atmosphere is lively, and the crowd hip. ÊThe seafood is fresh; the oysters were yummie that last time I've had them. ÊIt's a little gem in the heart of North Beach!

My best friend took me to here for dinner after she did a little research on yelp (of course!) for a place that served good sea bass & ahi tuna tartare. My absolute favorites in terms of seafood dishes! This place was busy on a Thursday night... maybe since this place is small & it was prime time for dinner. ÊWe had the ahi tuna tartare & salmon roll as appetizers and the grilled seabass to share.... Delicious! The tuna tartare and seabass both tasted fresh and was prepared just right... flaky and not overcooked. Ê The service, on the other hand, was mediocre... my friend arrived before me & told the guy she had reservations, but he could not find her reservation in the book. Ê(but she did receive a confirmation call the day before to confirm the reservations)... How can that be, if someone from their restaurant called to confirm... STRANGE! ÊLuckily, there were a couple of tables opened, so he sat her down. ÊDuring the dinner, we felt a bit rushed, as the waitress kept asking if we were done with our meal, even though we were clearly still eating... fork in hand Ê& picking at the food... and when we were finally done with our meal, she brought us the check without asking if we wanted to look at the dessert menu (I LOVE desserts.. so YES, I wanted to look at the dessert menu)... so when we got our dessert, she brought out the check again.... I understand other ppl were waiting to be seated (we were seated for about an hour & 10 minutes)... but let us enjoy the food.. GEEZ! (dock a star & a half for so-so service) I give this place a 3.5 - 4 stars... the food is awesome; service is ok, maybe better if you can eat a 3 course meal in 45 minutes or less! ÊAlso, make reservations & get the person's name if you can, just in case they can't find your reservations.

As I write this The House has 655 reviews and 4 1/2 stars. I'm adding in my 2 cents here and giving them 5. Amazingly mouth-watering food. Well balanced and cooked to perfection. A great blend of Asian fusion with (thankfully) a heavier emphasis on the Asian side. This has to be one of my favorite restaurants and if I didn't live in NYC, I would be a weekly fixture.

Came here for NYE dinner with a group of 8, not exactly the best place for a large group, but it was worth squeezing in to try the food. We shared a bunch of appetizers, I particularly liked the hamachi sashimi and also the fried salmon rolls. ÊI ordered the sea bass since everyone here recommended it, it was good but I've had better. The soysauce was really unecessary since the dish was already seasoned, and overall, the beans and noodles and fish were slightly greasy. ÊMy friend's black cod was delicious and the pork looked pretty good. However, the meyer lemon pot de creme was DELICOUS! The perfect end to a v. good meal. Service was alright, nothing special. I would definitely come back here again for the food!

Holy SARDINE CAN Batman!!! Our dinner experience here started off to a rocky start. The BF made reservations for 8:30 on a saturday night, we arrived at around 8:10. ÊThe hostess states that they do not have us listed at all, but there was a cancellation and we could be seated in 20 minutes. Sweet we'll still be seated at 8:30. Our server leads us to our seats and we squeeze around the other patrons and look at the menu. ÊIt turns out, the menu is not that descriptive, we just end up looking at other people's plates.

LOVE IT!!! We were recommended from our best friends about this place. Our resv. was early which was good because the place can get very crowded quickly. Tiny place but comfortable. THE FOOD WAS OFF THE HOOK! Oh damn....the deep fried salmon roll with hot chinese mustard appetizer. Whoa! savored every bite. Cooked perfectly. That was a good sample of the quality of what was to come. Our waitress..... very helpful and explained more of the chefs specials. Damn. how does she remember all that? Impressive. Had a hard time choosing but I definitely wanted to try the Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. The wife had the Sesame soy glazed himachi in a bonito sake broth. WOW! I had to eat slow just to enjoy all the flavor. Always save room for desert... and again very impressed with our waitress who selected a perfect wine to pair with the red velvet cake. Sigh!!! Left the place with a good wine buzz and complete satisfaction. Time to go clubbin' . We are definitely going back because the set menu had so many I want to try along with the daily chef specials that also sounded good.

Cramped into the tight and crowded streets of San Francisco's North Beach district, this modern Asian-Fusion restaurant is a must-try. Ordered an appetizer of Mussels ($8), and main entrees Sea Bass ($27), Kobe New York Steak ($34), and a Ommegang Trappist Beer ($8). The main entrees are generous portions and will definitely fill the average person. The Sea Bass was steamed then grilled and was extremely moist, perhaps one of the most moistly cooked fish I have ever tasted. The Kobe steak was a ribeye slab sliced in two, ordered medium, it was cooked correctly with alot of flavor maintained. The service is friendly, and will accomodate to specific seating requests, however make reservations because this place is packed on the weekends. For a place in San Francisco, the price is typical of a fancy restaurant however the portions make it a great place to get full for your money.

We were in town looking for some good seafood and we found the best sea bass we have ever had. It was perfectly prepared and tasted amazing melting in your mouth. Before having the sea bass we had the calamari and muscle appetizer. All of the food tasted excellent. Calling for a reservation is recommended but not required. The only complaint I had was they sat us right next to the door on a cold night when there was open tables. So I just put my jacket back on and enjoyed the great food. Next time we go to San Francisco this will definitely be a place we would go back to for excellent food. I would like to try some of the other dishes to see if they are just as good.

If you are looking for a great place for great food and creative dishes, this is your place. However, if you need to have mannerly and polite service to digest your food, this is not for you. My friend and I wanted to celebrate an important milestone and she drove almost 2 hours specifically to enjoy a luncheon at The House. We heard so much about this place so we were totally psyched to try it out. We ordered THREE entrees to share and also, a soup for each of us to start and thoroughly enjoyed all . We were about to order dessert and the original waitress (very nice) had left so what seemed to be the main receptionist Êtook over our section. This woman with a very dark foreboding look and hair that hung straight on her face over our plates was beyond rude and said that we had 20 seconds to order. We thought she was joking and Êmy friend proceeded to ask her what was good and she repeated that we now had less than 20 seconds to put in our order. Even if the kitchen or pastry chef was having a bad day, I don't think that a countdown was necessary to put on the patrons! The table next to us were tourists and were totally shocked ( we had been talking to them as they were also there for a special occasion) and needless to say, we all wanted to leave immediately. I have sympathy for the talented Chef and all the people in the kitchen that work so hard to create such incredible food but have the most horrible person out front. The greeters and servers are the most important in any establishment . They make people feel welcomed and happy! I am local and when I want to entertain my friends and family, The House is not where I'd ever want to chance again.

When most other reviews around this one grant this establishment 4 stars or above, it's easy to dimiss the lone three star or below review as some pessimistic asshole who wants to give a mediocre/bad review "just cause." ÊBut please allow me to explain myself before passing judgement! On occasion, I come to The House only for lunch. ÊAnd when I eat here, I only order one thing: the warm wasabi noodles. ÊWhy only lunch? ÊWhy only that entree? ÊThere's a couple reasons why I'd rather go to other places to eat for dinner. ÊFirst off, the service at The House isn't exactly up to par. ÊThe House presents itself as a fine dining restaurant, and as such their service needs to be at that level. ÊNow while I'm not expecting the same kind of service that I'd receive at Gary Danko's, I do expect personable service and more attention to detail than your regular walk-in diner. ÊAt The House, the service is a bit cold, and somewhat clumsy. ÊBy clumsy, I mean that the waiters often overlook the obvious such as filling up your glass for water, or forgetting basic requests. ÊThis is no fluke; I've been eating here for years and it's always the same service. ÊFor example, my uncle likes his wasabi noodles mild, but the waiters somehow always make it spicy. ÊOoops? ÊFor dinner, this would be somewhat unacceptable. ÊBut for lunch, I can deal with it. ÊThe restaurant is also EXTREMELY loud at dinner time. ÊI want to be able to hear my guest without having to struggle over the sounds of pots, pans, music that's too loud, etc. ÊPeople might say, "Oh, Craig, it's cause the room is so small," but I've been to other restaurants that are just as small but much less noisy. ÊIt's these kinds of details that really make or break a dining experience. As for why I only order the wasabi noodles, it's because I feel like it's the only real thing that they do well and that separates The House from the millions of other Asian fusion restaurants. ÊThey come out nice and warm with a little bit of bite; the perfect noon time lunch on a typical, cool, overcast San Francisco day. So in conclusion, come here for lunch when it's not so crowded, but don't expect a kick ass dining experience at night.

ÊThere was plenty of room, but it was packed by noon. ÊWe started with the famous salmon roll appetizer, and both the salmon and the dipping sauce were perfect. ÊI had one of their specials: Êpork butt with papadalle (sp?) noodles. ÊThe cubed pork pieces were seered perfectly and the noodles were cooked through with a marvelous sauce that reminded me of something my mother use to cook.

This place is the shiznitz. ÊGreat food and great service. ÊMy gf wanted to go here for her birthday and I'm glad I took her. ÊI ordered the pork with the pomegranate sauce and it was damn great. ÊWhen I took my first bite into the meat, gat dang!!! ÊThe meat was super juicy (maybe cuz it was cooked medium); it's probably one of their best dishes. ÊMy gf ordered the sea bass and it was really good also. ÊSome parts of it was a tiny bit salty but nothing to complain about. ÊFrom what I saw at other tables, all their food looks great with nice edible decor. Ê The place is small but I made reservations so it was no biggy. ÊThe atmosphere is very casual, it can get pretty loud though with all the customers talking. ÊIt's not Êa place you want to go if you want to have a nice quiet meal unless it's one of the odd hours where there isn't anyone there. Overall, for the price you pay, this place does not disappoint. ÊDefinitely will recommend this place to everyone I know.

Food was great, but damn the portions were small. ÊWe ordered the salmon roll, bass entree, salad, salmon entree, calamari, and noodle entree. ÊAll very well seasoned and delicious. ÊI have to say I was still hungry when I left. ÊVeggies with the entrees were cooked perfect and seasoned well. Service was kind of slow cause it was pretty packed.

This is my favorite lunch place. I am always more than willing to make the trek to this place from the lower financial district area. My usual order of Warm Wasabi noodles with Grilled Chicken is mouth watering (also served with Pork or Steak). There is also a creamy special soup with crispy chicken that is delectable! Getting in with no reservations M-F for 2-3 hasn't been a problem lately. The waiting staff is very friendly and have come to know me as a regular. Excellent food. Well priced.

Whenever someone asks me my favorite place in North Beach, I tell them that Ideale is my favorite Italian Restaurant and that The House is out of this world. There food is relatively inexpensive for its quality and presentation. The chef Larry is amazing at creating a fusion-like experience, but still maintaining many of the original elements of whatever asian dishes inspired him. If the Ahi is on the menu, you have to try it. I would write more, but it seems everyone else has head the nail on the head. People working are very kind and interesting, food is excellent, decor is somewhat charming. Never had a bad meal and I've been there far too many times to count.

PROS: really great food, prices are very fair, specials add good variety, food presentation is impressive, innovative dishes and the food quality is really excellent. CONS: even if you have a reservation, you will almost always still have to wait. they schedule the reservations too closely together so there is always a good chance that reservations will overlap, which sucks. they really squeeze you in, lets say you are a party of 5, be prepared to sit at a table for 4 with an added chair at the end, you will almost likely never get a table for 6 (all their tables are rectangular, no round tables). because if the tight spacing, it is also very noisy here. there is practically no waiting area, which again sucks because as mentioned before you are going to have to wait even if you have a reservation (from 10 minutes all the way to 30 minutes). dessert is the weak part of their menu, corkage is a bit expensive ($20) especially since they do not have a sommelier and their stemware is mediocre at best. OVERALL: Still i keep coming back, even if there a lot of tiny things that annoy me, the food is just really that good.

We usually go to the House once a month but hadn't been in awhile. Ê I still am amazed everytime I go at how awesome the sea bass dish is. ÊEverytime I vow to order something different in the spirit of trying something new but then I get the sea bass because I know I will just be thinking that I should have ordered it while I'm eating whatever else I ordered. ÊAll the food is always good but if I have an out of town guest I take them to the House and make them order the Sea Bass. Ê It's seriously one of the top dishes in SF.

This was a LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT/SMELL/TASTE for me Every occations, celebrations, and holidays my husband & I will make excuses to eat here. Yes it's a little pricey but it's worth it. I drive 45 minutes to eat here. I tried looking for a substitute in San Jose, I've been burned, so I stop looking. RESERVATION RESERVATION RESERVATION you will wait 2 hours for a table if you don't have a reservation. This place gets sooo packed that you might even wait 20 minutes even with reservation, but believe me it's worth the wait. My husband & I are not wine drinkers but they have a wide selection of wines & they pair it with the food. My husband always drink Tsingtao & I always have the Jasmine Hot Tea. We always start with the Tuna Tartare and occasionally I order half shell oyster for myself (careful with the side sauce, it can be very spicy). For our entree you can never go wrong with a fish dish but our favorite would have to be the Grilled Sea Bass or the Sesame Soy Glazed Salmon. Occasionally they have the black cod with the california roll on top DELISH...You can never go wrong with a fish dish. Husband tried the steak and wasn't impressed and the mash potato was disgusting (boxed mash taste better). But then again don't go to an Asian Fusian place and order American Food. For dessert my husband orders the Apple Pie Alamode and I always get the Mango Tapioca hmmmm mouth watering, I can eat a whole gallon of that good stuff. Their service is TOP NOTCH...you'll get your water & Korean pickle in less than 5 minutes. The wait staff is impecable. They memorize their specials and they tend to all your needs but not to a point where they are huvering. I hardly ever asked for drink refills cuz they are on it. Even though the table is small they make sure they take your empty plate immediately. I notice the wait staff informs the cook when you're close to finishing your dish, which I appreciate very much. I hate waiting! on a busy days(i mean hectic busy) you'll get your food in 10-15 minutes. I WISH THEY WOULD OPEN A SECOND LOCATION IN SAN JOSE. pleeeeaaasssseeee

I went here last year for my birthday. The restaurant itself is small, so i recommend making reservations or going early. It is right across the street from stinking rose, tucked into the alley, so parking is also a bit of a challenge, although there is a garage further up the street. if you can cab it, it may be worth your time and energy, esp. on a weekend when parking and traffic are horrendous (North beach, people!). The prices are reasonable, portions decent Êand the food is clean and flavorful. It is definitely a place I would go again for a nice private party or get together with friends. Try the pot stickers and some rolls if you ger a chance. my mother also loves the sea bass.

The House is a top-5 restaurant in SF. MUST get the Sea Bass and Black Cod (only available if on Specials menu). Both are amazingly tender and mouth-watering with sauces that have me licking the plate at the end. Also good: - Scallops - very tasty appetizer, but small portions Cons: - Limited seating, so recommend making reservations for parties anywhere from 2 to 8. - Parking: need to get lucky in North Beach. Can also park in a garage 3 blocks away on Vallejo/Stockton

We went here on Christmas Eve. Service was amazing. I drink a lot of water, and my cup was NEVER empty because someone promptly refilled it. I ordered the Seabass and requested Wasabi noodles instead of the normal side dishes (as recommended by past yelp diners). It was delicious and I would get it again. My dad said the pork chop was "among, if not the best" that he's ever had. My mom and her friend had the blackened fish. They both said it was amazing. Appetizers: We were with a group of people so we tried everything. I liked it all, but the deep-fried salmon roll and Tuna roll-like appetizer stick out in my mind. They were all quite good though.

Most of the time, Asian fusion restaurants end up as nothing but confusion -- neither here nor there, more a frightening Frankenstein of flavors. Not here. Since moving back to San Francisco after many years on the East Coast and overseas, The House is the only restaurant that has delivered so far. Unlike the other highly rated places that underwhelm or made me sick, The House made me say wow. Eating my way around the city and the peninsula, as well as Napa and Sonoma, in fancy places and hole in the wall joints, the sea bass at The House so far reigns over everything else. The House can cook fish. It's not overcooked nor undercooked. It hits the sweet spot.

GO early and put your name on the list, give them your cellphone number and they will call you when your table is ready. ÊThere is a nice bar one block up the street that has amazing and exotic beers to try while you wait for your table. Ordered: appetizer: Tempura soft shell crab with spicy somen -special Entree: miso salmon over baby bok choy (came with side of rice) Entree: Foie gras (duck liver) over pork roast (came with side of rice) -special Both entrees were enough to make us stuffed and cooked really well...not well done, but really perfect. ÊNever had duck liver before, but it was damn good with the pork and rice. If they have the soft shelle crab again, please get it. ÊOur dishes were similar to a japanese restaurant style. Ê Service is really polite. If you are down to spend about $70 for two people for a great meal, then please come to North Beach in SF and eat here.

This place has one good thing....the food. The dishes were amazingly good. Not one meal disappointed. The reason I gave it only three stars is because the service was only okay. It took them forever to greet us. The waitress seemed a little out of it. Felt like we were being waited on my a robot. Secondly, they charge way too much for corkage! They were going to charge us $40 dollars for our chamgagne. They also didn't tell us that only two credit cards per bill were allowed. This was somewhat difficult for us because we were a party of ten. If this is there practice then they should inform the person who makes the reservation when they are booking a table. Lastly, the place is too cramp. They practically seat you on top of other tables. While waiting for our table I watched them trap people into their seat by putting someone on the edge of a table thus blocking them from getting up. No one wants to dine uncomfortably. Even though the food is good, I won't be returning. That was an overall consensus from everyone in our group. The bad service and environment was enough to outweigh the food.

Party of 8, yes we squeezed into this small spot. I'm still surprised we were able to do a party of 8. I wasn't expecting too much from this place but it had GREAT reviews on yelp. I took others opinions and selections while deciding on my own meal. I wasn't too hungry since I just got back from the boiling crab a few hours prior. I decided to go into the SMALL section of the menu. I had the Unagi avacado with sushi rice - delicious.. the unagi had this perfect bbq flavor to it.. the sushi had some strong spots of wasabi which was a little intense for me. But overall it was delicious. I also had one of their Specials, bbq oysters. When I think of bbq oysters I think of smoked on the grill served with lemon, Tabasco, or garlic and butter. The house killed it by putting actual BBQ sauce over the oysters. I would suggest them put it on the side for taste. But nonetheless they were still good oysters. I had a taste test of all the other plates at the table. Mushroom rice with prawns was so good, wasabi noodles were good, fried salmon roll was good but beware of the chinese mustard sauce.. soo spicy! (also a good app to share because the salmon gets overwhelming) and the steak was tough and med. rare seemed more like rare. I really wish I could of tried the sea bass.. NEXT TIME... NEXT TIME..

My boyfriend chose to take me to the house for our anniversary dinner because of their crazy reviews. I have never even heard of this place, but by the raving reviews on yelp, i was dying to try their sea bass. When we arrived to the house, parking was hard but its san francisco, i should have already expected that. we parked a few blocks down in a lot that cost $15. When we stepped into the house, it was extremely tiny. The tables were so close to each other, it felt a little uncomfortable trying to have a romantic date with my man. We started off with glasses of wine to loosen up a bit, and it worked. We started dinner off with 2 appetizers; The deep fried salmon & oysters on the half shell. The deep fried salmon was no joke. it was so delicious! The wasabi sauce on the side had a little kick to it, which made the salmon more interesting. The oysters on the half shell were nothing special, but i still ate it all. =] For Entrees, I had the sea bass of course, and my man had the wasabi noodles with grilled flat iron steak on top. They were both extremely delicious. The sea bass was so soft and buttery, nobody on yelp was exaggerating about this stuff! The wasabi noodles were very delicious as well, almost reminded me of garlic noodles but a little more saltier. I high recommend anyone to try this place!! I also suggest you make reservations. My boyfriend and i were just going to show up, but i made him call in and good thing we did because we were able to get one of the last tables that night!

AWESOME, AWESOME service!!! this is probably one of the very few asian fusion places i will probably give a decent rating to ... it was a definite toss up btwn a 4.5 to a 5, but the overall experience, and more .. 5 stars it is.. the house isn't a place i'd DIE to come back, but a place i would recommend to others ... another local favorite i'd totally recommend to others is probably A16 (http://www.yelp.com/biz/É), which is in the marina ... Ê the service .. above and beyond ... we weren't the only ones there either ... friendly, upbeat, and extremely attentive ... for lunch hr it was quite busy ... and regardless, we were still able to score a table right next to the window, and watch the people pass on by ... the place is quite small, cozy, to say the very least, with wooden tables and covered with fine art prints on moss-colored walls. we ordered the following, and even though they HAVE this on the lunch menu, we opted for a dinner portion DURING lunch, because we were just too hungry ... we started off with the deep friend salmon roll w/hot mustard $8.50.. it was SOOO good .. you must be a salmon lover and the size was ginormous... Êhe then, went for the wasabi noodles w/angus steak (lunch $15/ dinner $17)... it wasn't all that but it had a great twist ... i liked my $20/24 grilled seabass w/garlic ginger soy ... my noodles that came out on the side was not only super tasty, but their seabass was cooked with perfection! super flaky, and super crispy!! YUM! you could totally tell that the ingredients were SO fresh, and heavenly! mmm ... the drinks were quite reasonably priced too.. worth another visit ...

On one of the windiest days in North Beach history, we huddled outside the front window staring at a warm, empty dining room and watched as employee after employee entered the restaurant and locked the door behind them. ÊIf we didn't have a can of grapefruit soda spiked with Belvedere to warm us up, we might have gotten pneumonia. Ê10 minutes passed, and we were already walking back to the car before our host had the good sense to open the doors a few minutes early and shelter us from the elements. ÊThe appetizers came surprisingly fast, and didn't seem to take much effort. ÊDon't order the chicken liver with mixed greens unless you want chicken liver with mixed greens, because that's exactly what you're going to get. ÊNo bells & whistles here. ÊNo dressing or seasoning either. ÊThe tempura green beans were good because green beans are good right now. ÊBut if it only costs them $1 to make, why are we paying $8? ÊThe miso-glazed butterfish was ok but mine is better. ÊOn the other hand, the wasabi house noodles with flatiron steak were an utter disappointment. ÊHorseradish and steak...it's gotta be good right? ÊThat's what you would think. ÊYou can't call them wasabi noodles if there's no hint of wasabi in them. ÊAnd they definitely did not salt what could have been a decent steak. ÊHere's a clue: ÊIf a diner asks for a side of hot sauce, "any kind", and puts it all over everything, then you have a problem in the kitchen. ÊAfter all that, we were glad we took a gamble and gave the dessert menu a chance. ÊThe passion fruit crme brulee, with its deliciously tangy custard perfectly caramelized all the way to the edges, left somewhat of a favorable impression. ÊWhat's the big deal about this place?

The House is like good 'ol home cooking with a flair. I mean, you walk in and it is literally shaped like someone's living room. It's pretty tight and cramped in the restaurant. If you don't mind sitting 1 foot from the people next to you then the House may as well be your favorite restaurant. Their Sea Bass and striped cod dishes are so fresh, flavorful and well portioned. The fish dishes are buttery and perfectly seasoned not fishy and salty at all. A great place to eat if you're looking for great seafood dishes. The House should buy out the greek restaurant next door and expand their restaurant. Yeah! =)

update 13 Apr 07: Êcame here with a couple of friends. Êi was excited to try some of their other fare. Êfor the appetizer we tried their deep-fried salmon roll with chinese mustard (it was good, but i think deepfrying it overcooked it for me - i only like salmon in its rawest form, or smoked, but never cooked - the mustard sauce really kicks you in the head - be careful!). Êwe had a butter lettuce salad with golden raisins and pear (at least i think that's what it was, it was a special and it was pretty tasty). Êi ordered the duck breast special with a blackberry reduction which was good. Êmy friends ordered the sea bass (it's his favorite) and his wife ordered the ribeye and they both enjoyed their food. Êto finish it off we had the strawberry upside down cake (still good, but not as tasty as the first time) and the bittersweet chocolate cake a la mode (i think that was the name of it, anyways it was on the average side, nothing special). Êi think overall the food was not as spectacular as my first time, more like a 4 this go around, SO let's average it to 4.5 and round up =) Êstill better than any other fusion place i've been to. original: Êbefore the house came along, i HATED fusion. Êfusion for me was a chef pulling the worst elements of several cultures and mashing them into a "dish." Êin one trip, i was enlightened (ommmmmm, light shines through clouds). Êso this is what happens when they incorporate the good stuff from different cultures - wow! Êso what changed my life? Ê - calamari salad (good) - roasted unagi with avocado sushi rice (oh yeah!) - steamed mussels with garlic infused shrimp broth (we fended off the waiter who wanted to take away our "empty" dish, um, hello there was still broth in there.) - my friend had the black cod special (cooked to perfection!) - i had the kobe beef special (there's never enough) - to top it all off, strawberry upside down cake a la mode (sensational!) hey, and great and friendly service to boot! Êso for those of you seeking enlightenment re: fusion, this is the place for you. Êmade me a believer!

well first off i would like to thank meghan for telling me about this spot.. it was truly an amazing dinner.. everything on the plate compliments the other things on the plate. for instance.. i ordered the much raved about sea bass.. it came with green beans and noodles.. the flavor of the sauces on each dish on the plate worked perfectly with each other.. steven ordered the filet and it came out to a perfect med rare.. i didnt try it but he said it was amazing.. we started with the white shrimp dumplings and although they were not crispy as i normally enjoy them to be, i really was digging them.. the only bad thing about my dinner were the salmon rolls.. i think we got a bad piece because they tasted almost as if the salmon was bad or old.. to be honest it didnt mess the night up though.. the wine was great we both has a glass of the prisoner which is a blend of zin cab and merlot.. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS WINE! it made the dinner!! this place is hidden and parking is a bitch in a half.. also it is on a hill so if you are like me and are wearing 6 inch heels this can get tricky but it was worth the obstacles for the awesome food.. anyway im still dreaming of that sea bass and can not wait to return to this gem!!

ÊThe funny thing about this place is that the menu downplays the elaborate plating and flavors of the food---It's beautiful and includes many different components. ÊMy uncle's eyes were rolling back in his head as he tasted the scallop Caesar salad and cod with sushi. ÊI was incredibly impressed with the beautiful plating of the asparagus in sesame oil and sea bass with green beans and noodles. ÊThe flavors really explode in your mouth and are incredibly complex. ÊI think this meal made my uncle finally decide to move to California! ÊHaving been a pastry chef, I have to admit I was disappointed by the desserts. ÊI had a coconut creme brulee with passion fruit sauce poured directly on the bruleed top. ÊIt just looked messy and the burnt sugar flavor (over-bruleed) and the intense passion fruit overwhelmed the coconut. ÊMy uncle had a tasty but uninspired dense chocolate truffle tart. ÊThe service was perfect and speedy. ÊLess ambiance here means lower prices and casual dining. ÊI'll definitely be back for the entrees but will grab dessert elsewhere.

My one and only experience here was decent enough a few years ago. ÊFor a special occasion, with friends flying in from Denver, thought it would be a great place to celebrate two of their birthdays. ÊFor a party of seven, a reservation is prudent. ÊThus, I call, they say for a party of six or more the owner has to call me back. ÊI ask for a call back the same day, called before lunch time so figured it would be enough time for a response. ÊI get a call back the next day. ÊThat's perfectly fine. ÊI'm told there's no table for the desired time, only 630pm and 930pm. ÊSince the earlier time wouldn't work, I said I'll take 930pm and will call back if I can't find a different reservation. ÊI was asked for a credit card to hold the table, if I fail to call and cancel, I will be charged $10pp. ÊThis is fine and dandy but I had to chuckle and tell her no thanks. ÊWhy? ÊThe tone of her voice and the way "Casey" talked to me, I was treated like second class, like I was doing her a favor. ÊIsn't a restaurant part of the service industry? ÊIsn't it supposed to be welcoming? ÊThe food is decent not anything to rave about, but thought my friends would enjoy it. ÊToo bad they will not. ÊThey will instead hear about my bad experience in trying to set reservations where we could've have spent hundreds of dollars. ÊMy friends and colleagues will hear about it too. ÊO snap!

Had dinner with a good friend here after leaving the company holiday party(before it got too out of hand!). Chose this place for a different taste in North Beach. Friendly atmosphere with a tantalizing fusion menu. ÊTrue, its small and not much for ambience, but nonetheless a friendly placefor good conversation(crowded, but I can see why) . We shared two entrees--the seared raw ahi tuna and the promegranate pork chop. The ahi tuna was deliciously fresh, but I thought the (tangy mustard-based) sauce was too typical for this dish. The second plate was extraordinarily beautiful, in both presentation and taste. The promegranate sauce caramelized and poured heavenly over mashed potatoes and the chop, with the pork cooked to perfection and juicy inside. For dessert, we chose to split the coconut creme brulee. The portion was perfect for two, even as we contemplated about licking the remainder! It was really that good... I'd choose this restaurant just for the creme brulee.. mm .. heaven. Reservations recommended.

We came here a 2nd time since the black cod was really good however the service was pretty snooty. ÊWe arrived 10 min before our 1:30pm reservation only to be told that we had to sit in the back next to the banging pots and pans in the kitchen and the crashing of dirty dinner plates. ÊWhy did you give up our table when we weren't even late? ÊOur waitress seemed very terse and impatient to get our order in with hardly a smile. With the kitchen noise rather disturbing we asked if we could sit in some vacated spots but since our food just came in the waitress had to get our tables ready. ÊThe food is good but really overpriced and if the service had been as pleasant to us as it was to the white folks, maybe we would have thought about returning next time we're in the city. ÊWon't be advertising for The House anymore to my friends and relatives--even took several cards last time, I was so impressed. Pride cometh before the fall.

Too hard to rate a place a 5-star on the first visit, but I feel it was that good. ÊThis place was referred by a good friend, so my wife and I came here for our anniversary/dinner date on a Thursday. ÊThe place was packed front to back, but we had made reservations and didn't really have to wait that long, even arriving a little late. ÊLuckily parking wasn't too bad, someone was leaving as we got there right in front of it. ÊIf that wasn't the case, we probably would of parked a block or two away. ÊThe environment/setting was very nice, decorations, lighting, etc. ÊWe both pretty much ordered the same thing, sharing the deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard and each had the wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak. ÊBoth steaks cooked as ordered and for the price we paid, we got a nice hefty portion, flavored really good and left satisfied. ÊLooking forward to coming back soon even though it is at least an hour drive for us.

Great Great asian fusion. ÊThe placed was PACKED. ÊIt's very small and lots of tables jammed into the space so it's very loud and all the patrons sit close together. There is only 1 really bad table in the place...it's back by the kitchen and bathrooms. We were first sat at this table which was very disappointing because the servers kept carrying dirty dishes into the kitchen right by our table. When we asked to move, it was a completely different experience - much better lighting, atmosphere and ambience. ÊNow to the food...Impeccable presentation. The baked salmon roll appetizer is unforgettable. Also, I highly recommend trying one of the seafood/fish specials. I had the Ono and it was outstanding. My dad had the wasabi noodles with steak and that was outstanding as well. My mom loved the ahi tuna entree as well and all the desserts are out of this world too. Overall, the food is fantastic. It's a young trendy place but not very romantic.

In short, the House is not for those who shy away from expressive, creative dishes with an intense taste. The food itself is fresh and prepared to perfection (i.e. no soggy veggies or grease laden fried food). The dishes are not only tasty, but artistically presented with loads of color to match the flavor of the food. It's worth every penny (including the desert).

Phrases uttered as I left this restaurant: "I'm going to yelp the !$?# out of this place" and "I'm going to yelp this place silly." In all honesty, a completely incredible meal in every way. From appetizers to main dishes to desserts the food is simply exquisite and they could easily charge double for it (Shhh! We can't let them know). I cannot think of a better place to receive my first 5 star rating. By the way, the service is incredible too. The entire restaurant is as big as a size 11 shoe box so we were definitely seated after our reservations. To make up for it, two appetizers and a dessert- gratis. That is how you run a business.

if you enjoy fusion and adore strong flavors, this place is most definitely for you. i think they do a great blend of american and asian food together, with strong flavors like the generous use of salty soy sauce and horseradish, finished with great presentation. every dish served up was so pleasing to the eye, as well as the mouth. recommend the ahi tuna and the black cod, which was one of their specials the night i went. had the chocolate expresso bread pudding for dessert. it tasted more like cake than pudding, but still super good. one of my favorite places in north beach, by far.

I absolutely LOVE the food here... it's the best place to go on a date. I love asian fusion, but only if it's done correctly, and believe me, they do it right here. If you plan on going, ALWAYS call in for a reservation, otherwise, you'll have to wait 30-45 minutes for a table. The food is well priced for the quality, and the setting is very intimate with candle lit tables, low lighting, and a nice selection of wines. But again, call in for a reservation, otherwise, you'll probably blow your date, and won't get lucky! =)

the reason for the 5 star is the value. Êthis is quintessential Asian fusion and they get it right. Êthe papaya beef salad is phenom and I like that the dishes with heat have actual heat. Êit's not Thai spicy but it has some kick which is nice. ÊThe creme brulee is a little too sour for me but the rice pudding dessert is a revelation. ÊIt reminded me of what I would eat as a kid but with a really nice grown up flavor. ÊYou can't beat the price either. ÊMost expensive dish is $26. ÊThe steak is really good. ÊDefinitely come in a group of 4 if you can so you can try multiple dishes. ÊAny larger and it will be a challenge getting seating. ÊCome early. It could easily be a place that charges more and if it did, I'd give it 4 stars but for the value 5 star. We had Ahi Tuna dinner, I had SwordFish special with coconut curry, wife had steak, other friend had another fish dish. ÊAhi Tuna anywhere to me is blase but the other dishes were definite A game.

i'm not much of an asian fusion fan. i kind of just cast it off as asian food for those who can't handle true ethnic tastes. i just like traditional asian cuisines. period. my boyfriend insisted i try the kobe beef at house. House has made me a believer, in that i should be more open, and i will no longer knock asian fusion restaurants. i've been here on a monday night for the special of the day, domestic kobe beef. i was a little hesitant, b/c it was "domestic", and i was in a snobby mood, so i was thinking, the kobe beef i had at the wynn at the sw steakhouse would completely shatter my meal of domestic kobe beef into lame slices of mere mediocrity, but i was pleasantly put in my place. i had my beef cooked medium rare, it came with stringy potato fries (super thin. kinda annoying to eat after a while, since they're so skinny and you just want to eat already, but you have to grab a handful so you can at least feel like you're eating something instead of potato toothpicks. it was succulent, juicy, tasty, mouthwatering, and you finish with a fairly satisfied appetite (i had the scallop appetizer before this) but being me, i was still itching for more. it was so delicious! Êi would def come back here to either try a new dish, but why do that when your first time was such an experience, i'd def like to replay that again. its a shame that its only on certain nights. i also had the seared scallops as an appetizer. topped with sprouts. it was cooked just right. def NOT rubbery and overcooked, it was nicely seared but NOT charred. it was an interesting spin b/c it was the first time i've had scallops seasoned like you would a steak. it was like grill seasoning. very good. it wasn't overpowered by sauces or other bells and whistles. it was just plain good. fresh ingredients too. decor - modern, low key, candlelit, good for pairs (dates) and groups up to 6 people or so, clean bathrooms. service - excellent, unobtrusive, always there for refills, staff is easily accessible in case you have concerns or requests. parking sucks around this area (where does it not?), but its still worth it! location of the restaurant is nice b/c its close to a lot of shops and restaurants, so its nice to just walk around and take it in and chat w/ a companion, if you're waiting to be seating you can pop your head in next door to a cute clothing shop for women. i didn't think too much for the desserts, so i walked across the street and got some great tiramisu from some cafe in little italy!!! :)

I rate The House as the lifetime highlight of my San Francisco experience. Luckily, my friend and I reserved a table early on a Friday evening and didn't have to wait long. For starters we ordered the deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard which was very tasty and pleasingly different from your traditional sushi rolls as well as the asparagus with roasted sesame dressing which almost melted in your mouth. It was difficult making a decision on the main entree; I was torn between the niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce and the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. In the end, the waitress talked me into trying the angus ribeye steak with housemade teriyaki and toasted garlic butter. I made the right choice. I have never had a more heavenly dinner as I did at The House. Each forkful was bursting with flavor, creativity and complexity. I don't think there's anyone else out there who can pull off these dishes. Of course, I had to try their dessert as well and chose the persimmon bread pudding with ice cream. It was like eating spoonfuls of warm, gingerbread creme brulee drizzled with caramel sauce. The House is always first on my list of restaurants when I visit San Francisco and perfect for dates, friends and family.

I canceled my reservations for the Slanted Door for this place. ÊAny place that has sea bass I have to try. ÊDid this seabass kick ass? ÊEhhh... i'm still on the fence on this one. ÊDefinitely a large and fatty, tender piece.. A little too fatty for my liking...And the side sauce was a bit too salty. ÊBut it had such a fresh flavor and melted like butter. ÊThe noodles disappointed though. ÊI was expecting garlic noodles and I just came from pomelo the night before. ÊThe noodles tasted like take out Chinese soft noodles. ÊI really liked the sauteed green beans though.. It had great flavor. ÊThe hubby had the ramen which he said was really flavorable and one of the best ramen bowls he had.

I'm going to give this restaurant 3 stars for the overall experience, however the food alone does deserve 4 stars. ÊI've been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile because I've heard such good things. ÊI went with a friend who I hadn't seen in awhile and we wanted to have a leisurely dinner to catch up. ÊThe place is extremely small, so we had to whisper sometimes just so the table next to us didn't hear our entire conversation. Ê ÊWe ended up splitting both the halibut and the sea bass. Both were good, but the sea bass was amazing. ÊWe ordered an appetizer and they didn't ask us if we were finished before they took the plate away. ÊWhen we finished the main course, the waitress brought us the desert menu and asked us probably 4 times if we wanted to order anything.

My friend Diana and I came to eat here last nite, and because there are so many great recommendations on Yelp and from friends, we got a little bit of everything. We ordered the White shrimp and chinese chive dumplings and Caesar salad with crispy scallops to start with. The Dumplings were really good. Our server warned us about the sauce being a little bit spicy, but when I tried it, all I tasted was chilli. I couldn't figure out what exactly the sauce tasted like. But the dumplings on its own were good. ÊThe caesar salad with scallops were alright, nothing specatular. Then she ordered the Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy - and the sea bass literally melts in your mouth like butter. So good! I ordered the Karubuto ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce. The pork chop was cooked medium and was just the right amount of tenderness, and the sauce was pretty good. I didn't finish the pork chop because I had to save room for our two desserts: coconut creme brulee with passion fruit glaze and the mango tapioca. The coconut creme brulee was excellent Ê- but I didn't think the glaze complemented it that well. I enjoyed the creme brulee very much (I ate it all), but I could have done without the passion fruit glaze (it was tart and almost strangely sour). The mango tapioca was yummy, and Diana scarfed that down. We topped it all off with a pot of jasmine pearl tea. ÊWe left the House pretty satisfied and very stuffed. Will definitely come back for more yummy food.

They provided a complimentary plate of pickled cucumbers--a refreshing departure from the usual bread basket. ÊAs an aperitif, I had the sparkling rose' from France that was lip-smacking good. ÊNext came the tuna tartare that was likeable but unremarkable. On the plus, the tortilla strips offered textural crispness and the pool of sauce had a bright flavor, but the fish quality was so-so. ÊThe grilled sea bass with garlic noodles and green beans was fine, but the main flavor was soy sauce, soy sauce and, oh!, more...soy...sauce--can't fault it for complexity. ÊThe flat-iron steak with wasabi noodles and kimchee veggies was better. ÊThe meat was the requested medium-rare with a good spicy flavor.

ÊFor appetizers, we ordered the mussels (they don't have bread, so make sure to get some rice for the delicious sauce), deep fried salmon rolls (with spicy wasabi mustard sauce, yum!!), and the special that day, shiitake mushroom soup with truffle oil.

Delicious!

They were topped off with some greens of some sort (unfortunately don't remember) and some sweet sauce that looked liked mustard, but I think contained honey. Regardless, it was off the hook! She said that it would be cooked medium. It was cooked perfectly! I also had a special for dinner - the black cod topped with California some Chinese broccoli underneath.

Who's in the house? ÊI'm in the house! ÊBring in the beat. Ê My all time favorite restaurant in San Francisco and that is a bold statement which I stand by. ÊI adore The House. Ê I wish I could make The House my house and eat from it's kitchen everyday. ÊEvery dish I have ever had here and there have been many many many of them has been excellent. ÊEvery person I have ever brought here has walked out beyond satisfied. ÊThere are not many places you can visit on a consistent basis and have it be dead on every time. ÊEVERY TIME!!! ÊThe Sea Bass is the one I always come back to but the wasbi noodles, the blue lake tempura green beans, the specials.......mmm..... ÊMess with the house and you mess with me! ÊNot that I'm scary.....

One of the best restaurant experiences I've had in years. The atmosphere was fine and simple - a bit crowded and noisy. However, the food made the place feel bigger and the atmosphere spa like. The food is what matters here folks. Every taste of every dish was full of unique and artful flavor. I always judge a place according to whether I get a feeling that a real love of food and making the dishes is permeating in the each fork full (or spoonful, chopsticks full..) I put in my mouth. Creative, but not trying too hard. Perfect portions. Thank you, thank you, thank you! FYI - the customer service was lovely.

I'm going to have to join in with the chorus of "ehs" about this place. The service was excellent, which is always appreciated, but the food was kinda mediocre. We started with the crab cake, which had an interesting presentation (I forget exactly, but some kind of tower of crunchy stuff), and it was tasty, but, you know, very fried. Like, the kind of crab cake I could probably grab at a sports bar, but with better presentation. A lot of fried breading and a little bit of crab meat and some tartar sauce is always going to taste good, but I wasn't really that impressed. I got what I think was a butterfish in ginger soy broth (or miso broth?), and the boyfriend got the steak and wasabi noodles. I thought the broth that the fish was in was bland, bland, bland, although I think there were some tasty vegetables of some kind. The steak was cooked just right, which was a plus, but again, it just wasn't that special. The noodles were my favorite part, the right amount of spice for my taste, Êbut they were still pretty standard fare. It was a bit of a celebration, so we went for dessert, which we usually don't do, and let me tell you, the chocolate cake is incredibly boring. It tastes like brownie out of a box, and it's not even served warm! Overall, the food isn't *bad*, exactly, it's just not that exciting, and the execution of the fusion concept seems a little incoherent. Tartar sauce? At an Asian Fusion place? Really?

Asian fusion done well, but still falls into the Asian fusion trap: an over-reliance on sauce that ends up masking (delicate Asian) food. That said, the grilled sea bass was the one of the best I've ever had (crispy, chewy, flaky, buttery all at once). Grilled salmon sushi roll was notable for its miso sauce. Pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce was overcooked.

Went back last week for the second time and I have to say I wasn't blown away like I was the first time eating there. ÊDon't get me wrong - it was still delicious. ÊWe ordered the kobe papaya salad which was a special that evening and it was delicious. ÊAlso had the pork chop with pomegranate sauce (I know that's not the name of the dish) and it was delicious as well. ÊThe salmon rolls were good but the major disappointment of our meal was the sea bass entree that we ordered. ÊThe first time I had this dish it was so amazing - this time it was dry and overcooked. ÊThe sea bass comes with snap peas and wasabi noodles ... the noodles were a little too rich to go with this dish. ÊThe next time I return I'll just get the kobe papaya salad (if it's offered) and the pork chop.

Well, this is still one of my favorite restaurants in the city, but I had my first unsatisfying food experience out of the five or six times I've been here. ÊI'm pretty sensitive to the idea of an overpriced Caesar salad, considering that my business sells one, so I was hoping that the crispy scallops that came with theirs would be a great selling point. ÊThey were not. ÊWhile the greens in the salad were tasty, the tempura-battered bay scallops were not particularly crispy, nor tasty. ÊReally, I couldn't detect a hint of scallop taste in the things, probably because they were BAY scallops. ÊLook, if I'm paying that much for a Caesar salad, I expect my crispy scallops to be either SEA scallops, or extremely flavorful bay scallops - not bland, battered, little wastes of space. ÊThis is not enough to take a star off of The House for me, because their salmon roll (a perfectly cooked, stuffed spring roll with delicious hot Chinese mustard) more than made up for the disappointment, not to mention their great service in slipping us in between reserved parties. ÊThat said, don't order the Caesar salad.

After seeing The House on Check Please and reading yelp reviews...I knew I wanted to check this place out. I made the journey from the East Bay and after walking to North Beach from Bart I was thirsty and not in the mood for wine so I ordered an Ommegang Belgian beer-score! ÊNext we ordered the Ahi app followed by the Seabass and I ordered the Ahi for my main course (I'm from Hawaii and can't get enough.) The food was flavored/cooked to perfection--the best meal I've had all year (and I eat out a lot!). One slight criticism was that our waitress was not very warm or personable but I think the entire staff was a bit flustered due to a large private party. However, I'm still giving this restaurant five starts because the food was so good ---with Ahi cooked to perfection, washed down with one of the best beers of all time... I wish I could give this place ten stars. I will be baaaaaack.....p.s. owners...please please please open a house in the East Bay!

I can't believe it's taken me this long to try The House. I feel like I've been missing out on so much! Dinner reservations is a must because this place is tiny and snug. I'd suggest paying attention to the server as she lists the specials because they were a hit! They had these seared scallops with ponzu sauce. It was absolutely divine! The other special we had werethe bbq oysters. They were big and juicy and hot off the grill. It had a bit too much bbq sauce on it, but I was able to scrape some of it off. For my entrŽe, I had the sea bass, which was topped with garlic ginger soy and satt on a bed of string beans and garlic noodles. The noodles were a bit salty but I can't complain about the sea bass. It had a crispy char on the outside and a buttery juicy taste on the inside. He had the Angus ribeye steak which was incredible. Portions here are very filling and the plating is awesome. Colorful and bold. We were just about done with dinner until we saw the server bring out crme brulee to another table. We HAD to have it. Much to my surprise, it was a lemon crme brulee, which I typically wouldn't order because I'm not a fan of lemon. BUT, it was an excellent pairing: the tangy crme and the sweetness of the carmalized sugar. Dinner was like a party in my mouth. I'll be coming back here to try the other items on their menu. Prices are fair and well worth the quality of food you're getting. Total bill for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and dessert: $85.

My friend suggested this restaurant for my bf and I to go to for our anniversary and after reading the yelp reviews we decided to cancel our reservations at another restaurant. ÊWe ordered the shitake mushroom soup with white truffle oil, Kobe beef, and the sea bass. ÊI actually wanted to have the black cod, but it wasn't on the menu for the night so I didn't ask until we overheard the waitress offer it to the table beside us. ÊI was disappointed when the waitress told me the cook already started the sea bass, but it ended up being a good thing because I loved the sea bass and I can try the black cod next time I go. ÊLike the waitress told me, don't be afraid to ask for something just because it's not on the menu! ÊIf they have the ingredients, the chef will cook it at your request. ÊI would've given this restaurant 5 stars, but the green beans that came with my dish were very tough and unappetizing so I hardly ate it. ÊThe portions are definitely generous though so I was still full after finishing everything else. ÊOverall this restaurant has great service and delicious food.

freaking delicious! Last Saturday was my food adventure day which i do once in awhile. I go for a long walk and see what look good and try it. i decided to go to The House because my girlfriend recommend it to me and i know my girlfriend knows about good food. I open the door and i was lucky to get a table right away. the place is small but is an awsome place to bring your friends and hang out and talk about anything. I order the Warm wasabi house noodles with grilled salmon. while I was waiting for my noodles they brought me a cold cucumber appetizer which had sesame seeds (Tsukemono style). when i got my food it look freaking good. when i had the first bite i could not believe I could taste the wasabi. most of the time when you cook wasabi with food the flavor of the wasabi is not strong enough or you can't even taste it. However the wasabi with the noddles was just right. I wasn't hungry but i did finish my noddles! I'm coming back for more!

Went to the house on a sat night- late about 10 45 and it was still packed. I had read all the reviews and was prepared to be let down. I was not. it was great. and by great i mean DEEEELLLIIISSHHH. we started with the fried salmon roll. i hate salmon and this was sinful. i had the ahi which was great and my bf had the steak. both were so great we wanted to come back for more. the only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is they don't have a full bar.....

By now, The House has amassed a loyal group of devotees who love fresh ingredients, impeccably prepared cuisine, and flavors that marry the best of East and West. My own personal favorites include the crab cake, which is perfectly seasoned with plenty of crab meat, as well as the seabass and pork chop. The seabass is marinated in a sweet and savory soy and, I presume, grilled, giving it a subtly smoky flavor. One of the highpoints on the menu is the pork chop. Thick but tender, this is the mother of all pork chops! Tasting vaguely of classic chinese char chiu pork, yet prepared using western techniques, it is a little taste of heaven. In short, the food here is exceptional and for the quality, a bargain. The service is also extremely efficient and no fuss. The interior of the restaurant is soft, subtle, very cozy, and always packed with adoring foodies. I could not ask for a better dining experience, and recommend all to visit or revisit it!

Okay, this review is biased as I used to work here. But I can honestly say that I crave the food here, like a junky likens to crack. The salmon rolls... salmon, wrapped in seaweed and rice paper is and deep fried to a perfect crisp with the salmon still pink in the middle with a great wasabi soy dipping sauce. His coleslaw is a fusion of different textures and layers of flavors, vinegar, ginger, spicy and sweet. A guilty pleasure of mine is the Chilean sea bass which is cooked perfectly , flaky, moist and the seasoning is yummy and is accompanied by a sweet ginger soy. The chef cleans and cuts the fish himself. Curry Noodles with grilled chicken is also one of my many favorites. The noodles are tender, the curry sauce is velvety with good heat and the chicken is grilled and seasoned with soy and other spices. The chef is brilliant when it comes to layering flavors and textures. Lamb chops, Pork chops, any sashimi on the special menu, eat it up and savor those flavors... his food is definitely a culinary experience not to be missed. Many have tried to take on his ideas...but I have yet to come across food as delicious and inventive as his. It gets very busy here...so I recommend reservations.

This place was packed on a Saturday night. We made a reservation at 9pm for 4 people and didn't mind the late reservation because we were watching some March Madness basketball and waiting for a friend. We got there on the dot, and still had to wait 30 minutes. However, the staff was very nice about it and even gave us a free appetizer (the salmon roll thing, which was delicious). I ordered the steak with wasabi noodles, which was cooked perfectly and came with tons of meat. Two friends got fish dishes, which were also good (miso snapper and a cod). The other person got a kobe special. The dessert was also good. We got the mango tapioca, which was pretty light. This ended up costing almost $50/person (because we shared a bottle of wine and 2 other appetizers). I don't know if it was worth that price, but the food was pretty good.

This place is awesome!! This place is in a little nook in between Chinatown and NorthBeach, and it was definitely a real find. ÊAlthough the restaurant is quite small and cramped and the ambience was simple, the food just squashed everything else.

ÊThe presentation was beautiful and the ahi was cooked just right (still raw). ÊThere is this wasabe puree to add color to the plate and it will get your eyes watering.... For desert, we had the special for the day key lime pie. ÊIt was super sour but was generally what is expected. ÊThe mango tapica was a unique desert...very creamy like a soup with soft tapica...I would get that next time. The service was excellent....maybe because we had the manager serving us and he knew the menu inside and out. Definitely go here for some good food!!

Went here to celebrate our 15th anniversary. ÊMy husband and I were a little hesitant but could not resist ordering the same thing we had the last time...I ordered the cod special and he ordered the sea bass. ÊIt was as delicious as we remembered and expected! ÊThis time we tried the scallop appetizer. ÊAgain everything was perfect. ÊI just wish that we lived closer to The House...we would be regulars here.

OK, this place was good. ÊThe food tasted good, was pretty interesting/unique, and was reasonably priced. ÊService was good as well. ÊWe got the deep fried salmon rolls, the BBQ oysters, and grilled calamari in a spicy sauce as appetizers. ÊThe oysters were huge, but that was my least favorite b/c it was like backyard BBQ sauce on oysters (although the gremolata on top was really good). ÊI was really excited about the deep fried salmon rolls, but they were kind of over-cooked (which i guess is necessary for it to keep its shape). ÊThe mustard sauce was great... but I love all kinds of mustard. ÊMy entree was just OK... it was one of their specials... Halibut in coconut curry with mussels. The fish was cooked nicely and I liked the tomato/potatos and especially corn in the curry. ÊBut the other entrees (sea bass, pork chop) looked better. ÊDessert was good. ÊNow while all the food was good, it wasn't awesome. ÊPeople were talking to each other at the restaurant orgasming about "oh this is my favorite restaurant, this food is the best I've ever had, etc..."... and the reviews say much of the same thing. ÊBlah... yes I'd recommend it to anyone, but it didn't blow my mind. ÊThe best part of the experience was after dinner, we were standing outside and this hot drunk chick was running down the hill and she total face-planted on the pavement. ÊI think she started crying.

An unsual find in North Beach and a little (really little) gem of a spot -- and I am not just saying that because one of my fellow diners is friends with the owners and the restaurant has become her favorite away-from-home dining room. ÊAppetizers were super-tasty and my entree delectable. ÊI finished with a citrusy creme brulee which was outstanding. ÊThe prices were up there for the portion size but not necessarily for the quality of the food or the San Francisco market. ÊIt was a little too fusion, I think, for one of my fellow diners but he's a self-admitted "no longer adventurous due to his age" type and he did pick-up the pricey tab! ÊI liked the decor, particularly the frames cleverly inset into the wall (how'd they do that?) but the place was on the noisy side, luckily our fellow diner ("the insider") garnished the perfect table which was buffered by a wall on one side! ÊI'll be back (I said that with an Ah-nold sort of accent!)

Solid food but the waitstaff rushed us through our meal. ÊWhile we still had two appetizers on our table, barely eaten, the waiter told us that our entrees were about to come out. ÊIt was as if he was warning us that there would be no room on our table for the additional food we ordered. ÊAfter ordering dessert, the bill came a couple minutes after the dishes arrived. ÊWe were not offered coffee, and when I asked for more water, the waitstaff appeared irritated. ÊClearly, this place is more interested in turning tables than serving their existing customers. ÊAgain, good food but cramped quarters and rushed service greatly marred the experience. ÊFor the prices they charge, they should not make people feel like they're in a race to finish their meal.

Êservice was great. we were seated promptly. food was delicious but portions were a bit wanting (a bit light?). definitely order appetizers and there would probably be room for dessert as well. - nice to walk around the neighborhood before getting our table - we ordered one appetizer i believe - i had miso fish (good but i wished the portion were bigger?) - friend had the steak/beef (tasted better than mine) - i heard they're big on wine if you like that... it was a good time! like i said a tiny intimate dinner would make this an enjoyable experience for you. reserve in advance for the best options.

Started with the perfect White shrimp and chinese chive dumplings. They were served with this spicy sauce that bathed my taste buds in six or seven different flavors. Moved on to the masterful Maine crab cake with pickled ginger remoulade. These were just our appetizers and we were already enchanted with the experience. We had heard about the Niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce and it lived up to its reputation. The left over pomegranate currant sauce was poured on everyone else's meat dish. We finished with a special Kobe beef NY strip beef steak served over white wax beans. Our desert was the chocolate cake with a strong and wonderful coconut flavor. Simply a perfect meal and a gem we will share with everyone. The service was nice, but trying to rush us out a bit after only 45 minutes at the table. It is a small and popular restaurant and a line was forming at the door (at 10:30 at night). Make reservations ahead of time so the wait doesn't damage the perfect dining. This restaurant gets on of my rarely awarded five starts.

One word describes this place and the food.. amazing.. For starters our group shared the salmon roll, hamachi and ahi dish, all were simply great, I would have to say the salmon roll was the best of the trio. For the main course, I opted for the rib eye steak. Loved it.. Great flavor and cooked just right. What I love about this place is that, they are priced just right for the food they serve. Great food at very fair prices. Paid about $40.00/person in our group and that included appetizers, main course & desert.. can't beat that.. Only negative... PARKING..... -1 star for having to drive around for 20 mins.. they need valet here!

I've eaten here before so my reservation on Valentine's Day came with high expectations. ÊSadly I was very dissapointed. ÊThe "special" menu left quite a bit to be desired. ÊWe started out with the scallop appetizer and it was cooked very well and set a good opener for the night. ÊOr so I thought. ÊWe had the kobe beef tartare which sounded good on paper but when it arrived it was mixed with some chile verde style stuff and placed on a buttered brioche. ÊIt was decent but I would have liked to have been able to taste the kobe beef as it should have been the focal point of the dish. ÊInstead it's flavor was buried and i could not tell what kind of meat it was. ÊThe next dish was pork belly and mushroom salad which was okay but they skimped on the pork belly and that was the main reason why I ordered it. ÊFor entrees I chose the pork butt with fois gras in a miso broth and upon my suggestion my girl got the Hawaiian butterfish and mussels in a curry broth. ÊMy pork butt was cooked beautifully but the odd topping of a morsel of cold fois gras was really out of place. ÊIn addition the fois gras was seared but served to me cold. ÊI couldn't figure that one out. ÊThe miso broth was way too salty and left me slamming my glass of wine with reckless abandon. ÊMy girlfriends' butterfish was way overcooked and nothing reminiscent of the butterfish I ate in Oahu. ÊI felt bad for recommending it to her. ÊThe curry broth had good flavor and the muscles were large but to have to entrees served in a broth on the same menu seemed like a culinary cop out. ÊWhen we saw the desserts we were crestfallen when there was no passion fruit creme brulee to be found. ÊWhy would you remove that from the menu when everyone who has tasted it knows it is truly orgasmic and befitting on Valentine's Day? ÊWe settled for the meyer lemon pot de creme and the persimon pudding cake catastrophe. ÊThe lemon thing was so sour it made our faces cringe. ÊI HAVE NEVER HAD A DESSERT THAT TERRIBLE BEFORE. ÊWhoever made that didn't taste it and should be ashamed of themselves. ÊThe persimmon cake pudding whatever tasted like a shitty spongy cross between pumpkin pie and gingerbread. ÊIf I hadn't paid for them I would have left them to die alone. ÊSadly, This menu was a total letdown and showed me the lack of range at this restaurant. ÊWhoever put this menu together didn't think this through and they should just stick to what they do best. ÊBring back the old menu and leave it at that.

Make sure to make reservations or you will be eating at a cheesy chinese restaurant nearby. The sea-bass with their special noodles is awesome. I think I've been here at least five times in the last six months and always had the sea-bass. Ê If you love liver, you have got to order their liver salad, a great start to the entree. Highly recommend this place. However, if you are on a first time date and nervous about people next to you listening to your business, then another venue is better.

Called on Saturday afternoon and they were able to squeeze us in at 630. This place is always packed due to the small space. Should have went somewhere else since I knew they were gonna try to rush us out for the next group. For appetizer we had the fried calamari and the crab cakes. The calamari, although tasty was over-fried and almost burnt. I found the crab cakes too moist since it was prepared in a cone-shaped mound rather than the traditional pancake style. As for our entrees, the seabass, seared ahi tuna and cod were all very tasty. They know how to prepare fish! Price was average but the three stars goes to the rushed service and not so good appetizers. If you're into cal cusine with an asian influence, the house is a very good choice, but make sure you make reservations at least a day in advance.

I went there a while back with friends. I heard so many great things so I was excited to eat there. The restaurant itself it not large. Its long and narrow. It has nice decor. Our server was not great. As she was telling us the specials, she yelled across the table to a co-server teller her to leave the table. How about you excuse yourself to speak with her rather than yell at someone mid-sentence? We ordered appetizers (oysters - very good, crab cakes - mushy) and entrees (seabass - ok, I've had better at a chinese restaurant for weddings, salmon - friend didnt care for it, porkchop - good). From reputation, it didn't meet expectation. Maybe they were having an off night but it didn't make a good impression to get me back.

I was visiting SF for the weekend and wanted to eat at a good restaurant with a cute ambiance and thought The House was perfect! ÊI thought the food was great for the price (I believe this should be $$ instead of $$$). ÊI got the Flank Steak with Wasabi Noodles ($17) and a glass of wine ($8), the food was great, I would really recommend it. ÊThe steak was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. ÊI thought the Wasabi Noodles was bland at first but as I kept eating it started to taste perfect with the steak! ÊI guess being fusion the dishes were a toned down version of the real thing, for example there was some kimchi on top of the noodles but it was was more like cabbage marinated in red pepper flakes, no fermentation and so it's not kimchi in my book. ÊAlso I could barely taste the wasabi in the noodles, I would call it Teriyaki Noodles instead. ÊBut overall it's the perfect place to go to for a casual dinner with friends or a date!

I was overwhelmingly impressed with this place, which is uniquely located near columbus and broadway with all of its "culture" (strip clubs, bars, and City Lights bookstore). ÊIt's been a few months since I have been here so I will leave it to others to recommend specific dishes, but in general the fish is fresh and the portions are very generous.

Even though we had a reservation, it took them a while to get us seated. The service was friendly and efficient. I felt we were being rushed so that the long line of people standing outside can get their turn. That being said, the Sea Bass was divine! It was light, fluffy, juicy and just absolutely delicious. The Salmon rolls lacked flavor but all the other scrumptious appetizers made up for it. Because its such a tiny place, I recommend it for small groups of 4 or less. If you like Asian Fusion food, House is a must.

So many great choices I like to go with others because I can't eat all the things that sound great. The salmon rolls are just perfect. The calamari with tomato sauce (a special) was the best grilled ever. Only thing that was so so was the eel BLT. Great idea and OK but everything else was superb.

It was a bit packed! Yet, I ordered: barbequed oysters, wasabi noodles and steak and creme brulee and apple pie. They were all full of flavor and beyond AMAZING! It is a must in San Francisco!

This restaurant is a hidden gem! Asian fusion and 100% delicious. The caesar salad was great, which seems unlikely at an Asian restaurant. The asparagus in sesame sauce was also delicious. I had flank steak with soba noodles in a wasabi soy sauce -- the steak was so unbelievably tender -- it was better than many filets I have tasted. My friend ordered the ribeye with potatoes and it was also tender, juicy and flavorful. We ended with a perfectly cooked creme bržlŽe!!! All in all, I loved every moment at this restaurant. And on top if it all, the service was attentive and the waitstaff was friendly and professional. Tip: make a reservation to be sure you get in.

The seabass, pork chop and apple pie is all I need for a satisfying meal! The seabass was perfectlyl cooked and seasoned and the pork chops pomegranet sauce pairing was just right! end the meal with some yummy apple pie alamode. Get these items and you will not regret it. I typically don't go for asian fusion food but this place makes really delicious and perfectly cooked food. You must try it!

Okay I have to say that I have been to many fine dining establishments and have thought the food was amazing upon initial visits. ÊThe problem is that repeat visits usually leave me disappointed. ÊI appreciate The House because its been consistently good every time. ÊI usually bring out of town friends because I can be assured that this place wont disappoint. Ê Ê The price is reasonable by SF standards. ÊThe only reason I gave only 4 stars is because the parking is so difficult in North Beach.

So perhaps it was the big group or that it was a Monday night. However, my experience at The House was nothing like it was a few years ago. The seafood was really great, especially the sea bass. However, the meat entrees left much to be desired. The most disappointing part was the service. Our waitress was down-right rude and inattentive leaving us to make comments that she must not care since her tip was included. It was sad as it was a friend's birthday. In the end, I wouldn't go back or recommend it.

Ate at The House based on all the (mostly) rave reviews on Yelp and Trip Advisor. ÊOur expectations therefore were inflated, and, while the food is good, it did not meet with our preinflated expectations. Began with appetizers of hamachi sashimi and unagi over rice. ÊSushi grade hamachi with salad on top-nothing more. ÊThe unagi is grilled nicely, but again these are dishes that should except at any reputable sushi restaurant or izakaya. ÊThe entrees were their signature sea bass-tender and oily but not distinctive. ÊAnd the wasabi noodles with flatiron steak had a nice mild spice to it, but again nondescript. ÊNot really "fusion" but more like a nice Japanese izakaya, albeit with prices that reflect its trendy reputation. ÊAll in all a pleasant meal, but not memorable and seemingly did not match its hype. ÊIt is crowded and noisy, small, but that ads to its hip ambiance and,as other reviews keep stressing, it is nearly imperitive to make reservations, and nice that they do. ÊWe were seated nearly right away as we were led through the crowd bunched in the doorway hoping for a table to open up. ÊJapanese bbq, izakaya, and good sushi restaurants will over much of the same without the price and hassle.

HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!...OVERRATED...RUDE...UNSANITARY...If I could, I would choose NO STARS!!!..We had a party of 9 and reservations at 8:30. ÊThe first of our party showed up at 8 (the rest were there by 8:30) - we were not seated until 9:45 - all along seeing other people getting seated...After arguing with the hostess on seating us, she crammed 9 of us Êin the table that realistically seated 6 - and promised to take care of us. ÊSince it was nearing 10 pm and we have not even started dinner, we felt defeated and just wanted to eat...when the hostess brought our water, she leaned over and her hair completely dipped into a water glass (she kind of resembled Samara from "The Ring", black hair was all over her face and hanging down)....The waitress had a bit of an attitude too...We ordered our apps and actually got them pretty quickly, but dinner took a while. Êwhen dinner came, my husband joked to say after us making a fuss to check your food for hair..well SURPRISE guess what he found...BLACK KINKY HAIR!!!! ÊThe waitress quickly swapped his order, almost so fast, I'm sure someone had to wait for a new order and I had to make sure it wasn't the same plate....Next thing you know, i found a piece of hair on my plate!!!..I called the waitress over again and she proceeded to argue with me that it was not hair, but fuzz from the napkin...I pointed out impossible, as the napkin was WHITE and it was a piece of BLACK HAIR on my plate!! ÊI was so disgusted i could not get a replacement (personally I was afraid what type of manhandling they would do to it)...When the bill came, they charged us for my husband's meal that he had to send back and also charged us gratuity (which we refused to pay)...so where is it in there that they "took care of us" as the claimed - we got 12 wine glasses as opposed to 9 (because we ordered a bottle of white and red)...well that's just great....DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY TO COME TO THIS CRAP HOLE!!!!

I will start this review by stating that I used to hate Asian Fusion. After my several experiences here I must say that I hate Asian Fusion unless it is done right. I've eaten here on numerous occasions and I absolutely love the food here. I especially love the Sea Bass which offers a very exciting combination of flavor for the palate. It is both juicy and savory and the sauce adds just the right amount of zest. The noodles on the side offer a more subtle taste while cleaning the palate again for some more of that sea bass. I also have to say that I love the service here as well, something that you can't generally say about most Asian Restaurants(I'm Asian, so I would know). One particular instance happened a year ago when I had to make reservations for about 14 people. If you've eaten here you know that 14 people is a lot to put into the small space. I honestly thought it was a long shot and I placed the call for the request. The host stated that the owner would need to approve it. I already figured that I was going to get a no and so I was looking for another restaurant that would be more able to accommodate my group. Within about a week the owner called me, which was a shock. Angela, the owner asked me about my group and the occasion, and I stated that I was planning to propose to my girlfriend and I had our friends coming in from out of town to celebrate after. She told me that she could make it happen and approved it on the spot. To have the owner do that and help make that occasion happen was the best, because I really did want to have our dinner there. And it was a great night, one to remember. Awesome place, awesome food, and awesome people.

My first experience was at the Inner Sunset location before it closed down. ÊI loved the food and had my first Valentine's date with my husband six years ago at the North Beach location when we were starving college students. ÊThe food was just as good the second time. ÊEven though it's one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco, I haven't been able to get back too often. ÊHowever, I have never been disappointed when I do eat at the House. ÊLast night, I had dinner after work with some girlfriends and we almost licked our plates clean. ÊThe House just serves up some of the yummiest food in town. ÊThe parking in the area sucks though and that's probably why I don't go out there too often. ÊI did discover a parking garage right where Chinatown meets North Beach (Pacific and Grant). ÊSo if you're willing to throw down 6 or 7 bucks to park just a few blocks away and you make reservations in advance, you can have a pretty hassle-free and delicious meal at the House.

this is NOT one of those places that's like, "oh not all your party is here yet?- Êno seat for you." Êso for that alone you get points. Êbut then they go on to impress us with their tasty, awesome, scrumptious food. Êsome friends from south bay came up and i felt the pressure to take them some place good but not touristy (hard to find in n.beach). Êhouse happened to be a) not italian b) reviewed well in yelp. Êso to house we went. Êand we were not dissapointed. Êit only serves wine and beer but the beer/wine selection was good. Êand the waiter made good reco's re: dishes. Êwe had the following starters: tuna tartar (excellent), clams in spicy miso (pretty good), sea scallops (excellent). Êmy husband and i split the kobe beef special and the sustainable sea bass. ÊYUM. Êi tried my friend's cod with crab special thing and that was excellent as well. Êthe dessert was some chocolately thing but that was super tasty too. Êoverall it was a very good experience but definitely a price tag to match- for my hubby and i it was at least 60 each with drinks, apps, dinner, dessert. Ênot sure if we'll be back but it was sure delightful. Ê it seemed to be the only asian fusion option in n. beach.

great service, kind and efficient. i wish the house was bigger though cuz it took a while to get seat with our reservation of 7 and the environment was limited for walking. i loved the appetizers. fresh and crispy, full of flavor. i think i had the calamari. their dishes are well decorated and i was definitely full afterwards. i had the fish dish, but i can eat appetizers all day long lol.

I generally stay away from trendy North Beach restaurants (I enjoy the old school Italian NB restaurants) Êbut my girlfriend wanted to try this one out due to good reviews on yelp. I'd say the food was pretty good, but nothing I'd particularly recommend to anyone, and on par with just about any upscale Asian fusion in the city. Generally, almost every dish was sweet from the sauces to dressings, and thus the meal was a bit unbalanced. Specifically, the liver was bland, the tuna tartar good (bar crudo much better), the pork belly was very good, the dumplings had no taste in my opinion but my girlfriend liked them a lot, the steak was fair at best, and no more than 1/2 step above what you might cook for yourself from Safeway cuts. I found the servers to be polite, but a bit inattentive in pouring water. I did not have to wait and was immediately seated per my reservation. I did not find it too loud as others commented. At a lower price point, I'd recommend as a decent place for lunch, but probably wouldn't have dinner there again.

Ate here last night with a friend. ÊIt's very small, cozy. ÊDetractions: thought that the house music was too loud for such a small place. ÊService was pretty good. ÊWe had to ask for our beers, which arrived after our appetizers and our server cleared a plate lightening fast without asking if we were done, which we weren't. Ê It was hard to pick out what we wanted because there were so many amazing looking dishes to choose from. ÊWe started with a beautiful butter leaf lettuce salad with huge golden raisins, avacado, and blue cheese. ÊIt was dressed perfectly. ÊFlavors were balanced and popped in your mouth. ÊI could have just eaten 3 plates of the salad and been very happy. ÊNext, we shared the white shrimp and chive dumplings, which were very tasty- shrimp was plump and flavorful. ÊCame with a lovely soy / vinegar dipping sauce. ÊI used very little of the sauce cause the dumplings were so tasty by themselves. ÊFor main course my friend and I shared the seared ahi- 3 generous pieces that were cooked perfectly. ÊIt came with a mustard cream sauce which was so different and delicious. Ê The presentation was stunning. ÊThe fish was fresh and flavorful but had too much connective tissue. ÊWe ordered the asparagus, which was fresh and very good. ÊThey serve beer and wine only. ÊLot's of nice offereings. ÊWe ordered a red rice beer, which we loved. ÊI live in the Bay Area and eat a lot of Asian fusion. ÊThis place is different. ÊNice combinations of Calfornia fare and Chinese food. ÊLight but Êvery flavorful and satisfying. ÊFor what you get the prices are reasonable. ÊI would defininitely go back.

overall is above average. Êthe pork chop and the sauce are so good, the meat is so tender. Êsea bass is over rating, is good but not as good as i think. Êfor the Ceasar salad with scallops, it just regular salad to me. Êbecause i am an asian, it's asian fusion food. i may have a higher expectation. Ê the fish Êjust ok to me, nothing suprise.

Êit's always packed but i have never seen a server have an attitude. Êi just love this place. Êrecommendations: Êblue lake beans tempura, black cod, unagi app., sea bass.
