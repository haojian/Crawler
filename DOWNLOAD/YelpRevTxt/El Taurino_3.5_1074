You know a place is good when there are only Koreans and Mexican people around in the early morning.  Okay, there were probably people of other races like White, Black, and Chinese, but Koreans and Mexicans were the majority.   There was a huge crowd and almost every table was taken.  Crazy! After I ate my tostada I understood.  I had a carne tostada. There was beans, and great quality carne and queso on top.  I topped it off with the verde salsa.  This was perfect I can't wait to go back.  My other three friends both loved their burritos and tostadas also.   El Taurino!! You are a hidden gem of Mexican food goodness!!!!!

I am from San Diego, home of the best Mexican food in the world (basically).. and l had really high hopes when I saw this place had over 1000 reviews and 4/5 stars. I am disappointed. I ordered an Al Pastor Taco and a Carne Asada burrito with everything in it. I couldn't even tell where the burrito was (because it was so small). But, I still had hopes. I thought to myself.. it must be the flavor. One bite into the burrito and I realized.. this doesn't really have anything in it... And, it isn't going to give me the San Diego experience of a burrito. (darn). The taco was pretty good! I don't know what the hype is about...this isn't good mexican food. There's no sauce bar or pico de gallo in the burrito. It's not disgusting but, I would probably choose another place the next time I have a mexican food craving.

When I lived in Los Angeles, I was a regular here. I love the fact that they actually make their Horchata and pineapple juice and don't use a machine syrup mixer like other places. The Al Pastor and Carne tacos are the best. As for the constant debate on which place is better "King Taco" or "El Taurino" its just a matter of locational preference. If you do not know, they are owned by the same family. So they are very similar in food quality. Avoid this place during Friday and Saturday nights like the plague! Unless you want to deal with tons of drunk loud clubbers... (sorry no offense if you are one of the those masses lol) I just really hate long lines. The red hot sauce is super hot. I only get the salsa verde (green sauce) on my tacos. I miss this place already. But "Taco el Gordo" will do for me now in Las Vegas. :)

$6 FOR A BURRITO DE PURA CARNE ASADA?!?! And it's literally the size of a McDonald's breakfast burrito! LOL WUT?! What the hell El Taurino? Dammit you've gotten too big for your own good. That is way too much to charge. Also you're charging for extra salsa now? WTH?! now I have to make an effort to flirt with the guys behind the counter so they can slip me some extra salsa verde. Why El Taurino?? My family has been going to you since the 80's... I remember coming to this place as a little girl. Back then it seemed like only Latinos knew about it and the burritos were cheap and bigger than your head. But I'm all for sharing so why not let the rest of the world experience El Taurino... Except now I get kinda sad when I visit. The waits are way too long, it's gotten too popular, and the large latino families that used to visit have been replaced by hipsters and rich college kids from USC. I'm not a fan of their tacos, red salsa, or Al Pastor. My order will always be un burrito de pura carne asada (all beef carne asada burrito) salsa verde (green salsa) agua de pina (pineapple drink) If the carne asada wasn't soo damn good, this place would get 1 star. lol

El Taurino.... the story of our love hate relationship. Best: red. effing. sauce. this sauce is pretty much what holds our relationship together. Everything is good but this sauce is great. I sometimes straight up buy a little container (yes you can buy it separately, they have varying sizes) and take it home to take my other favorite burritos or even chipotle to the NEXT LEVEL@!@@@@. be warned though this sauce is spicy. if i eat here for a while my face excretes some kind of liquid but whether they are tears or snot or excess saliva they are always of joy :] green sauce is also very delicious but sadly overshadowed just like mario and luigi. Good: really good tacos, all meat burritos, sopes, tortas, tostadas, nachos, horchata all made exponentially better by red elixir of latino spice. even the horchata, cuz that red sauce burns and horchata relieves so well making it better than it would be without the sauce. the meat/cilantro/onion mix is soo good, very juicy and limey and delicious. Bad: service. lines get frustratingly long. and the wait gets even more frustrating. It takes a LOONGGGG time to get your food during the popping late night hours and every time i tell myself i am never coming back here again. AND the workers know i want that sauce and they always are such a TEASE!!! they get stingy with it, and they are always more stingy and grumpy towards non-spanish speakers...but i get my food and all of that anger disappears... strangely... every single time.. and there it is our love hate relationship. Bonus: honestly people watching here is extremely fun, come late night this place is full of people that are just straight up entertaining to look at. That might be mean, but regulars will understand hahahahaha. King Taco tastes pretty much the same and has way better wait time and seating but honestly its BORING el taurino is where its at. Also, great, free parking ^^ They have a food truck in the parking lot you can order from, orders come out much faster but its cash only and you have to eat in your car. Tip: the napkins you get with your food are all you get so ask for more before! P.S. i feel like most of the people only dabble in the mysteries of el taurino. The pro latino families never order what we order they get like some soup and plate of what looks like whole short ribs.. its like the other side of el taurino that no asian ever dares to approach

The tacos al pastor are great, almost as good as King Taco, but for the love of all things that are holy, DO NOT ORDER INSIDE after midnight on a Friday or Saturday night. They take FOREVER to make your order so you're much, much better off ordering from the taco truck outside. It's cash only though so plan accordingly. Also, the taco truck will occasionally run out of certain things (they didn't have horchata once, which is a basic food group on the Mexican food pyramid) so keep that in mind. However, if you have all the time in the world and love watching drunk people try to eat, then by all means, sit inside and knock yourself out. I'd much rather go to King Taco on 3rd Street but this is a legit spot to fulfill your late-night taco cravings if you're in the area.

Aside from feeling like you're going to get mugged because they have not one but two armed guards in the parking lot, this place is pretty delicious! I pretty much felt like I was risking my life coming here alone, so I am going to rave about it because it was super yummy. They have a parking lot which helps because there are security in the parking lot. I would not park elsewhere, the surrounding streets are a little sketchy. Once you walk in, there's two areas for ordering, usually only one is open so you go towards the end to order. The tacos are cheap, and they're pretty authentically sized because they were tiny. I ordered my usual lengua and carne asada and they came up pretty quickly. They have great salsa, but apparently they're stingy with it. I thought it was fine, since I had two little containers for my three tacos (yes I got greedy!) I loved the meat since it was super flavorful, and it was the perfect little succulent bite of yummy all wrapped up in some grilled tortillas. To that I say YES.

College kids and Koreans (some of my favorite people), what the hellz are you thinking? This is place is 1) dirty 2) not even good mexican food 3) has horrible service 4) could get you SHOT!! (with a real gun!) Totally not worth it. My friend got nachos which basically was a giant plate of cheese whiz but was pictured with other stuff on it. When she asked for jalepenos, they dumped an entire cup of PICKLED jalepenos and veggies (juices and all) on herr plate. Icky, icky poo. My tacos al pastor were gnarly. No likey!!! Stay away! Many other late night and WAY more scrumptious mexican places!!! Wait, did I mention YOU COULD GET SHOT!?!?!??!

Since there are over 1000 reviews, I am not gonna add the same thing.  But don't get pork taco. The pork meat has this distinctive taste and smell that bother me a lot. Not pleasant.  As a Korean, I don't think other fellow Korean ladies would like pork taco either.  Trust ladies. Compared to their orgasmic all meat burrito, port taco is so disappointing. There's something wrong with the way they season pork .  I am a huge fan of all meat burrito and chicken tamales. Yum Yum

If you are hung over and/or want some bomb Mexican food past midnight (at the expense of ruining your new year's resolution diet plan), this place should be one of your top places to get your grub on. Just have a conversation with a regular El Taurino-goer about the red sauce you'll know what I'm talking about. They have a variety of typical Mexican food (i.e. tostadas, sopes, tortas, tacos, burritos, etc) but it's their crack-sauce that defines this place as one of the best Mexican food restaurants around ktown. I personally enjoy a combination of one all-meat burrito with a few al pastor tacos, and most importantly, the red sauce. The prices are reasonable, but the wait can be excruciating and thus I'm giving 4/5 stars. I highly recommend you stay away from this place during normal lunch/dinner hours--especially Sundays! They do have a taco truck parked adjacent to the building (at the parking lot), where you can buy food as well for cash only.

Interestingly enough, I always recommend this place to people for late night Mexican food, but they don't really have anything that I love. I will give El Taurino credit, they make a damn good Torta. My favorite thing on their menu is their Carne Asada Torta. I know it seems counterintuitive but what I like about it is that they have a reasonable portion of meat. You get a great balance of meat, veggies, bread, and that crumble of queso. Unfortunately, my Mexican food hierarchy goes like this: Quesadilla, burrito, tamale, sope, taco, torta. I know there's more but I'm just throwing out the handhelds that I can easily name off the top of my head. Their quesadillas are not bad, but aren't incredible either. They tend not to be filled to the edge with cheese so the outsides always are kind of empty. It's also pretty greasy. The burritos are good, but usually don't have enough meat in them for my taste. Tacos are pretty small for the price you're getting. I think all the meat I've had at El Taurino has been tasty. Also, their green salsa really does blow my mind. It's both clean tasting and a slight kick in the teeth. Just awesome. But outside of the torta, there's not much else that really blows my mind. Still, it's a good place to hit after a concert, basketball game, etc. Always seems to be the right choice, I'm never unsatisfied.

The El Taurino late-night taco truck is GREAT. Out drinking at hungry at one in the morning? El Taurino taco truck. Studying and want another excuse to procrastinate? El Taurino taco truck. Want to feel your mouth burn from the hot sauce? El Taurino taco truck. Seriously. I loved it while I was in LA and all I've had was the Carne Asada tacos. (dos, por favor). The hot sauce (the super spicy one - the red one?) was great for me - just right. My companion, though, was sweating and seemed to be in legitimate pain as he saturated and scarfed down his taco with the sauce. "Why put so much sauce on it?" I asked him. "It's how you eat it. I love the burn." What a masochist.

Best mexican food ever. I basically got the menu sampler with my friend which consisted of tostadas, sopes, tortas, tacos, and a burrito. I've been to several other "famous" spots in LA but nothing hits the spot like this one. Do yourself a favor and when you visit LA, go to El Taurino. Contrary to popular belief, it tastes just as good during the day. If you don't know, now you know.

El taurino is one of the best Mexican spot I've ever been. This place is small but always full meaning the food is super good.

If I ordered these tacos at a random food truck (or at the truck they have in the back), I would probably think these are awesome tacos. But I think the line and the wait set us all up for high expectations that lead us to unwillingly be disappointed with the food. It's good, and the wait wasn't unbearable when we went. It's just not mind-blowingly outstanding. It's simply solid, 3-star, A-okay food. Again, if I had these at an unpretentious little taco truck and didn't have to wait in such a crowded restaurant to order/eat, I would think these are great. Next time, I'll skip the lines and just go straight to their truck out back. On another note, this place is teeming with Koreans from the motherland. ... Brace yourselves for a shock.

Some people swear by this place but for someone that lives in the area, its meh. I mean, their red sauce is flaming hot and their food is good, and its great that its open all the time, but its really not worth waiting an hour for your food. Also, they have become more and more stingy with the portions over the years. However, if you are visiting LA for the first time, this place is an institution that you must visit right after you drink before you sleep.

Absolute best thing about this place is the sauce. It's REALLY spicy but you can't stop eating it. A lot of people don't enjoy this place because of the long lines and long wait time for your food to come out but I don't care it is worth it.

This is my favorite place to grab a burrito and some tacos late at night when I'm in LA. That being said, I absolutely HATE the way this place is run. The ordering process is confusing and inefficient, with multiple steps required and the world's worst PA system to explain it all. Whoever runs this place is an idiot (for managing it so poorly) and a genius (for keeping things so pure). PROS - Hands down, the tastiest taqueria around - Open at all hours - Reasonably priced CONS - Horribly confusing ordering system with multiple windows and a PA system that makes it impossible to hear what's going on. - Dining room is almost always dirty with used trays and food wrappers TIPS - El Taurino uses the same hot sauce as King Taco. It's basically the same thing just smaller and faster.

Okay, first off, this place must be a sister store to King Taco because their sauces are identical. There are however a few differences. I love the fact that they offer "plates" in addition to the traditional taco, burrito or sope. Here's what I mean. Usually when you order a burrito or taco, it comes wrapped in tortilla, however, you also have the option of of getting just the meat on a plate with guacamole, rice and beans on the side. This makes it easy for me to eat "paleo."  Also, something worth mentioning is the "Costillas rancheras." It's a thin, bone-in steak served with grilled onions. It also comes with guacamole and beans on the side. The meat is tender and well seasoned and of course comes with a signature red or green salsa. Decor-wise, it's definitely a dive.  It's a bull fighter themed restaurant and has a lotta random posters and paraphernalia of bull fights.  Did I mention the bull head on the back wall?  Kinda cool to stare your meat in the face. :) there are numerous tables but during the lunch, dinner or late night rush, it's extremely hard to find a table, let alone a clean table. Otherwise, there is usually ample parking, security and even a jukebox inside. I'd recommend this place for delicious Mexican food, as long as you can get over the fact that its a dive.

Food: 4 Wait: 2.5 El Taurino on Saturday at 3am in a nut shell: Stuffy and full of drunk, belligerent people. I've heard good things but didn't expect the wait to be this long. Sure the tostada and tacos were pretty damn good (the tostada+green sauce in particular) but we waited over an hour (for just my order) while watching drunk people yell at the poor workers behind the counter. Really guys? Seeing that El Taurino is open 24 hours, I'll try to come at a more normal meal hour. I'm hypothesizing that the wait won't be this ridiculous&the people will be much more sober.

SERVICE: -When you walk into the restaurant it is easy to get confused. The place is huge. You order your food on either the left or right side and then they call your # and you go to one of the windows. The girl took my order and I asked for a side of jalapenos and for red and green sauce. When my order came up the guy asked me what sauce I wanted and I said both. He replied, "NO, you only get one." WHAT THE F...I said I would willingly pay for another sauce which costs $0.60, but by that time the line was super long. FOOD: -CARNE ASADA, PASTOR, & CARNITAS TACOS - All delicious. The meat is really flavorful and each taco comes with two tortillas. My only gripe with this place is that the tacos don't come with any sauce on them. ANDDD you only get the choice of one sauce which comes in the tiniest container ever. Also the jalapenos that I asked for that she charged me $0.60 for came in the same small ass container that only fit 2 slices.

So we've been going to this place for a while, I can't even remember the first time I went. I have to say, lately, this place hasn't really been the go-to spot, especially with all the other delicious taco trucks around town. But we really wanted a quick bite so we decided to make a quick stop on Sunday night. Alrite, it was like 5pm on sunday night, I understand they are beginning to have their dinner rush, but seriously it took us 40 minutes to get our 8 tacos. FOUR-ZERO. 4-0... You know we aren't really the type of people to complain, so we just kept sitting there, but the frustration was definitely brewing... We were quite hungry too... so 40 minutes pass, and we reluctantly receive our tacos. We sat quietly for 10 minutes throwing down the tacos. Not a word spoken to each other. Damn the tacos were good... Damn... worth waiting 40 minutes? probably wouldn't do it again, but did it make waiting 40 minutes all better? Definitely yes... That was the most frustrating part, that we couldn't even be mad at this place for making us wait all that time because of their DAMN TACOS... Everyone knows, they have the bomb-diggity salsa roja and verde. The roja is spicy on another level, so be aware. It's that type of spiciness that forces you to throw down more sauce just to prolong the damage until you are done. Don't say I didn't warn you. Few things: the tacos are tiny. I could def throw down 5 minimum no problem. Carne asada? its whatevers... I think their best is in their carnitas, pastor, and barbacoa. Burritos are really good... I particularly like their tortillas for some reason, it has a nice softness to it. Go when its not too crowded, and have a few tacos with the sauce to have the best el taurino experience.

my coworker raves about this place, and i can see why.  its pretty good... i've only come before going to the club... but i can see this place populated after the clubs.   beef squid and the beef tongue were both interesting and excellent choices. the al pastor is always a good choice.  actually... there's so many choices its hard just to pick one.  i hate being indecisive!  [[I used to think I was indecisive, but now I'm not so sure.]]  lol. if you're still undecided on what to get.  get a beef tongue burrito, carne asada torta and an al pastor sopes.  trust.  and cover it up with red or green sauce.  the more sauce the better! parking is a bitch at times.  they actually have a guard in the parking lot directing traffic and watching over our cars.  he's like the guardian angel to our cars.  bless you. you can also order out in the back, but its only cash only back there. you can use a CC inside.

When I first started coming here there were several workers on the line assembling tacos and burritos in an exceedingly efficient manner.  A separate trio of workers made the tortas and yet another team hacked the barbacoa into pieces with a cleaver.  It would have been rare to wait five minutes to have them complete your order, even at peak times.   Well, I understand that everybody needs to make a buck and so they had to down size, but the last time I came in here I waited 40 minutes to get an order of fucking red sauce (4oz/$1.50).  The place was not really crowded, either, and it was around 10:30AM.  The two remaining women that are working the line are quite efficient, it is not their fault.  It is the fault of the management team over at King Taco for making costs as low as possible while giving the consumer the shittiest service fathomable without making them walk out.  It is a fine line indeed.  I called the 800 customer service line, and they seemed completely un-interested in my opinion and my comments.  If I were working a complaint line, I wouldn't give a fuck either so we have an understanding there.   While I do like the red sauce here I will not be returning to this place.

4 stars, only because the one big gripe about the entire King Taco family of restaurants and chains: The lines... I wish they had a better PA system (truly some comic can make fun of their system with the muffled noises) and making sure you can wait anywhere between 30 minutes to almost an hour for food.   Parking is OK, but can be cramped when they use the taco truck to buffer the lines within the restaurant.   Oh and also, if you're one of those people (including my fellow Korean folks)  that asks  for more than their fair share of sauces for only two taco's, just buy the god damn Salsa Grande, it costs about the same as a taco, but you'll have like 5x more sauce than you'll ever ask. King taco serves it up in bigger cups!

As I click the 5 star rating.. It says on the side "As good as it gets!" and this place is seriously.. as good as it gets. I am actually pretty shocked that I haven't reviewed this place yet as I am an avid regular and hardcore promoter for the BEST tacos you can get in Los Angeles. If you like King Taco, you are going to LOVE el taurino. They are from the same company, but there's something about el taurino that I love more. It's probably the fact that when I start getting my taco cravings at 2AM in the morning.. I can count on them to be open and count on them to serve my perfectly tender and juicy carne asada tacos. I have had around half of the entire menu and seriously.. EVERYTHING is a 5/5. My favorite however are definitely the tacos an tortas. Tacos: Juicy and tender meat. The problem I have with many other taco places is that the meat is dry and not flavorful enough. The tortilla they have underneath is perfection. Some places make them too thick causing the inside to be dryer and more flaky.. some others get soggy with the meat & sauce.. but El Taurinos is the BEST consistency. Tortas: Omggg.. the bread they use first is delicious. It's toasted so the edges are crunch but the inside is just a little sweet and perfect. Meat is amazing like usual & the veggies are always vibrant and fresh. They don't cheap out on the avacados either (usually 4-5 slices). Amazing... Con: If you want water you have to buy bottled water.. but it's not enough for me to stop coming back.

Great meat selection here, they offer some weird stuff that not even the person at the counter could tell me what it was or part of the cow it came from. This is an LA landmark, but to me it's lost it's status because they have become very stingy with portions and even with the salsa. I wanted an extra green salsa last time I came here and they charge me 40 cents. Tacos are $1.25 but if you consider the extra 40 cents for salsa that's $2 and in LA there many other great taquerias where you can buy a taco for $1 and have all the salsa you want.

Love these Tacos! Ordering: Go up to registers to order and they'll give your order number & when they call it also listen for the window number were you'll pick up your food and take it back to your table. You can also place orders over the phone to be picked up. Place/ food: Tacos are really good, the carne asada burrito is all meat and delicious and the red salsa is HOT! & oh so good! Place is big and maintained clean, also has plenty of seating. If you're here with a group of people I suggest you send one person on the hunt for a table; they can get pretty busy and crowded. Parking: There's street parking and behind them there's a free parking lot with plenty of spaces. Enjoy!

Came here for lunch on the weekend at the prime lunch hour. Because of the weekend and lunch time, we ended up waiting about 40 minutes for our order of 8 tacos ($1.25/taco). The meats we tried for the tacos were: carne asada, pollo, carnitas and al pastor. My fave was the chicken which was shredded, tender and juicy. The other meats were tender and well marinated as well, but I preferred the chicken. The salsa verde was delicious...not too mildly spicy and great on top of the tacos with freshly sliced onions and parsley. We got an extra plate of the onions and parsley for free so that was nice. The only thing I miss are free chips and salsa to nibble on while you're waiting for your food. There is a free parking lot with a security guard inside. Would definitely come back...just not during the peak eating times.

Um. So there was an explosion of deliciousness in my mouth. What in the world did I just eat? Came here with high expectations because so many of my friends RAVE about this place! After seeing SO many Facebook mobile pictures of this place, I knew I just had to come here and try it out. And I'd have to say, El Taurino exceeded my expectations. I got the pollo tostada and 4 carne asada tacos. The tacos may seem very small but these bad boys are actually pretty filling! And... so... very.... good.... I enjoyed the tacos a lot more than the tostada, but that's just my opinion. If you're a sucker for spicy food, get the red spicy sauce! Goes so well with the tacos! And if you can, get that creamy sour cream sauce! For some reason, the girl who was handing out our food behind the counter was mean. She gave my boyfriend a dirty look when he asked for extra hot sauce and she glared at me when I asked for the sour cream sauce.. and she just said "it costs extra." That was rude. But despite her rudeness, I still give this place 5 stars. The deliciousness of the tacos definitely outshone the customer service. The restaurant has its own private parking lot. It's kinda small and can get kinda hectic when there are a lot of people. If I can describe the food here in one word: DAAAAANK!

It's a nice place to eat (like how the it says on the sign outside). But not on Friday and Saturday nights. Trust me, unless you enjoy waiting an hour or more. Another warning, although it doesn't seem crowded, there is a minimum 15 minute wait. Two major downsides, negatives, cons, my only wishes, a prayer request: 1. Efficiency. Maybe we can advise them about what Henry Ford did and make some sort of assembly line to speed up the ordering. Even when it's not busy, I stand in front of my window and I patiently wait. I say nothing in fear that they will take another 10 minutes... 2. Quantity. I've been reading other reviews and yes they are correct. I thought Korean service was bad, but here it can be about the same. I got a rude glare and a comment in Spanish when asked for extra napkins. They charge for limes (0.27 with tax) and I didn't even bother asking for extra sauce. I observed my taco artist (astonishingly, who is also my cashier) and it seemed like she purposely took her time. Got the tortilla, went in the back to get some ingredients, put the asada on my taco, went in the back to get something again, casually converse with a coworker in Spanish, and put the onions and cilantro. This whole process again repeated for my tostada and then my torta! I patiently waited. I waited with my mouth closed. If I complained, I would have been cursed out and be banished from this historic Los Angeles landmark. Tacos - $1.25 Small but packed a lot of punch accompanied with red sauce. Torta - $4.75 Toasted bread with butter, refried beans, sour cream, onions, choice of meat, one slice of tomato, white cheese, and a few pieces of avocado. Wonderful combination of flavor between two slices of bread. Tostada - $3.49 A crispy foundation with a spread of refried beans and on top are toppings that will bring you to another level. Go with the customer favorite, asada. Came with pickeled onions, avocado,a slice of tomato, slice of avocado, Mexican sour cream, and sprinkles of cheese. Red Sauce -  Darkish red in color and a drop may instantaneously overwhelm your taste buds. It's a sauce no other place can replicate (except King Taco, read on). Green Sauce - Milder but still a lot of heat. Has seeds, diced onions, and cilantro. A good sidekick to the red sauce.   Limes - $0.27 with tax. Yes, they do charge for limes... There a lot of comparisons between El Taurino and King Taco. They are the same (minus the service and quantity).  I saw a King Taco supply truck roll in the back. So with that eyewitness encounter, I came to the conclusion that King Taco is the vendor thus resulting the same taste with sauces and meat. I am a fan, and always will be. I will continue to smile and let the employees see how much of a good mood I'm in. With a little ounce of hope, my intention is that it may rub off. Just a bit...

3 things you need to know: 1. This is THE bestest place to go to for late night tacos after a night out in LA. Their tacos are small, but filled with lots of meat and onions and cilantro! For $1.25, you're getting a good amount of food, and tasty at that! The carne asada is DEFINITELY hands down my favorite. The al pastor and lengua are good as well. 2. The salsa roja is deathly spicy (coming from someone whose ketchup is called sriracha), but absolutely necessary to put in your taco. Get it on the side and pour it droplet by droplet. Get a horchata to appease the heat. 3. Be prepared to wait. I don't think I've waited less than 30 minutes between the hours of 10-2AM. Hopefully you came with your loud, rowdy friends so you can all complain about the wait together while still semi buzzed from the night. But trust, it's worth it.

Ok, this place used to be really good, however, it's not that good anymore.  It's not freshly made, and it takes forever!  It look an hour to get 5 tacos and 1 burrito, and it wasn't fresh!!  Seriously, what took so long if it's not even fresh?  There are soo many workers too. Everyone knows of this place and everyone likes this place, but the food really isn't that great anymore.  The last 3-4 times that I've been in here the course of a year, I didn't really think it was that special.  The green sauce is pretty good, I just don't think this place is worth the wait.

Twelve years ago, I would've probably rated this joint four or five stars. But we're in 2012, and whether or not the world is ending this year, I will NOT come here again. Even with rising prices, portions have significantly decreased. The quality of meat has gone from above average to mediocre. I mean, the burritos are like the size of my hands. And no, it's not that my hands are that small or big.. It's just the indication that the owner is getting greedy. I will give El Taurino one star for their hot sauces for it is quite unique in comparison to other joints. But I have to take half a star away from their only star because they only allow one complimentary baby spoon of hot sauce and nothing else. On top of that, they don't even give complimentary water. The other half star will be given for operating for long periods of time so that it is readily available. I'll never understand why so many people give these ridiculous 5 star ratings. Whether if it tastes good when you're intoxicated, don't write a review when you're intoxicated either. Don't waste your time and money on this over-priced crap. Instead, go to Tacos Leo or Juanita's where you're surely not to be ripped off for better authentic Mexican food.

I just drove 20+ hours from Dallas to Los Angeles. I was exhausted and in bed, ready to pass out.... but somehow I started to think about El Taurino... and that was the end of that. I got out of bed and drove up there, dodged all the drunk people and ordered myself a taco, a sope, and a burrito. There was a little wait, but not too bad. The taco was pretty good, but I've had better (particularly in Dallas at Fina Gas Station). The sope and burrito... it's not possible for it to be more delicious. It's so good that I have to continually tell myself to slow down while I'm eating. Some people prefer the salsa verde (green), but I loooooooove the spicier red. My only complaint about El Taurino is that they're super shiesty about their sauce. In the past, I've had to get back in line and order more food just to get more. I know that tomorrow morning, I might regret eating all this at 1AM... but for right now, I can't stop smiling. So much for my diet...

Asada or bust! Must-haves: Carne-Asada Taco's [B+] Skip: Everything else. Decided to go off a recommendation from Steve C. He raved about the carne asada and we had a little bit of time before the USC vs. UCLA MBA beer pong tourny started, so we thought we'd pre-fiesta a little bit. I got a variety of different meats and types of food but only one stood strong: the carne asada. VERY impressed with how much flavor this carne asada had. They should prepare every meat option here similar to the carne asada. Here are some quick details on the other things I ordered Torta: Mayo and poor quality bread way too high Al Pastor: A little bland Lengua: Nothing special, bland. And soda lovers...El Tourino serves pepsi =( My only regret was that I only got 1 carne asada taco! So heed my advice, don't waste your time with anything else. The carne asada is the best thing here. Get something that let's the asada shine like a burrito or taco and you will be very happy. Also: Bad parking, long lines and very crowded Food: C- | Service: C | Selection: C+ | Experience: C | Overall:  C

24/7 Called them after king taco was closed and found out they never close! 3 am in the morning and place full of people trying to sober up or getting a bite after the club. Got a burrito and 3 tacos. As usual the taste of both were great. I should've gotten more tacos and skipped the burrito because the tacos had a good amount of meat but the burrito was real skinny.

I've been coming to this place since I was a kid. My Pops would bring me here sometimes after work or on his day off. I remember the smell would start to penetrate the car on Hoover  when we were going downhill. All that good Al Pastor, Asada and Carnitas. Oh and that the core of the place is not for the faint of heart. Maybe for my dad it was a little more nostalgic because he was a bullfighter. So if you're from Los Angeles and have never been here or you're just visiting it is a must eat. Tacos,burritos pretty much anything on the menu is fantastic. I bring my son here now and I know Pops is always riding along with us. I love you Pops and thank you for so much until we meet again:)

Food is okay, you'll prolly have a tastier taco or burrito for the same price off a taco truck, and you'll prolly get it within 15mins off a taco truck. This place gets confusing, you order, they give you a number, you wait at 1 of the 3 windows (not even sure if it's 2 or 3 windows) the wait is somewhere around 30-40mins which is horrible especially for ppl who have been drinking all night, the food was okay, al pastor and carne asada (if your from the valley you've had better, trust!) But what got me was, when they call your number that's when they start making your food. Like wtf!! Overall a taco truck experience is better, but if you cant stand and need to sit 30-40mins before you eat. This could be your dream place.

The taco trucks in K-town are much better than El Taurino, IMO. It's not a quick stop, since there's always a line- expect to wait about 20 min from entry to exit. There's a parking lot in the back. PLUS: Cheap. The people who work there are nice. The red sauce. MINUS: I don't like their burrito tortilla. Tasted cheap and dry. But that's what you pay for.

Love everything about El Taurino. This is the place to be after a night out. Taco's, burritos, sope's, tostadas...everything is good. My choice-Carne asada sope + Red Sauce! AMAZING!

This place is a little slice of  taco heaven!  One night I was really wanting a torta, and I came to yelp and searched.  This was the first place that came up and based on the positive reviews, I went for it.  Make no mistake about it, this place is tasty, and it now has a spot in grease filled heart.  I grabbed two al pastor tacos and a torta Cubana.  Both did not disappoint. The al pastor was good, the torta Cubana was insanely delicious.  Also that red salsa is just as good, dare I say better than King Taco's red salsa.  Now I think King Taco owns this place but El Taurino has been in LA since the 70's.  That being said, their menu offers more than the King Taco one.  I'm am for sure going back to this place, to try something new or just that torta Cubana. Oh this place is pretty popular so prepare to wait in line and wait for your food.

Yeah, 5 stars! Freaking LOVE this place. I have been coming here for years. Every time my dad would piss my mom off, he would bring us here to make it up to her! He'll then get drunk and get her mad again. You know what that means right? MORE TAURINO! I'm a fan of their Carne Asada anything! Meaning, anything carne Asada is delicious. Yummy cilantro and onions, spicy red sauce that kicks in during and after the meal, juicy green sauce to keep your mouth from incineration. The horchata is so good, I finish it before I get my meal. =( it's a love/hate relationship. Damn your deliciousness horchata! I usually order to go, but if you decide to stay and eat in, you're definitely going to enjoy the decor. Very Spanish! The lines can be long. They might lag a bit on putting out your order, but rest assured that when you're number is called, you'll be one happy sun of a gun! *George Zimmer voice* I guarantee it!

Sorry, but the legendary el taurino falls flat on its face when trying to live up to the hype. There's no doubt el taurino is the go to spot for Asians (post club/bars on weekends), Hispanics, and Mexican food afficianados alike, but for no damn reason! Granted, they got an addictive red hot sauce that I promise will burn and numb your tastebuds for the entirety of your meal, which might be why everyone claims to love this spot. Let's face it, if you are trashed drunk, any food you stuff yourself with tastes amazing. Oh ps. brilliant planning for raking in that moola (which i have to respect)- the spot famous mostly for its deathly hot addictive sauce offers no free water, only purchaseable bottles or horchata (which is pretty good). Taurino has definitely become ingrained as THE post going out, grubbing hotspot in ktown and will def keep that title for a while. El Taurino is like the McD's of late night grub spots in ktown. it's alright but never worth the long 2-3 am lines of drunk people you have to stand behind for. Doesn't matter tho, I follow my friends, and as long as their 2 am drunk cravings lead us here, I will continue eating their food, blandness numbed out by that ridiculous red sauce. lol

I live 3 blocks away from this place. This place and I have a love n hate relationship. The food is delicious, but their service is sooooooo damn freakin' slow!! My advice for the best times to go? Early in the morning. I'm talkin' about from the moment they open till only about 2 hours later.  If you like lots of their red sauce, I recommend you buy extra sauce while you order because they're stingy with everything from the portions of meat, to the portions of sauce. DO NOT GO DURING PEAK HOURS OR LATE NIGHT unless you're with a lot of friends and don't mind waiting over 30 minutes for your food. I waited almost an hour once because they're so damn slow. If you look at their workers, they're all fat and do not hustle AT ALL. None of them give 2 s**ts about the customer, work at their own pace and their restroom is nasty.

El Taurino is pretty much an LA institution at this point. I mean, who doesn't come here for late night grub to satisfy the munchies and drunchies? While the flavor of the food is awesome and the prices as cheap as any other taqueria or taco truck, I do feel that they are very stingy here. Not only with the hot sauces and garnishes as many people have mentioned, but also with the portions. Portions seem to be very inconsistent as well, most importantly; while the tortas and burrito are pretty substantial, the tacos are tiny and barely contain a few ounces of meat. So there you go, stick with the tortas and burritos and skip the tacos. Definitely skip the nachos. My friend's carne asada nachos was so fucking tiny and lacking in ingredients it was pitiful. It was literally a small pile of store bought tortilla chips drizzled with what seemed like artificial queso sauce, and sprinkled with tiny cubes of carne asada. For $5, you could really do so much better at other Mexican joints... As much as I like coming here after a long night out, I highly doubt I would consciously eat here when the sun is still out. Or when I'm sober.

When I asked some native LA-ers what the one thing I should have in LA was, they said I had to try the tostadas here. My mind was blown. Now I may be biased because I was in LA for a very short time and wasn't able to try out any of the other famed Mexican establishments, but this place spoke truth to my taste buds. SO good. Carne asada tostada.............. I still dream about you. Pair that with a horchata, and DAYUM. My grandma called me when I was done to see when I was coming back to her place where I was staying. She asked if I was bringing back any leftovers. HA! Leftovers. I told her the wait was long, but she still wanted me to bring some back. Little 85-year-old Korean lady loves this stuff, too.

Handkerchief?? Check. Backup handkerchief??  Double check. Pen and paper??  Wtf?!  Who does that anymore, just write the damn review!!! Ok, alright, ok. . . Very few place can make me salivate just by thinking of it and El Taurino definitely makes the list!!!  OoooOoOOoooOo interesting list idea anyone?!?! My family has been going to El Taurino since they started out as a traveling taco truck (aawww my parents dating chasing taco trucks).  The tacos are amazing!!!  Great selection from the stables carne asada, pollo to lengua (beef tongue).  We stick to 4-5 orders of carne asada tacos per person :-) You order in one or two lines and they will direct you to another window where your food will be prepared.  As your number comes up, they'll ask what you want on it.  EVERYTHING - onions, cilantro and the red salsa.  This red salsa is the very reason I am salivating right now.  Handkerchief number one used. It definitely has a kick, the uncanny ability to make all of my facial orifices ooze with liquid.  I tear, I drool and I attractively have mucus coming out of my nose.  My tongue is on fire by taco number two but you just can't stop.  The salsa is not only hot but the actual flavor complements the meat, onions and cilantro nicely.  Bring out backup handkerchief!! They serve a variety of dishes from tacos to burritos to tortas to sopes but the tacos are where the money is at (for me).  Drinks available including cervesas.  I get their horchata with a side of ice to calm the flames. Drooooooooooool OVERLOAD!!!!  Forgive me but I must excuse myself now :-)

Its good for certain things but others are really disappointing. Like the stadium nachos. Fake cheese sauce and tortilla chips.... really? I'm sorry but these were not the Mexican nachos I've grown to love around town. The asada is really the only reason I come here. A carne asada burrito pura carne with jack cheese. Booom. And their green salsa is something else man - I could drink it out of the bottle. Final verdict: Pick and choose carefully, stick to the basics. Ultimately you know it's good when a late night place also tastes good sober.

Has been THE place to go late night. Try to avoid it  from 1-3 in the morning as the wait can get crazy. I only get their Carne Tostadas. Its so crispy and chewy and yummmy. I also get the taco when I feel like the tostadas are not enough. Its a perfect combo.. It's not a five star because the line to order takes foreverrr and the food takes forever. It's really annoying standing and waiting with my  4 inch heels and my feet are blistered up and throbbing. but I still come. tostadas, tostadas, tostadas

I used to love this place. I'm not sure if there's new management or what but I'm no longer impressed. I went last night and got the skimpiest burritos I've ever had. I used to get full of half a burrito from here. Now I barely get full off the whole burrito. Theres more tortilla than toppings. And the meat isn't as well seasoned and flavorful as it used to be. It's all around disappointing. The one saving grace was the chicken tamale which tasted great. However, it came wrapped in king taco paper... Maybe I should just go there next time.

Eh not sure what all the big hype is around El Taurino, I mean it's not bad or anything but it isn't anything to brag home about. Picked up several tacos and an order of carne asada nachos which almost took forever and a day but I can't really complain because my friends and I decided to go after a ball game. Orders were mainly called out in Spanish and barely audible most of the time, luckily few of us knew how to count in Spanish and helped the few others who didn't speak the language find their orders. Food finally came out and the portions seem fairly small and meager to what you can get from those Mexican roach coaches for the same price or less. Nachos were especially sparse lacking in what should usually come in nachos like: pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole, and beans; Just a very barebones carne asada and nacho cheese. Honestly it isn't worth the wait and severely lacking in portion size compared to most other taco places. Might as well drive around and look for a taco truck or find your local Alertos/Albertos.

This is the place to be for good late night tacos in dtla. Carne Asada (4/5) - Had good flavor, but the meat was a little dry. Al Pastor (5/5) - The meat was nice and soft and had a bold spicy and salty, but not too salty taste. Horchata (4/5) - Really refreshing, but the cinnamon in it was a little too strong. They don't have a salsa bar and they are really stingy with their sauces. Their red and green sauces were so awesome too and I wanted more. Just not pay more. I have said it before and I will say it again. Tacos are the best food to eat when you are drunk. I love to bar hop in dtla and this place would be great afterwards.

It's not about the customer service. You don't come to a place like this in an area like this for customer service. Understand? Good, at least we got that portion out of the way. The food is 5 stars as far as authenticity as to what real mexican food is all about. The prices are higher than you would expect. Yes there are armed security guard posted everywhere with pistols. The lines are long and their burritos are disappointingly small. Why go here? Because it's a true Los Angeles landmark that offers a fine taco or two. Try their tostada and tacos but do skip on the burrito.

My second visit here, three of us grabbed a snack: nachos con carne, and three tacos: carne asada, carnitas, pollo. The nachos were a disappointment because they used nacho cheese instead of real, shredded cheese. The tacos were all great though. Juicy, tender meat, and the salsas were spicy!

I'd like to make a TOST...ADA!!! Now introducing... TOS... TADA!!! Okay, I'll stop... Ambience: 4 Taste: 5 Bang for Buck: 3 Service: 3 Wow Factor: 5 Fatty Meter: 4 First of all, this is the correct address for El Taurino... The other listing with 100+ reviews has the wrong address on it so therefore, I am officially the 3rd reviewer. Ambience is nothing out of the ordinary.  There's many Mexican murals on the walls and a huge bull's head sticking out of every other wall. The taste is hands down untouchable.  Nothing like it on Earth. Believe me! Tostada (Carne Asada) : Bomb All Meat Burrito (Carne Asada): Bomb Tacos: Bomb Sweet Tamale: Bomb Everything else tastes great!  But those four are a part of my daily diet. The service is just like any other Mexican joint.  Indifferent and dull.   After you pour on the red and green sauce onto the tostada... WOW is what happens in your mooouuuthhh! One piece of advice: Do not talk about El Taurino on a plane because you get arrested for saying "bomb" on a plane.

If you give this place anything less than 2 stars for the food.... you either lost your taste buds from...1.) a fire-y car accident where only your tongue got burned or 2.) your tongue got burned from the red sauce at el taurino Sauce = straight up CRACK + FIRE from the SUN Cost = same amount as how much you'd spend at Carl's Jr. buying a number 3 combo.

Back in my youthful rebellious days, this used to be one of our hot spots. A time long ago when my metabolism at least made a reasonable effort to keep up with my unhealthy eating habits, especially the fourth or fifth meal that typically fell between midnight to 3 am. But now, being the Muffin Top King, those days have become a distant sad memory...waa waa waaaaaa Solid place to fulfill your Mexican food cravings, especially late at night. Cheap, delicious morsels of goodness. Especially love the carne asada tostada! Mm mmmm tastyyyy. Grab an horchata while you're at it! The only thing that irks me is the ridiculous wait at times. I don't know, maybe it's just the anticipation of a good meal that makes the wait seem longer? I'm gonna have to bust out my stopwatch next time and see exactly how long it takes to dish out 3 tacos because it seriously felt like 30 minutes last time...

El taurino..why oh why have you gotten so stingy!! I usually go to king taco to satisfy my mexican food cravings but only at el taurino do they have those damn good tostadas. The red sauce is great and its spicy, so if you need water you should bring it yourself because when I went they charged you. They also charged me for sauce which is usually complimentary. The cashier and the workers are extremely rude, which I feel has made me stop wanting to come here. If el taurino's service keeps going down the drain then I'm sure people will eventually want to find another great mexican place like this.

El Taurino and I feel in love back in '85 or '86 ... I was about 9 or 10 years old. El Taurino was a regular in my life up until recently.  Unsure if there was a change in ownership, but the burritos are now thin as flautas! I absolutely LOVE the food here, but I find it completely unacceptable for my taco to have more meat!  The staff also has no clue what customer service is and the wait time is ridiculous. The line staff is always ridiculously unorganized no matter what day of week you visit. Also their speaker system is so loud you may leave DEAF depending on where you sit....LOL!

"Wow, I didn't know they served burgers here!", exclaimed one drunk person behind me. It's not a burger, it's a freakin' al pastor torta, and a pretty darn good one in fact. A buttery bun, tender meat, and some lettuce all neatly tucked into a paper wrapper for easy eating. Great spicy jalepeno and cheese tamales too, especially if you're looking to try something different than the usual tacos and burritos. What bugged me the most about this place was the crowd- maybe it's just LA, or maybe it was just that one particular night, but trying to start a fight over cutting in line for a measly taco just isn't the business at 2 am in the morning, drunk or not.

You guys have to be kidding me with these ratings.  This place is a joke.  Have you guys ever seen burritos even close to being this small?  Like one guy said, it's the "size of a hot pocket".  Truthfully, a hot pocket is fatter.  It's actually the size of a Tina's Microwave burrito...skinny and short.  The tacos....I don't even know what to compare it to...I can't think of anything that small.  The tortilla was the size of a coke can top and it had a table spoon of meat.  The burrito was $5 and some change and the tacos were $1.25 each.   Definitely won't be back here again, ever.

I DO NOT GET IT.  Overhyped tacos.  I waited about a good 1 hr for stupid little tacos when actually, I could have gone outside to their stupid taco track and gotten their stupid tacos even faster.  Probably 99% quicker.  El Taurino is a gimmick and the only reason people dig it is b/c it's open 24/7.  If you want the real deal for mexican tacos and meats, there's a dope ass place on Mateo and 7th St. called LA REYNA.  Now they know how to make tacos.  Their tacos are straight off the street and they sizzle it on the rotisserie like real Mexicans do.  LA REYNA is where it's at.  El Taurino is where the lame folk go, like the cattle sheep they are.

Alright, this is my first review on yelp and I think El Taurino definitely deserves one. I've been going to King Taco for years so the taste is familiar (practically the same). I've always been getting the asada all meat burrito, but lately I've been wanting to experiment a little and be adventurous. I've been trying all the different meats and here's what I have so far: Great: Asada Molleja (idk exactly what it is but I have been eating this since I was a kid in Argentina and it's delicious!) Suadero (not everyone seems to like it but it's pretty much crispy beef and I loved it!) Ok: Cabeza Lengua (these lacked flavor imo) Yet to try: Al Pastor (yes, I know...) Barbacoa Buche Carnitas Pollo Other than that, sopes are always great. And of course, the sauce... THE sauce... There is no other like it. Sorry for those that have had bad experiences with the workers here. It seems like they only treat Spanish-speakers nicely (thank God I was raised in Argentina ;] ). Also, be ready to wait at least 15 min for your food. It's definitely worth the wait though! The reason why it has 4 stars is the wait and also it's honestly a little expensive, as 1 burrito never seems to fill me up. BUT IT'S WORTH IT!

After a decade of great memories... Looks like it's time to breakup. El Taurino was the usual spot for me to grab tacos, tostadas, and burritos... not far from home and an AMAZING red and green sauce!  I've been loyal up until about two years ago.  Don't get me wrong, their sauces are still damn good but the food has dropped in quality and quantity.  Here are my gripes... 1. The carne asada and el pastor have become dry with a tougher texture. 2. The tacos are served up with less meat. 3. The burritos, well... the burritos are folded with the same size tortilla as usual but you can easily grab with one hand to eat while I used to need both for a proper grip. 4.  El Taurino has added ridiculous charges for "extra" sauce!!!  (extra meaning, asking for enough for your whole meal since they've got no idea how much I love their sauce)   4a.  This point may not deserve it's own bullet so I'll roll it into 4.  It's uncertain but I've heard from a few people that El Taurino is selective about charging these extra fees... yup, something about non Hispanics being among those that are special enough to spend the extra money. Anyhow, thanks to the recent taco truck craze... I've got two tasty trucks near my place.  No doubt their hot sauce can't compete but everything else makes up for it.  If El Taurino ever gets back to the way things should be... I will gladly apologize and come running back.

Really great LA style mexican food! The meat is really tasty and is chopped up into small pieces. The hot sauce is delicious (but verry spicy). Theyre open late so it makes it perfect for after party eats! ...and they have a lot of bull heads and matador decorations...kinda creeps me out bc i'm pretty sure they're real. Theres also a good amount of seating, and a truck out back that also sells food if the inside lines are too long. Tip: There are usually only 2 lines going on, the other windows are for picking up orders. One line is the very right side when you're looking at the windows, and one in front of the entry way in the middle of the restaurant.

My ultimate favorite! Just thinking about El Taurino makes my mouth water...I swear they put crack in their tacos. Over the years, I've noticed just one issue: they are really stingy with the salsa/hot sauce.  I ordered 9 carne asada tacos and 1 all meat burrito and they only gave us 3 salsas and when we asked for more, they said no (they will for a charge).  Okay, then why did you stop putting your crack salsa on my tacos then? UGH!! The price is not the cheapest but I always end up going back since the food is always good. When going on weekends, I always see the Hispanic families eating the weekend special...looks like some sort of rib meat? and the soup but I can't seem to get myself away from the carne asada tacos -_- El Taurino...I love you and hate you at the same time!!!

My dear friend R. loves this spot!  He brought me here for the first time, but since then,  the last two times I've hung out with him near this part of town after hours he asked "Have you ever eaten El Taurino?"  Then I say, "Didn't you take me there last time?"  Then he says, "Oh yeah!"  wide smile flashed across his face.  I'm still not sure if that was just his way of getting to eat there again or if he is confusing me with his other girlfriends, lol, but either way he's cute and I'm down to eat at El Taurino.   The burritos are big- I can only eat half.  Each time I've ordered a Carne Asada Burrito, all meat with hot salsa, onion and cilantro, accompanied with a diet coke.  Delicious.  My dining partner has happily finished the rest, even though he orders the same burrito with a large Horchata that I happily steal sips from when he's not looking.  :-) I think comparing it to King Taco is fair.  The food style, menu, portion size and salsas are similar to the famous taco joint.  Even the size and look of the restaurant is very King Taco-y.  The burritos and tacos here are the bomb.    If you're in the area definitely drop in, especially if you're a King Taco fan.  R. thinks its better... I really can't tell.  I like them both and don't indulge in this type of dining regularly so its a treat for me either way.  Try it and you decide :-) This is a great late night spot too.  wink.   Sabroso!  Trust! xo

Honestly, the only gripe I have with El Taurino is their 1 hour lines and their food portions - two bucks for a bite sized taco? no thanks. $5 dollar burrito the size of a hot pocket? overall, it takes about $20 dollars worth of Mexican food to even get me slightly full, and I'm a pretty small guy.

If they weren't so stingy about their hot sauces, I'd give them 5 stars.  But I gotta admit their tacos and burritos are bomb.  It's the only Mexican food joint I would withstand a 20 minute+ wait.  I've tried it drunk, I've tried it sober - it's good no matter the physical condition.   Kinda pricey because their burritos are on the slim side and tacos are small.  But the meat is well seasoned and very tender.  I love their combination burrito and would probably use 3 of the green sauces.  But noooo I have to mad scrimp on the 1 sauce they give per burrito.  Ridiculous, if you ask me... fast Mexican food is all about the sauces.  It's like going to Wurstkuche and getting charged $.79 extra for the mustard condiment.  It's so unfair to make a hot sauce that good, give you only one, and charge almost a dollar for extra.  I guess it's a smart business decision on their part, but still!! Anyway, if you have cash and don't mind waiting outside, the truck is much faster than if you were to order inside.  And if you really don't want to wait go to King Taco.  Their food tastes pretty much the same and you don't have to endure the ridiculous waiting time at El Taurino.

BOMB AL PASTOR TACOS & CARNE ASADA TOSTADA. Those are my favorite. It is so full of flavor and makes me want to finish gulf it down in one bite. I also got a carne asada burrito but it was kind of dry. The horchata was also really good! Cons - prices are a bit high - the wait is kind of long sometimes if you go fri/sat night when people come after drinking I EVEN DRIVE AN HOUR FROM IRVINE FOR THIS. that's how good it is. if you live in the LA county, you owe yourself at least a trip to try it.

How can you tell when you've got a couple of manly men in your presence? I landed in LAX, my buddy picked me up, and the first thing we talked about was how we were hungry and that we should go get some food. The second thing we talked about was how my buddy met this girl recently and what a nice pair of assets she has. Food, girls, food, girls. Repeat ad nauseum. So my first stop in Los Angeles on my holiday trip was El Taurino. We actually drove straight there from the airport. At the parking lot was parked the El Taurino food truck. The fact that they had a truck came as a surprise to my friend. I'd never been there before, so when I saw the truck, I thought that was it. But we were going inside the restaurant instead. The customers there were a mixed combination of Latino families and random burrito lovers. Their menu is placed squarely above the ordering counter. When ordering your food, Spanish proficiency will do you good. I ordered a lengua burrito and tried to order an all-meat carne asada as well, but language barrier was a cockblock and I only ended up with the lengua burrito when the order came out. But that turned out to have been not such a bad thing as I was already full after having the burrito. That lengua burrito was oh so tender as lengua should be and very satisfying. I was full after one order, but I probably could have eaten three. Add a little bit of hot sauce and what a delicious meal you'd have in front of you. I must go back the next time I'm in LA.

Great place to come after clubbing! For two reasons: 1) sober up and 2) meet new people. If you didn't get to meet hotties at the club, this is your round 2. I had their Al Pastor taco, which was aight. Stole some bites from my friends' burritos. So spicyyyyyy!!! My ears were exploding. I love the bulls hanging on the walls. So fancy.

i think this place was the first mexican restaurant i ate at when i first came to LA. i remember not being impressed. i've been back several times since and unfortunately my opinion hasnt changed. the best thing i've had here was the torta cubana. but it was like the 3rd torta ive ever had so i dont know how great it really is. if i ever go back, i'd probably get a couple tacos and a couple tamales. the tamales were great (probly my 3rd tamale ever as well). dont get the burrito, it has very little meat and probably won't leave u satisfied. i wasnt a fan of the sope, i found it kind of hard to eat. cotija cheese was an interesting first time experience though. perhaps the biggest turnoff is that there is no salsa bar. oh and they dont give u free water.. whats up with that? the way they charge u for everything is a bit cold and unfriendly. the salsa roja is nice and spicy. the memory of a white friend freaking out from the spice level is one that will always bring an endearing smile to my face. him berating himself, exclaiming "always green sauce! always green sauce!" lol.

Oh El Taurino. It's 2 AM and we're a group of hungry & poor students. El Taurino was a default. The food is decent and adequate. Their al pastor is definitely delicious. However, every time I've made my way to El Taurino, I've been treated very rudely by the staff. Not to mention, the food takes forever. Other than that, if you're looking for some good Mexican food with BOMB hot sauce, this is the place to go!

This place was OK. I had the tacos carne asada, al pastor, and buche; and the sweet tamales. I still think the best places in So Cal for tacos are in San Diego. If you like hot sauce, their red hot sauce has a lot of heat. Not sure if they have my preferred salsa, salsa verde.

Super overrated! Whatever taco truck would have better food than this one and not be stingy with their toppings and sauces. Service is horrible. It took 20 mins to get 4 tacos and a burrito. Don't even dare asking for more sauce cause they would not give you any extra. Bad neighborhood, don't go there at night unless you want to get shot. There is a reason why there are security guards. It is called a "restaurant" but they close it at night and you have to order from a taco truck, good luck with that.

What's the big deal with this place? Maybe I just wasn't in the mood to wait in line... but it just wasn't worth it after almost 60 minutes of wait. All I order were the tacos and nachos. King Taco is just as good, if not better, and definitely not as long of a wait. Here's my story: Thinking I can avoid the line during the lunch rush (around 2PM), I first went to the truck in the back. I didn't realize it was only for taco orders. I went ahead and ordered 3. I gave the lady $7 and mistakenly heard her said, "56" as my order. My friends wanted nachos as well, so my party and I circled to the front to wait in the line I wanted to avoid in the first place. About 20 minutes passed but we were nowhere near the cashier. So, I send a couple friends to retrieve the tacos. Another 15 minutes later, they returned (and I was still in line). "What took so long?" I asked. They narrated their trip back to the truck to ask for order "56". After several moments of puzzling looks from the other side, they finally cleared up the confusion. I had owed them "50 cents!" They never started on the order because I just walked off without paying in full. (They must have thought I was crazy to drop off $7 and walked away!) My friends had to pitch in the 50 cents and wait for the order anyways. After all that, they returned, we waited for another 10 minutes before I could order. We then went across the street to the supermarket to buy a couple more items. When we got back, I naively thought the food would be ready... little did I know... another 20 minutes would pass before we finally got our order. I'm going to King Taco next time.

I've always ordered their tacos with their extremely red hot sauce. Until I tried their savory sope. IT was small, BUT they put this cheese that tastes like dried cottage cheese and the crispy and soft shell pleases my tongue for sure. I suggest trying sope with the green salsa. Long lines almost all the time but the food represents and makes me appreciate their culture with every  small bite and I can say that I have eaten and can eat Mexican food every other day.

Exact same thing as King Taco. I even asked the workers and they informed me that its the same brand with a different name. Only reason why one comes here its because they are open late and i will never be able to control the drunchies. However if you come between 2-3 be ready to wait 30-45 mins for a damn burrito and dont even attempt to ask for some extra salsa. They will say " SALSA INSIDE"  and tell you to go away or just ignore you. Some people say this is better than king taco because they carry tostadas. Stop playin bro, they have tostadas at the king taco in pasadena. So stop being sucha noob. They also dont have water cups, I always thought that was illegal but why bother with them. Oh and if you are korean be ready for some BTS the next morning lol

The bf has been hyping up El Taurino and nearby Langers for such a loooooooooooong time now that I finally put my foot down and demanded that we stop talking about it and finally try them out!   First on deck - late Friday night/early Saturday morning stop at El Taurino for that ubiquitous late night meal of So Cal Mexican food.  Yummers. They have a pretty large parking lot and I gotta admit I feel kinda bad for the residents that are located next door - since this is a 24-hour joint the lights are on all the time.  Good for the ladies & extremely drunk club goers but you'll notice that the neighbors all have their blinds on.  I tried not to be too loud walking from the car to the restaurant. They normally have their truck parked outside for quick walk-ups, but if you want  to hang out, enter through their double doors on Hoover and the side street.  The entrance on Hoover will deposit you directly into the ordering line.  Menus are listed on the wall above the counter windows and I couldn't resist ordering carne asada nachos with extra roja sauce and guacamole (both will cost you a few extra cents and a buck for the guac) and an horchata.  The bf ordered a quesadilla and a burrito and soda.   We had a bit of a wait and I took the time to people watch. Surprisingly there's hella young K-town kids hanging out.  I'm guessing its the under 21 crowd that's looking to socialize and stay out late but can't get into the bars. There was also a post clubbing group of two girls - one who was still super inebriated and trying to keep her ish together to prevent upchuckage and a friend on the phone who was waiting for her man to return with their food. Suprisingly he brought back a pitcher of beer as well to keep the party going - so if you're looking to drink and have your post drinking sober me up Mexican food in one place, El Taurino is your joint! There's also a jukebox in the corner and the entire restaurant is covered in matador and bull fighting ephemera - posters, paintings, and even two taxiderm bull heads. Finally food arrives and I'm glad I ordered the horchata because I nearly blast my mouth off with the hotness of the roja sauce and the surprisingly spicy guacamole.   I quench the beginnings of heartburn with little sips of horchata the whole time after I doused my nachos with the sauces.  The cheese is your usual nacho cheese sauce and the carne asada is interestingly flavorful. My bf's quesadilla is good and I don't even get to try the burrito bc I'm just too full from my nachos.  I regret ordering the extra roja sauce as my bf's quesadilla comes with it already and we both don't end up using much of it on our food.  Next time I'm brining that roja sauce home with me to sauce up my food for a spicy kick. El Taurino is now one of my new snack joints when I'm craving some good Mexican food, particularly after a night of carousing and drinking in nearby K-town.

I don't have time for a full review, but it'd be a waste of time anyways so to keep it short and simple.. most standard mexican food ever.  It's completely hype driven.  The burritos were tiny -- might as well call them a wrapped up taco.  It was seriously just a bit of steak (which wasn't all that flavorful), onions, and rice.  Usually this combination would suffice, but the tiny portion sizes and the lack of flavor ticked me off so much I had to review it.   & NO SALSA BAR. WHAT THE HECK?  Don't you dare charge me for salsa!   BUT.. horchata was great. highly recommend it(:

I finally got to try this place last night! Hot sauce was good, as people say, but NOT THAT SPICY! Also, I felt the burritos were kind of small. I think I inhaled it in about a nanosecond. I'm kind of a pig though so... yeah. What's portion control? No idea. Prices are okay, but not as good as some other places! Food was pretty good I guess. Only sad thing is it's not really all that vegetarian friendly. Oh, and horchata was pretty good, which made me happy. I can definitely see why this place is popular. I'd imagine it would be filled and super busy with drunk/stoned college students at 12 am+ but luckily, it's relatively big and has two lines.

I think this was a better version of King Taco, but the only advantage from other king taco's I've been too was I never had to struggle so hard to find seating, people who are just waiting for take out orders take up seating, I wish they had a different section for just take out. We ordered sopes & tacos de al pastor, carnitas, carne asada and rice and beans, what seemed forever when you starving was actually quite fast. My only real complaint was the portions seem small and it is pricey for a taco I think it was close to $2 and some change and close to $3 and some change for sopes. I will admit I left still hungry and wished I had ordered more but since it was my first time there I ordered cautiously. Good highlights where there's plenty of private parking in the back, they have a food truck for catering and for us ladies, they have purse holders. Since this location is very close to my job I see myself here quite often.

Before I start this review, I shall say that I will forever choose King Taco over El Taurino. I guess the good thing about this place is that it's located somewhat near KTown, open 24 hours (?), and has tostados (which I've never tried but heard very good things about).   They also have a truck outside where you can order your food if the lines inside are too long Now the bad... - Food portions are very small. - They charge you extra for additional sauces. - Workers can be rude at times. There's a lot of drunks if you come on a weekend night.  After a night of partying, Mexican food is delish.  So... I'm not going to stop coming here.  But if King Taco is open or near my area, I'll most def go there first.  If not... Then El Taurino, off I go.

I had major expectations because everyone raves about this stuff. I mean I guess they're cheap but chipotle has better tacos, really. My friend had been talking about this places for as long as I remember and he finally brought me here. We each got three tacos -- half carne asada and half al pastor -- and I wasn't pleasantly surprised. The tacos were minuscule and not well seasoned and just all around subpar. I do not understand. Line inside was a 40 minute wait btw. We just ordered from the truck outside which was much faster, and then found a booth. I would've given them an even lower rating if I waited any longer for this :/

Some friends from LA were really keen that I try two things here: the spicy hot sauce and the carne asada burrito.  The hot sauce looks like tapatio sauce but is a little thicker and has a really good blend of spices.  It got spicier through the meal and even burned my lips slightly but the flavor makes it worth it. Good burrito as well but for me the highlight was the hot sauce.

If you haven't heard of El Taurino, then you probably don't live in LA or come here often.  Known for their street tacos and bustling crowds at all times of the day and night, it's a landmark eatery for late night munchies.  I've been quite addicted to the place for the past year or so, eating there nearly weekly. The food is very tasty - I love their burritos; their carne asada burrito with no beans with jack cheese (melted) added and sauce on the side, is my go-to choice along with a carne asada taco on the side. They've always been very stingy with their hot sauces but it seems to have gotten worse as of late.  They will count how much items you have and limit the sauces you get (and be very mean about it).  They seem to do this more to non-Hispanics so if you're Asian, like myself, you'll probably get less sauce than you desired. Case in point: my family went their for dinner tonight and ordered 3 burritos, a torta, a tostada, 5 tacos, and a tamale.  We got 5 sauces total!  One for each burrito, one for the torta and tostada combined, and one for all five tacos combined!  I was shocked and upset that the lady wouldn't budge and give me a couple more.  She argued that I didn't get a sauce for the tamale and that one sauce should be enough for five tacos!  On top of that, we got one of the skinniest burritos I've had there with hardly any onions/cilantro in all our burritos!  For a $5 burrito and $1.25 taco, I should at least get one sauce each or have a consistently sized burrito. It was upsetting and you'll probably have some of these moments at least half the time you go there.  I'd say about 20% of the time, the burritos come out normal sized and you'll get the sauces you need.  The other 80% of the time, prepare to be disappointed by the size of your burrito (or amount of toppings on any given food item) as well as the horrible service and general meanness for non-Hispanic customers.   It's really quite hideous and I'd love to boycott it, but like I said in the first of my long-winded review, this place can be addicting!  Go at your own peril!

El Taurinos, has a lot of  koreans and chinos, eating tostadas and  burritos It's preeeetty good. Not epic, but pretty tasty. I ordered the pollo tostada and smothered it with hot sauce, which made it more flavorful, but definitely made my tongue feel the burnnn. I came here with a friend, to meet up with a few friends, which I would recommend... since it's not really in the kind-of neighborhood you'd want to venture out on your own.. well, at least if you're 5'3" and valley-bred.

I love partying in DTLA because I know I'm going to end up at El Taurino afterwards :) I've been late night dining at this place for over a decade and I still love it. The place itself is not in the best area and the people that go in are questionable sometimes but the food and service makes up for it. It can get crowded after 2am so finding a table can be a pain or you can order from the truck outside and eat in your car. There is plenty of parking and a security guard always directing traffic. My personal favorites are torta de milanesa or carne asada, carne asada tacos, carne asada sope, carne asada burrito...yes, I love me some carne asada. The horchata, tamarindo, jamaica, and agua de pina is really good. This is the ONLY place that serves my favorite hot sauce, the red sauce! It makes me cry because I add so much of it to my food but I love it. Prices have gone up but they are still reasonable. The wait for your order can be a while but once they call your number the guys/ladies making the food are friendly and fast on execution. El Taurino and King Taco are the place to be for some late night grub!

Though it isn't my favorite taco joint in Los Angeles, it's a very close second. Along with King Taco, it is probably the most recognized taco joint to Los Angelinos. This place is perfect for late night drunchies and actually any time of the day. You usually order at one of two counters, pay, and then receive your food at another counter down the "assembly line". They have the best Pastor meat in all of Los Angeles, marinated perfectly with nice chunks of roasted Pineapple in them so make sure to try them out.The tacos are regular sized, small, so you may need 4+ to be even remotely satisfied. When you get your food, they will ask what kind of sauce you want. Almost everyone gets the red sauce, which is infamously spicy but so good. You may want to order a glass of horchata to help cool your tongue. Aside from the tacos, their tortas are amazing. Filled with the meat of your choice, grilled onions, beans(I prefer to skip this), and avocados, the tortas are amazing. Also, you will notice that many of the frequent customers and Hispanics will be ordering a plate that has what looks like Galbi, without the marination, a side of beans, guacamole, and grilled onions. It's name is Costillas Rancheros. It seems to be really popular amongst the Hispanic customers and I've tried it a few times but though it was pretty good, I don't think its worth the price and the meat tends to be rather tough. So I'll stick with my tacos and Tortas from now on.

Bombdotcom. I love this place, especially their tacos and burritos. It is super cheap. Nachos are not the best, but its not too bad for the price. It comes with meat, cheese, and onions. The nachos in my opinion are a bit salty, but ehh, it will do. Tortas are bomb too. It is a bit too bready, but I usually only eat the bottom part of the bread. There is plenty of seating inside and parking isn't too bad. I never had to park on the street coming here while it was packed.

The reason to come here instead of King Taco is for the tostada & torta. I have yet to try a better Tostada or Torta anywhere else. The burritos, tacos, etc., are good but you can find other hole in the wall places that serve those that are just as good. But we all know the real reason EVERYONE comes here or King Taco...it's their Crack Hot Sauce. I'd swear they sprinkle crack in it, its so damn good and addicting. Whenever I get the itch, it's relieved with some roja and verde sauce.

I ate here twice in the past month or so.  Once, I ate it as a last meal before heading to China for a few weeks.  Us Angelenos generally know, if you're gonna leave, esp to Asia, sure you'll miss In n Out, but it's Mexican food that you better have before getting the blindfold put on, and being stood next to a wall. I remember Anthony Bourdain saying he loves KFC mac n cheese.  Well, I really like the nachos w/ their cheapie nacho sauce.  I usually get lengua and al pastor tacos at most taco joints.  I did this night, but didn't even touch them.   This joint, for ME, is all about cheap cheese, nachos, and green sauce.  Check.

I dont know why I am reviewing this place since all of LA loves this place but here goes! El Taurino. What can I say? People always mention about the Mexican good in LA. Well I say that this is the poster boy of LA's Mexican. I would say the items to get here are the tacos, sopes, tostadas and tortas (NO BURRITOS!). Although these items that I have mentioned maybe small, they do pack quite a PUNCH. So do not be fooled. I highly recommend that you guys at least try the hot sauce. It is pretty much fire and really good. If you can handle spicy than yeah dont try it. Even though that this is a very popular place there are some FLAWS. And let me tell you, there are A LOT of them. WATER: Whenever you order, do not expect to get a cup of water. I specifically asked them a "cup of water" but NOOOO she gave me a bottle of aquafina and boom there goes another 2 bucks right there. So yeah unless if you want the cool refreshing taste of BOTTLED water, feel free to get some water. LATE NIGHT: One good thing about El Taurino is that it is open practically 24 hours. BUT there is a catch to it. If you are hungry on a late Friday or Saturday night and SOBER, go someplace else. If you're DRUNK as hell, then yeah sure go. There is a huge "drunchie" rush at round 1-4 am at friday and saturday nights. So if you enjoy the company of many intoxicated asians on a friday/saturday night feel free to go. Not to mention that during this "drunchie" run, food takes forever to get. PRICE: Honestly though, for Mexican street food, the price is kind of high. Now I dont want to sound like I am just another stereotypical "stingy asian" but I have eaten at other places that taste better than el taurino at a cheaper price. Although I mentioned a couple flaws about this place, it is really not the restaurant to blame. So i guess these FLAWS were more so WARNINGS. Other than that, like I mentioned before "poster boy of LAs  Mexican." That enough should warrant at least a visit.

You can order beer!!!! Can definitely be confusing. When it's busy there are two lines, but usually there's one in the middle of the restaurant. Also, as they call your number (it can definitely be out of order), remember to ask for what you may want (green salsa, straws?). It would also help to know some spanish. Burritos are a little small but the mexican rice is pretty good. I recommend trying something new. You may be surprised.

Maybe its just a big conspiracy or something. I don't see how this place could have higher than three stars at best. I could only give it two. You could chalk it up to the bland meat or the rude employees. I just remember hearing alot of hype for this place and expecting to be blown away. Talk about a let down. Everything lacked flavor and really the only way to make the tacos and sopes redeemable was to drown them in salsa. Its just too bad since they are open so late, and I dig places like that.

What's up with the all hype here? This place is ok. I guess it's a good spot to grab a quick bite if you're drunk after the club. I came here after a game from the Staples Center for some tacos. We ordered 4 tacos: 2 asada, 1 cabeza, 1 lengua, an asada burrito and a large horchata. Everything tasted bleh. Nothing stood out. A lot of the reviews here recommend the asada tacos. I thought it was bland and dry. There was no flavor as if they didn't season the meats. All I could taste was the onions and cilantro. The only thing that made it better was the spicy red sauce they give on the side. I had a bite of the burrito and it was also a disappointment. Taco Sinaloa in Torrance is the best on my list. Until then, find me there unless anyone begs to differ.

With over 800 reviews and a 4 star rating, I think I am allowed to go this restaurant expecting great food.  However, I will never go back to El Taurino again!  Let me mention a couple good things about this place first.  The Hot sauce is very good and the tostadas are good, but that's about all. They definitely put time and effort to keep their kitchen clean and it shows in the quality of the food.   Here we go with the negatives.  First off, I don't understand how you can charge 6 dollars for a carne asada burrito that you can finish in literally 4 bites.  If your going to make a burrito that small especially since every other Mexican restaurant makes a reasonably sized burrito for that price, the taste had better be worth it.....sadly it was not.  Also, if i wanted nachos like the ones I ate at El Taurino, I could have just gone to the movie theater and bought nachos better than that. I do not understand how you can mess up on nachos.   I have been using yelp for all my dining experiences, but eating at El Taurino trully inspired me to write this review.  I really believe the reason this restaurant has a 4 star rating is because the late night drunk people could not tell the difference between good and bad Mexican food, everything taste good when your drunk.

I don't think I've ever had proper Mexican food ever after eating here.  The food was amazing.  I came into this place with a recommendation from a friend who lives in LA.  She said it's a late night spot that gets busy and is particularly good.   Boy she wasn't lying.  I saw the menu and i had to suddenly try EVERYTHING!  I went with 2 fried pork tacos along with an all meat burrito and a jalapeno and cheese tamale.  HOLY CRAP!  Everything was delicious!  Their salsas were delicious, tacos were awesome - the Tamale was very HOT!  I love the spicyness of it.  They don't joke when they say its spicy.

Nobody really talks about tortas. Tacos and burritos get all the play.   Well, I gave the torta a chance. I feel compelled to share with the Yelp world my experience with the torta here. It must be known that I had the best CARNE ASADA TORTA in my life. No joke. This is how I remember it: I took a bite into the torta and I instantly felt like I was transported to home in Mexico. The funny thing is, I'm not Mexican. I think it's the same feeling as eating comfort food in the motherland; a return to home and the family. My friend can attest to my reaction. He would say that the look on my face was of pure bliss. Dear Yelpers, I don't know if you've ever had an experience like this before, but it was absolutely mind-blowing, and rare. The flavor of the meat and the sauce was amazing, while the lettuce was crunchy, and the bread was warm. Trust me, I've had boring tortas before, like at Taco Mesa. However, this was incomparable. I also had the carne asada tacos and burrito, which were only average, but their special red hot sauce totally made it. Disregard the ridiculous 30 min. wait for food on weekends, the wait for the dirty, single bathrooms, more waiting for tables, and the incoherent numbers being shouted over the loudspeaker. Remember that you came for the good, old-fashioned, home-style food.

Gave them one more chance... they got worse. Come here if you want overpriced mini sized burritos that look more like tacos. Don't ask for extra onions, sauce, etc.  They will charge you for EVERYTHING.  They will get pissed if you ask for extra napkins. DO NOT COME HERE! So sad... I used to love this place.

Worst place ever! Bunch of extortion employees without wearing ski mask. I just don't know how they sleep at night. Oh yeah, it's a 24 hour joint. Their Security Guards are brunch of Assholes. If you want the prison environment then this is the place to eat.   I don't know why they don't have a sign stating sauce, onion and lime costs money.  Really?  No refill on soda with 70% ice? All sodas are required to have ice in their cups. What's next soda in shot glass? After leaving this place I feel so dirty and feel like I got scammed. If you are craving for tacos, head down to King Taco and enjoy your food with local gangsters.

Worked 9 straight days, and I went out with some coworkers after my shift to celebrate the end of it! It wasn't really anything fancy, but we decided to grab some good ol Mexican food from El Taurino. At 1 AM, it was still pretty packed. Their al pastor tacos are slightly sweet and really scrumptious, and so are their crispy sopes! Their tortas are supposed to be really good too, but I haven't had a chance to try them yet. The only complaint is that they're kind of stingy! I remember coming here a while back, and it was just like any other Mexican joint in that if you asked for something, they gave it. Now they charge you extra for sauces, limes and lemons (yes for one wedge they'll charge you extra), and other things! Talk about putting a price tag on EVERYTHING. :( *Edit 7/19: Went again and tried the cubano torta. Sooooo delicious! Soft toasty bread with milanesa (breaded steak), avocado, cheese, tomato, mayo, and bacon!

Don't get me wrong, I liked El Taurino. But waiting in line for 20 minutes, then having to find a seat (which took another 15 minutes), and waiting for your your number to be called for ANOTHER 20 minutes, just for three measly tacos?! Sorry, but that's negative two stars in my book. Their horchata is probably the best I've had, and their hot sauce is undeniably delicious. But I can say that I've had tacos that tasted just as good as El Taurino's from a truck. And I never have to wait that long for my food!

RIP OFF TACOS W/ LOW QUALITY MEAT ...........EVER!  How could you, El Taurino??? I hate you now.  Never again will I ever set my feet in there and ever order food from you! Why, you ask? I'll give you 5 reasons: #1.  You don't give refills and expect me to buy a WHOLE NEW CUP.  When I said, "no ice", you said "Sorry, we gotta give you ice". #2. I ordered the cheese fries that clearly had a picture of jalepenos on it.  When I got my fries, there were NO jalepenos. Just cheese on the fries. WTF?  Even better.. When I went to ask you for some jalepenos, you said $.50. I said, "NO. The picture on the menu has jalepenos!" So, you go there and get me some but add the juice in my fries. WTF, asshole? #3.  We ordered 6-8 tacos and we only got 4 sauces (3 green and 1 red), but the sauces weren't even filled up. It BARELY had any sauce.  When I asked for more, you said I had to PAY UP FOR EXTRA SAUCE. WTF?!?! #4.  Okay, so I didn't get any lime or lemon with my tacos, so I went back up AGAIN and asked for some.  You said to PAY UP for ONE fucking wedge!  WTF, asshole!? #5. You're hella stingy on the fries, the cheese, the carne asada for my tacos.  Go to HELL! I don't even know why you have a stupid ass rent-a-cop inside the restaurant.  Who'd ever rob your cheap ass?! PS - Oh yeah....and that was me who left all that shit on the table for your ass to clean up after me at 1am.  Shitty service deserves shitty mess on your nasty ass table.  Fuck you, I'm NEVER coming back.

So my cousin Brian and I have been fighting about who has the best Nachos in and around the North east  L.A. area for the past few months. I mean this argument has reaaaaally gotten heated. I for one, love La Estrella on Fletcher Dr. in Glassell Park. He on the other hand digs the fresh cheese nachos at El Tapatio in Glendale. My besterson Eri-Chan loves La Estrella too. but one day, the Homie PAUL brings up, El Taurino... and says it'll smash us both. so one day, a spur of the moment Nacho taste test hits me. So i ask Eri to meet me there for dinner. First of all, the lines are long. I thought, "Damnnnn, the food must be awesome from these loooong ass lines, and a good multi-cultural mix of people waiting in these long ass lines." Eri gets there, and like pigs we decide to try more stuff. 2 orders of carne asada nachos, a pork tamale, a chicken tamale, carnitas taco, and a buche taco. tacos.... ehh normal. tamales... ehhh normal The nachos came with just chips, meat, and cheese. WTFFFFFFFFFFF where's the rest at..??? This isht sucked!!!!!!!!!!!! I mean, the meat was tasty... but where are the necessities that Nachos need? Salsa, sour cream, onions, cilantro...?? NADA..!!! that was as plain as it can get. when i told Brian about it, he said it best, "So its like Movie Nachos..?" hahahahahsorry but these lines arent worth it!!

Torta Milanesa. Try it. Life won't seem so important after you've tried it. Tostadas. Best ones I've ever had. Cheese is divine. Avocado on top? Stop it.. You're too much! Sopes. Where have you been?? I just had my first one recently and oh my goodness... it's a softer tostada.. no wait, it's not.. What is this?!? Why are you so soft and so good?? Nachos. What is this cheese? Why don't my nachos at home taste like this.. Only downside: What the heck is their refill policy??

Better then King Taco? Well there is a major debate on that. Many people say that their al pastor is better then King Tacos. So after hearing that this place might be better then King Taco, I had to try this place. I tried their buritto with carne asada, and had two tacos with al pastor. It was amazing! UGH....where have this place been all my life! If you guys are near by, you guys have to try this place out yourself. Its just one of the best mexican places ever. I will say that their buritto is better then King Tacos, but no one can beat King Taco's tacos and sauce. So when it comes down to it, Is this place better then King Taco? I think its still up in the air for me, because I cant decide :)

Parking could be difficult if it gets crowded. People come their spicy sauce or their food to King Taco......really, I love both but maybe this place better because its just a more fun environment? They decorate the walls with bull heads, pictures and loud mexican music haha Drinks can be expensive and not refillable or I'm not sure if their is a charge for refills. Maybe worth the drive if you're 10minutes away? But anymore, I'm not sure because LA overall has alot of options for decent mexican food.

Used to be a 4-5 star place, but after choking on dry meat on Saturday these guys need to get back on the ball. Also it took like 40 min to get 5 burritos and some tacos. What happened? Did you go out to slaughter a cow for our order? Mexican food should be fast to serve. The meat in my puro asada burrito was so dry I had to jump up and down to get the food down my esophagus. How dry? It was SO dry I tried to light my match on it! It was SO dry that it felt like I was swallowing a mouthful of dirt! That's bad! Real BAD! The sauce is still the best! Meat is flavorful, but I think money made this place lose it's way. ***This has been an UNPAID MESSAGE to management at El Taurino from the WORDS ON THE STREET.

I kept hearing from everyone that I have to try El Taurinos while I was in LA. It was my vacay to LA and I came here with my friend and his cousin before we went out to drink. I ended up ordering the beef and pork tacos. I remember my parents (when they lived in LA long time ago) use to tell me that they always ate the little tacos in LA. They always said good things about it. So, I was pretty excited to have it from all the hype that people gave it. The tacos were real good but I actually had a higher expectations. The sauce was madd good. Next time I come to LA, I want to try the burritos. It was madd packed and the line was pretty long. It was kind of hard to get a table but that means a good thing. I noticed that all the customers there were either Mexican or Korean. I thought that was pretty funny. All in all...the tacos were good and I would definitely come back. akatek1

I had really high expectations because I've been hearing great things about this place for the longest.  I finally had a chance to try it today. We ordered a few carne asada tacos and a carne asada sope.  Seating was a bit hard to come by but we did manage to find a table.  When my boyfriend brought the food to the table, I had my hands in that ready to get grubbing position.  Then I looked at him and asked "where's the lime?"  What!?!?!  You have to pay for it?  Seriously.....I never had to pay for lime or extra salsa anywhere!  That kinda put a damper on my experience. Carne Asada Taco: The meat was a bit dry but it was very very flavorful.  The red sauce has hella kick to it!  It hella burns but in a good way.   Carne Asada Sope:  I really enjoyed eating this.  This came with green sauce which was delicious.  The sauce was mild yet full of flavors.   1 sope came with 1 container of sauce yet 5 tacos came with only 1?  I mean I get that you should probably go easy on the red sauce but still, I would love to have the option of setting my mouth on fire. I would eat here again but there is another place I prefer over this.

Been a fan of this place for almost 20 years, but am done with it. There are a lot of other great taco restaurants in LA with more foods and better services.

Just like King Taco but with a longer wait and more creatures of the night. Also the parking here is such a hassle and it's in a shadier and more deserted part of town. However, I WILL come here if King Taco is closed and I WILL wait in that godforsaken line for my delicious al pastor tacos. P.S. Al pastor is the only thing you should get here. The carne asada is dry and too limey for comfort, and the chicken is oh so boring. I can't review the other more adventurous meats, and I never will.

Only difference between El Taurino and King Tacos is the god damn wait. I've only been here late nights and they are crowded as hell. It can take up to like 30 mins or more for just a simple taco/burrito. God damn!! Tacos are just as dinky as King Tacos and just as plain and boring. Satisfies my late night drunken munchies but not my taste buds.

Went in the middle of the day with the BF after a long morning of moving and and holy moley they are so slow here. There were only 3 people ahead of me but it took me a half an hour to get my two little tacos. The tacos were average. I've had better. The orangeish salsa on top is SPICY so watch out. They don't have free water either. I guess I'm spoiled by all the 24 hour mexican places in SD but I'm used to self serve salsa, carrots, and limes. You had to pay extra for all these things at El Taurino :[ I  like to drown everything I eat in salsa so that doesn't work so well for me. I'll continue looking around for a replacement to Riggobertos and Santanas.

El Taurino is where I come when I want a delicious burrito and some of the hottest hot sauce in the city. It's also a great spot to visit if you don't mind having armed guards protect you while you drunkenly munch on a neatly wrapped burrito. El Taurino isn't the cleanest and most relaxing place, but they make one of the best burritos in town.

I've gone to this place so many times because it's right by school. the carne asada tacos are okay, a bit too dry/healthy IMO... al pastor sucks and is not real al pastor. the only thing great is their burn your face off red sauce

Love the burritos and tostadas here. Always  order my burritos without the beans and sour cream inside with red sauces for the kick. It is awesome. The tostada is one of the best anywhere. Try it and you will love it. The is the place when I want a Mexican fix. Better then King Taco.

This place is lame.  The tacos weren't very good.  I had al pastor and asada tacos.The nachos were gross (both the chips and the processed cheese). Also, water only comes in a bottle here.

Set up fast-food style with bright florescent lights and traditional mexican decor.  Ordering takes way too long, but once that is done your food is ready within 5 minutes.   As per everyone's recs - the carne asada tacos and tostado were both good, I was not blown away but perhaps that is because it wasnt 2am when I showed up here (at that time ANYTHING tastes good).  I was a little pissed off that they charged extra for every little thing (tomato, onion, jalapenos...).  Dont get me wrong, this place is dirt cheap, but you shouldn't have to ask for those items on a Mexican dish.

WHY do people think this place is so amazing?! Everyone speaks to you in spanish and gets pissed off at you because you don't understand what they are saying (i'm sorry, but I took French in high school, should i be penalized for it?! i mean really?!). The quality of meat is something that I wouldn't feed my beautiful dogs, nevertheless let my body digest ever again. I ate here once and that will be my one and only El Taurino experience. I would rather risk getting a DUI and driving down .25 miles to taco bell. I wouldn't eat here even if I was hammered and I was having a hypoglycemic episode. I would rather starve, then eat here. You get the point. WAY OVERRATED.

You know a mexican joint is good if you would come here sober.  Of course I've never had the experience sober, but if it's a quarter as good as it is when drunk, then it's requires no second thought. I may be jaded because I am deprived of even mediocre mexican food in New York City, but of the three times I have gone to El Taurino, thrice have I been enamored.  The food is savory, flavorful, and not as greasy as you would expect.  Plenty of seating round the clock with a diverse crowd.  Diversity in the late hours of the night points to one thing, it's good and everyone likes it. If I'm in DTLA stomping around the block, I will definitely make a stop regardless of how my stomach feels.  I have to...for I can only sample great mexican food once or twice a year.

This place is pretty good when you don't have to wait in a long line! I just got the al pastor tacos and I think it was sitting for a while b/c the tortilla was pretty chewy/cold, but the meat and the red sauce was delicious. The red sauce is pretty spicy so if you like spicy..GET AT THIS. I also got their cheese and jalapeno tamale, reallllly good too! The tamale was nice and hot and the cheese wasn't the melt-y kind, it's the kind that still stays in it's form. I would go back, the restaurant itself is super spacious and the prices are really cheap! :)

This place has the most authentic Mexican food I've ever had in LA!! Their tacos and tortas are amazing! I usually get them with al pastor/ carne asada-- the meat is always juicy and flavorful! Also, ask for their green sauce! It's bomb! The tacos are a bit small though, so if you're hungry or a big eater, order 3 or 4 tacos at least! If you're thirsty, their horchata is also a big hit! I also love that this place is 24/7! Great for late night munchies! The wait can be long here sometimes, but the food is well worth the wait!

Not to wax poetically about a joint that has iron railings over all exits and armed security on-site AND in the parking lot, but this is still the only place 100% guaranteed to make me happy after whatever life throws at me, and the first place I head to after a long business trip from somewhere that has no concept of Mexican food (Baton Rouge, I'm looking at you). Yes, you will get nickel-and-dimed on everything but the plastic utensils. Keep in mind El Taurino is a business, not a philanthropic organization teaching pygmy widows and orphans how to hand weave baskets out of banana leaves in the jungles of Madagascar. Also factor in that the red hot sauce will make you soberer than a nun at a funeral, and $12 is cheaper than getting a DUI. Yes, the nachos are made with generic Velveeta. I don't come here for cave-aged white cheddar from Ireland and neither should you. Yes, the bathroom looks like it was purchased secondhand from a women's correctional facility. Yes, the portions have gotten much smaller in the past 3 years. An average order is 3 large items (burrito, torta, etc.) or 5 tacos. Yes, the parking lot is a trifecta of all that is wrong with drivers in LA: semi-drunks, Asian women, and college boys taking text orders from the rest of their fraternity while parking. Yes, the clown gives more nightmares to adults than balloon animals to children. Yes, you will have to wait so long you will definitely be paying a visit to the aforementioned bathroom; watch your step for emergency shanks hidden by former inmates like squirrels with their winter stockpile.

hmmmm I don't really get this place?  How could it have 4 star average with 700+ reviews?  Has it gone down hill or something? We came here at midnight after a concert at Hollywood Bowl for a quick bite.  I wasn't too hungry so I was hesitant about getting a burrito (thought it could be too much). Since I'm usually disappointed at the tininess of tacos, I decided to just get a burrito anyway.   I got the carne asada burrito and let me tell you.. I had no problem finishing this burrito.  Not because it was amazingly tasty, but because it was SOOOOOO small.  There was no meat that I could taste (I think I counted maybe 10 bean sized meat pieces in the whole burrito.   Their spicy salsa sauce was spicy but that was probably the best thing about El Taurino. I was expecting amazing Mexican in SoCal but I have to say El Farrolito in the bay area  trumps this place. Hands down.   El Farrolito is cheaper and bigger and fatter.

I am not a big fan of Mexican Food, but notice I have been eating it more often lately, so I am not sure if I am a good judge of it or not, but here it goes: Today, I tried one Carne Asada Taco and Carne Asada Quesadilla (in hind sight, I should've tried Chicken or Pork instead of two of the same meats! grrr!) The Carne Asada Taco is small. I swear it seem smaller than other places, but maybe its because they put alot of meat on it. The meat was not "juicy" but not "dry" either...but very tasty & flavorful. It comes with Onions, Cilantro, Red Sauce, Green Sauce & Guac (which I requested on the side). The Carne Asada Quesadilla had a very good meat & cheese ratio, each bite had just enough meat & cheese. I smothered parts of it with Guac & dipped it in the Green Sauce. Next time, I would like to try the Burrito.... I went on a Wednesday afternoon during peak lunch hours and there was plenty of parking in their lot...

I hate to disagree with all the other fellow yelpers, but King Taco is 10x better.  I ordered tacos and was not impressed.  My husband ordered a burrito and it was super small.  He did enjoy the green salsa, but I had to barter with the cook in order to get two small containers of it.

This is the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to, hands down! Everything on their menu is excellent, but my favorites are the tacos and tostadas. I believe El Taurino and King Taco have a similar menu, but the reason why I love El Taurino and HATE King Taco is because King Taco doesn't have tostadas!!  Their red sauce is also AMAZING!!! The only downside is that it can get pretty packed so sometimes it can take really long to order and get your food, especially on the weekends.  But it's all worth it in the end!

The food here is great, especially the tortas. Why the 1 star? The service. It is absoute-friggin horrible. They're very stingy with their sauce, and when I ask for extra, they look at me like I'm asking for their first born. And sometimes will straight up tell me that its extra! One time I had a friend and they gave his order to someone else and when he didn't get his food for like 20mins while everyone that ordered after him did, he went up to the counter to find out. Instead of apologizing or giving him his food, they basically accused him of lying. They ended up digging up old receipt from THE TRASH to try to prove that he already took the food. Basically someone else ended up taking his food, because the guys at the counter didn't even bother to check the ticket. So my friend had to PAY more to get his food. They actually charged him for THEIR mistake. I hate this place with a passion. I will never step foot in this establishment ever again. And their burritos have gotten smaller. They really got cheap in the past year or so. I much prefer King Taco. Same family owns it I believe, but King Taco they're not as stingy, and everything else is better there except for the tortas.

I finally went here after hearing great things from my boyfriend's family (they always went to El Taurino when he was growing up). I wouldn't recommend it to anyone: L.A. has tons of Mexican restaurants, so why patronize one that... a. Has a terrible parking lot b. Needs a security guard at night c. Is dirtier inside than your average McDonald's (Not to mention that the tamales I ordered were dry and kinda rubbery... seemed like they had been cooked a long, long time ago and reheated.)

Taco places in Los Angeles are a dime a dozen...so if you're like me you probably are thinking that El Taurino is going to be the same as the others. WRONG! I'll spare you the miniscule details of the decor (A bullfighting theme) and the fact that the juke box sucks...but the carne AL PASTOR is their specialty. If you like Carne Asada-go to King Taco-but if you like Al Pastor, El Taurino is your place. My suggestion: Torta de Al Pastor AL PASTOR! AL PASTOR! AL PASTOR! *I think you get the hint* :) BTW, I love the fact I can come with a couple of friends and order a pitcher of beer :)

Grew up in the area so I've been coming here since I was a kid. I admit they've gotten VERY stingy. I remember when I came back for the first time as an adult I complained that the burritos were too small and they actually brought out a scale to weigh it... SMH. Yeah, it's come to that. I can see how some people have sworn off this place, but it still holds a place in my heart. Plus I can't say I've had carne asada as good as El Taurino anywhere else other than King Taco and they're one and the same. Word to the wise: the carne asada fries aren't that great. The tacos are good. I've had al pastor and carne asada, both good. The tortas are also pretty good.

I could probably eat El Taurino everyday for the rest of my life. It is the only food that I honestly think that I am addicted to.   The All Meat Carne Asada Burrito drenched in the Red "crack" sauce all downed with a mouthful of Horchata to me is how I fantasize heaven to be like...unlimited all you can eat tacos & burritos. The neighborhood sucks...you dont know when your number is being called becasue you can hardly understand what the person on the mic is saying....there are times where you will be in line for 90 years...the bathrooms are filthy...AND STILL 5 Stars. If I hate you...and you brought El Taurino for me to eat....we could perhaps become best friends for life. Thats how good this is.

C'mon people, how could you hate on a place that'll happily serve you up a pitcher of cheap suds with a plate full of tacos at 10am and do it for a ten spot? Don't look the gift horse in the mouth, my friends. Sure I've had better tacos at some stands and trucks around town but what I really dig here is the lengua. Tongue tacos and some of the hottest salsa in the land washed down with cheap beer. That's what I'm talkin' about. They also do these absolutely obscene taco meat stuffed tortas. Not really my bag but every time I've had a bite I can see why someone would go crazy over it. Come to think of it, thats probably the biggest draw here but those lengua tacos... what can I say. I must be a creature of taco habit 'cause they get me every time. As the name would suggest, they've got an awesome array of bullfighting memorabilia that always gets me to thinking how large a handbag I'd need to make off with some of it. Vintage posters (my favorite),  old sombreros and, of course, more than one bull with you in its hollow sights from above. If anyone has a plan to make off with a few hundred pound vintage mounted bull's head complete with horns, shoot me a note, will ya? Don't bother trying to park on the street. There's a little lot out back complete with security guard. Most of the time at least. What did I tell you? Don't look the gift horse in the mouth!

5 stars for the CARNE ASADA TOSTADA!!!!!! Why have I never gotten this amazing goodness before, in all the past times I've come here?! It's for sure the best thing on the menu! I just love the combination of the thin, crispy tortilla shell, avocado, onions, tomato, cheese, carne asada, and a little dollop of sour cream on top. Ask for the red sauce on the side, or if you look Korean, they'll ask you if you want red sauce when you pick up your order. I guess they know! :P

One word: TOSTADA. That is what I come here for.  My favorite would probably be the carne or the al pastor tostada.  These are not your typical tostadas that people might be thinking of.  There is no tortilla bowl with lettuce and tomato galore, but its a smaller flat tortilla chip piled high with meat and onion goodness with cheese and sour cream on top.  Yum! They offer green or red hot sauce.  I love both....but BEWARE....the red sauce is VERY SPICY.  Try a little bit of the sauce to see how much you can handle.  I know even for some people they think the green sauce is too spicy.   El Taurino....a Los Angeles tradition.

I've lived in a LA for majority of my life and I gotta say that this is the BEST spot for any mexican food. Very ghetto and authentic taste unlike your other "mexican foods" (i.e. taco bell, el torito, on the border, etc.) If you are good with spicy foods use the red sauce, if not settle with the green. Either way the sauces are good, but I prefer the spicier. If you need something to calm your burning hot mouth, try the horchata. Come try this place if you are ever in town! Oh yeahh no frijoles por favor!

My sis ordered our food of head of time and she said, that she had ordered food before, but they didn't start making it until she got there to pick up the food. So we go and pick up our food and they hadn't started it either, but it was pretty quick after we ordered about 10 minutes. What I thought was awesome about this place is they have $7.50 Budweiser and Michelob pitchers, $2.50 for a glass. I had the carne asada torta, and this torta was like making sweet sweet love, for $4.50, so it didn't last long. It had avocado, cheese, cream, tomato, onion and I added red salsa to it, very similar to King Taco salsa. So even though this place has awesome tortas and beer, due to the not having food when you order it, this place had to lose a star.

El Taurino is my Favorite Mexican Joint! My favorite here is the Carnita Torta but everything else here is absolutely delicious!  Carne Asada Burrito, Carne Asada Tacos, Tostadas and the perfect hot sauce (hot and mild) to top it off!  But you gotta be careful because the hot sauce is firing HOT. The place may look at bit sketchy at first because it's not in the best neighborhood, but its really not that bad.  I was a bit scared at first when I first went but after I tried their food, I kept coming back for more. OH and they sell pitchers of beer here!  I think its about $7 a pitcher?  Beer goes so well with carne asada tacos :D The reason why I cannot give this place a full 5 stars is because the food here doesn't settle in my stomach too well all the time :X  But I do crave it once in a while and that doesnt stop me from going to El Taurino to satisfy my cravings!

I don't get it?!?!  My friends have been raving about this place for who knows how long so I was sooo happy to finally come and see what all the hype was about.  One word - DISAPPOINTING.  All 2 stars go to the hot sauce because that stuff is legit.   First, I walked over to the truck and snapped a photo - I got reprimanded by a security guard saying "no pictures allowed"!  What the - it's a freaking truck with El Taurino written on it.  Give me a break, I'm not going to steal your "oh so unique truck restaurant concept". We then walked around into the actual restaurant portion of El Taurino, stood in line and ordered - 1 carne asada taco, 1 carne asada torta, and 1 carne asada nachos.  When our order was called the lady was about to give us 4 hot sauces, but got scolded at and had to TAKE BACK a sauce.  Ok, I can understand it being a down economy and all, but seriously?!?!  We didn't even get napkins so once we found a seat I went back and asked for napkins - they proceeded to hand me two skimpy napkins (there were 5 of us)... again, seriously!?!?!? Carne Asada Taco - good, but it was teeeeeensy.  The size of the taco takes about 2 bites and is the size of the palm of your hand - it was topped with lots of chopped onions and cilantro and meat on a fried corn tortilla though - lots of flavor here. Carne Asada Torta - my friends from Norcal would go out of their way just to get this so I couldn't wait to give this a shot.  According to them, it's the best torta in California - if only I could say the same.  The bread was sooo soggy and they totally skimped on the meat.  I found about 2 slices of avocado, lots of melted cheese, and tons of mayo in between two plain white buns.  Meh... maybe I came on a bad night, maaaybe. Carne Asada Nachos - crispy chips & what looked like cheez whiz topped with a meager amount of meat and onions.  I'm forever going to remember El Taurino as the most cheapskate restaurant ever!  First impressions are everything and my first impression of this place sucked!  The meat here was no good either - tough and chewy and dry on all 3 dishes... I've definitely had better.

I think I'm pretty hardcore.  At least about food.  Take for example, when I was 13 and had braces.  After one particularly grueling Saturday morning session of orthodonTORTUREy, where my orthodontist torqued the wires in my braces tighter than a g-string on a BBW stripper, my teeth were so sore that it hurt to drink soup during lunch.  I thought I was going to die of starvation as it usually took three days for the soreness to go away, and this seemed like it was going to take at least...forever. Imagine how much more depressed when I heard we were going to have my favorite dinner--steak with all the fixings, that night. BUT, I loved steak so much that when my mom put that T-bone down in front of me, I promptly picked up the steak knife and fork, and with pinky in the air, cut a healthy piece of medium rare, succulent piece of hearty-beef-its-what's-for-dinner meat and put it in my mouth.  I chewed as lightning bolts of pains shot through my body and tears streamed, like freshly melted snow from the Rockies during spring time, down my face. My mom thought those were tears of joy streaming down my face (bless her heart). Fast forward to this weekend.  It started on Saturday night and let's just say I caught a case of the, umm, "runs" (FYI: it wasn't a preparation for the half-marathon).  Suffered through Sunday and, as I powered through work (and working out*) on Monday, I still wasn't feeling any better.  But, when a couple of self-proclaimed cholas call me out to try El Taurino?  The landmark Mexican joint in Los Angeles?  Was I going to let some "minor" intestinal discomfort stop my roll?                  Hell-To-The-Sopes-No. Carne asada sopes with red sauce and a couple of cups of Bud Light; delicious and worth every bit of the searing pain from the rectal napalm bomb runs that were to follow.  And believe me, there were several.   My self-proclaimed cholas took a couple of bites of their respective burritos and tacos with the red sauce before having to switch over the mild green sauce they probably give to the kids and toddlers.  Ha!  Fakexicans!  They each did eat a roach coach's worth of food--I guess being "gangsta"--even if you're fakin' it, takes a lot of calories, 'cause they put that sh+t down. Looking forward to going back when the rest of my intestinal bacterial posse is rolling with me.  And when the two cholas lose the 10-lbs they gained there.  Could be a while. *I said hardcore, not intelligent.  I should have just worked from home.

After a night of alcohol debauchery in Los Angeles with your posse scoot yourselves over to El Taurino.. A late night out with these gorgeous men: Jack, Jim, Johnny, and Jose (I prefer not all at once) can sure tickle your taste buds for something...CHEAP Except...El Taurino..is a bit OVERRATED! Long lines..crowded spaces..a baloon making clown in the corner.. Sorry stud..but I'd rather chase taco trucks..actually more like stalk them around Los Angeles than to stand in line and wait 5 days for King Taco...whoops did I say that...? I meant El Taurino... Whatever...same difference... I must say though, their lengua and cabeza tacos...are a lot better than some of the ones I've had around town... for once acquiring some sort of marinated flavor and minus the overpowering taste of grease but after consuming...10,000 calories at the bar...(As IF! I was sooo not counting) what's a little bit of grease right?? While gorging on my cabeza and lengua taco...my imaginative brain starts ticking...and paranoid eyes wondering "Umm why are those bull heads staring at me?" ::Must be the guilt of eating lengua and cabeza:: but then ...I snap out of it..and think..I'm too much of a carnivore...to even care about these things...

Really?? How did I possibly miss Yelping one of my absolute favorite places in LA?? I pretty much always get the Carne Asada burrito. But when I first was introduced to El Taurino (by my parents :) ), I always had the tacos. I've also had the tostada, which is not a normal tostada! So don't expect the huge hard shelled bowl, it's just like a hard shell with everything on top of it. Still absolutely amazing though. Now the sauces. I'm Korean and I love my spicy food a lot.  I can handle it! I literally put Tabasco on EVERYTHING - my eggs, mixed with my ketchup for fries, sometimes even my pizza. But the red sauce (salsa roja) is damn spicy...and I love it! I'm so addicted to it. It's probably so bad for me, but it's just that good. But the green sauce (salsa verde) is also really good. It still has somewhat of a kick to it so you can eat a ton of it. They also have like a little truck outside of the actual place in the parking lot so if you're looking to just grab and go (or if the line gets super packed inside), definitely check it out!

I still love you even though you gave me food poisoning. I just won't be back as often. Maybe instead of 2 times a week, once a week or even every other week.

I felt a little uneasy sitting at a table waiting for my food.  I felt like someone was staring at me.  I couldn't shake the feeling.  My eyes dart around the room and all I see are Mexicans and Koreans.  But... nobody is looking at me.  Wtf?  Am I just paranoid??   Then I looked up.  Oh holy mother of jeebus, there's a big fat bull head staring at me.  Those large, extremely frightening eyes are taunting me, laughing at me because of the long line of patrons ahead of me waiting for their food.  Please!  Stop staring at me... I didn't do anything.  I'm just enjoying my horchata (mediocre) and waiting for my darn tacos.  I try to look away, but something about that bulls cabeza drove me loco.  I try to turn around as to not fixate on the monstrosity up ahead  and BAM!  Another cabeza de taurino.  AHH!!!! Pleaseeeeee let my people go.  Wtf, I happen to pick the table right smack in the middle of the two mounted bull heads.  It's going to be a long night. Well.  The wait wasn't pretty.  I kept hearing them rattle off numbers... seis... seis... wait that was six, I learned my numbers in spanish class wayyyyy back when.  BLAST the stupid microphone.  What the hell is she saying?  We sent the roommate up to wait.  Patiently, patiently.   Finally, what seemed like an eternity later, FOOD!  I got my al pastor and carnitas taco, in an effort to remain on a tight diet (haha who am I kidding, these diets last less than a minute).  Well two tacos is a good night, at least I exercised self control.  Let me just say from the items I ate and stole a bite (or two) from (burritos - carne asada and al pastor), skip the rest of the menu and go al pastor all the way.  Al pastor will definitely make you forget about the crazy cabezas staring at you.   What the smell is al pastor?  It's some secret sauce marinade of pork, rotisseried and cooked with pineapple on top.  At least that is what google tells me.  Otherwise, all I know was that I had a mouth full of delicious, definitely tasted some delicious grilled onions, some magic sauce with vinegary sweetness , and very tender pork.   Next time I'm driving back west from DTLA, I'll definitely make a pit stop to wait, wait, wait for al pastor tacos.  But maybe I'll pick seats away from the bull cabezas.

I'm fairly certain I've never eaten here sober. But a plate of El Taurino tacos while boozed tastes much more heavenly than any meal I've had at any Michelin-rated restaurant while undrunk. Much of the magic can be attributed to the famous red hot sauce. I never checked, but I believe they offer a less spicy sauce. Ask for that, however, and you will most likely get an angry visit from Xochiquetzal, the Aztec goddess of embroidery, who will promptly stab you with a scissor. So, bottom line: El Taurino is better than French Laundry. But don't just take my word for it. Here are actual messages I received from two friends whom I'd taken to El Taurino for their first times last week: "My stomach still reels from the burrito of death of Monday night. I hurt ... deep inside ..." - Roger "I shit six times from the hot sauce." - Alex

All these time...I was living in a world of lies!!! Whatever I had before, was not a real Torta!!! All lies!! After trying El Taurino's Carne Asada Torta and Al Pastor Torta with their magical green sauce I have finally encountered the True TORTA! (Read it in native Spanish pronunciation) Limit of 1 Sauce per order...I think that's stingy but it's understandable because their Green Sauce is magical

update. I always though El Taurino was really pricey, but after looking at the menu, my friend and I discovered that we've been ordering one of the most expensive items at El Taurino for the past 2 years. HAHAHAHA! Because we're poor college students, we decided to try something new...after eating all mean carne asada burritos for two years. We ordered the Torta and Tostada. I understand why people rave about it so much now. IT'S FREAKIN GOOD. And I've been over spending on burritos this whole time. *sigh* I mean, it's still muy delicioso...

I would like to think Asian-Americans have taken great strides in progressing as a community whether it be in art, entertainment and/or education. But when I go here, clearly, all that goes away. I been here twice and I see the most despicable Asian-Americans ever. I don't know how it is possible but it looks like every customer has managed to obtain the same "look." This look can be described as if they just recently lost a bar fight and they are celebrating their defeat with sub-par Mexican food. Honestly, it is a sea  of un-gelled hair, missing shirt buttons, running mascara, and the wonderful scent of soju and lemon drops. To summarize, the food isn't all that great. The atmosphere at night is even worse than the food. And to top it off, you have to wait a really long time. So, if you would like to eat below average Mexican food and enjoy it with some of the classiest Asian-Americans in the LA county, this is your spot. I'll be eating at Taco Bell. I heard they Chalupa just got upgraded...XXL, baby.

Stingy with their hot sauce and very poor service. Fyi this review is after coming here over 30+ times. The last time I came here I payed for extra hot sauce because I was so fed up with the workers attitude with previous visits.This time I asked for salsa verde (green sauce) and they gave me red sauce. The worker changed it but replaced the extra charge size with a small size. He refused to give me the size I payed extra for. My last bad experience there. Sounds one sided but I gave this place every chance because their food is good but there bad service has driven me away.

Rumor has it that El Taurino and King Taco are owned by the same company so no wonder why everything taste exactly the same! The menu is the same as King Taco's except El Taurino offers tostada's. Everyone has been raving about their tostada's so I decided to give it a try. Verdict: It's good but not something I would make the trip out for, its something you can definitely make at home. My opinion is the sopes are wayyyy better. But you have to give two thumbs up for El Taurino and King Taco's Salsa Verde, its soo addicting! So, if you have a King Taco in your neighborhood, save yourself some gas and go there!

So I went out on a (first) date with this guy last night and we were planning on getting Korean food as I am Korean and he apparently seems to like all things Korean. Somehow along the way we both decided we weren't in the mood for Korean food. Anywhoo.... he ends up taking me to El Taurino - after saying its the best place to get a burrito in LA. (I'm very skeptical about LA burritos because I dont' actually think LA can make good burritos - we're known for tacos. but I digress). So we get the restaurant/glorified taco stand and wait in line behind lots of people who obviously did not just get off of work like we did and order our burritos (fyi - I dont' understand why we have to tell them if we want onions, tomatos, beans, salsa blah blah blah condiment by condiment. It was the longest most intricate burrito order of my life).   We finally order and find a cute little booth in the back of the restaurant (the part that is decorated with gory pictures of bullfighting gone bad). And as we're trying to get through the "preliminaries" - mind you this man was SO unnecessarily nervous - b/c personally, I dont' think I'm a person to get nervous over. All we could hear was the loud (extremely loud) mariachi music blaring over the busted speaker - so really it was just a lot of static. AND every two minutes or so you could hear one of the employees calling out the order numbers rapid fire - in a former life they must've been auctioneers. The funny thing is - neither of us speaks Spanish so I had no idea if the order was ours. So my date spent 15 minutes waiting at the counter trying to figure out which was ours.. and I got to sit at the booth by myself "studying" the bull fighters and trying to ignore the creepy guy sitting in the booth in front of me.   Ok. so fast forward 15 minutes. We get our food (the burritos were tiny) and we're eating (I'm just trying to keep pieces of tomato from falling down my shirt...and all the while thinking "how can THIS be the best burritos in LA? Ugh. What was I thinking agreeing to come out here with this guy? Did he really just order an all-meat burrito? wow he eats really fast... hm creepy guy keeps staring... oh god. Just let me get out of here alive.." ) and "trying" to talk over the loudspeaker and the music... eventually we realize this just isn't going to work. So we finished the burritos and decided to leave. I dropped him off at home and the date was officially over in 1 hour. Moral of my story? 1) El Taurino is NOT a good date restaurant and definitely not a good 1st date restaurant and 2) Be sure NOT to wear v-neck shirts when you eat here oh. And the burritos were ok. Whereas my Diet Pepsi was excellent. So you think he'll call?

Tacos - I like them a lot. I like them especially around 2am after a night of drinking large quantities of alcohol. Now usually, I like to consume my post boozing tacos at nice little chain place which involves crowns and green salsa. But one night, a new friend of mine introduced me to a new taco place.  And like my new friend, this new place is gonna be in my repertoire for a while. First of all, you order inside.  Now, at the other place, I have to wait outside in front of God and East LA waiting for my food.  Here, amongst the abnormally large numbers of stylishly dressed Asian twenty somethings, one can await their food inside.  I like that a lot. Second of all, they sell beer.  I don't even have to explain why...but I like that a lot too. Lastly, I had the lengua and carne asada tacos.  The lengua had green salsa that, I swear to God, was just as good as that other place I used to go to for late night taco consumption.  Well well fucking well.   I also ordered a tamal de mole...which I knew wasn't going to be as good as the homemade kind I had just eaten days ago...but it wasn't bad.   But the tacos - I liked them a whole lot. So now, after finishing my round of bar hopping through downtown LA...I will be back at El Taurino.  Eating the tacos - I like them a lot.

Yout gotta be kidding me.  4 star average on YELP?  ZERO stars if I could. I dare this place to take on any Taqueria in San Francisco Bay Area and it will crash and burn. The burritos here regardless of regular or super are the SAME SIZE?! They're thin and have no heft to it.  I know Los Angeleans are watching their figure but my goodness at least adjust your pricing.   My friends said this was "the place" to go for a burrito.  They certainly dropped the ball on this one. We waited 20 minutes for our food.  A Taqueria should never take that long.  I was starving so I also ordered a taco to go along with my super burrito.  It was a complete let down.  The tacos were smaller than the $2 tacos specials in San Francisco.  I never knew tortillas could be made so small.  Did I mention how bad their burritos were? Its a problem when I can see layers of flour tortilla.  It was so thin and I wanted to order more but I couldnt bare waiting another 20 minutes for a sub standard burrito.  It literally was the size of the frozen ones you get at 7-11.  You know the one I'm talking about?  The packaging looks amazing but what you end up with is disappointment.  That was my experience at El Taurino. The carne asada was rubbery and the buche I had on my taco had no color? Wasn't it finished on a flat top griddle?  No self serve salsa station?  Oh man!  I couldn't wait to leave.  My first time giving a Taqueria a low rating.  Thank goodness its not in my home town.   LA, you can keep this joint. =P

Ive eaten here probably around 10x, all of which have been ~3am, and never with a BAL of less than 0.12% From my hazy recollection of the food, it definately fulfills your late night munchies!  But then again, I think anything decently edible will do at that ungodly hour.

Where to go after late night drinking downtown? MANY say El Taurino - so don't be surprised to find a FAT line at 3am! I went with a few friends after a night of drinking on a Saturday. There were tons of people in line for the truck outside as well as really long lines inside the restaurant. We opted for the truck since the line seemed to be shorter - plus you get your food right away. Ordered 4 tacos ($1.25 each) - carnitas, chicken, carne asada, and el pastor. The meat was very flavorful, tortilla was very soft, and the tacos had a nice overall spicy lime tang! Word of advice - don't touch your eyes after touching the taco.. -_- oh dear.. that hot sauce lingers!!! Would love to come back and try something different like thier burrito or tostadas :) No wonder this is everyone's favorite Mexican joint in LA!

It seems likes like December is the month of pigging out and eating lots of fried food for me. :P I think maybe it is because once January hits I gotta go onto the healthy side. I came here around 11:00 in the morning and this place was dead. I ordered the food and it pretty much came back instantly. I got the chili tamale and also a steak taco. The meat is pretty is good and has a lot of flavor. I never had a chili tamale in my life but I thought it tasted pretty good with cheese and chili. This place also has some pretty good sauces the spicy sauce is pretty pretty spicy and also they have a mild sauce which I think isn't that great but the spicy sauce is pretty damn good!! I will defiantly come back here to try more things and it is located pretty close to Downtown, JTown and the parking lot is quite big so it doesn't seem that bad. But than again I came pretty early. Also the inside is quite pretty with many pictures of bull fighting and bulls. :)

Remember the first time you had a taco that wasn't covered in neon cheese and stuffed with (is it or isn't it) beef? It's kind of like that moment where you realize that the cheap plastic toy within a Happy Meal isn't worth the shriveled hamburger and move onto Big Macs and away from the golden arches altogether. Anyways, El Taurino is really what a taco should be about. Quick, cheap and definitely beefy. This place is really all about the meat, soft corn tortillas and some spicy sauce that will make your lower digestive organs hate you for the next two days. For $1.25 you can have any bit of cow, pig or chicken enveloped in warm tortillas and down your gullet in 5-10 mins flat. The beef items (cabeza, lengua, carne asada...etc) are definitely worth repeated visits as I found the pork and chicken to be bland and forgettable. Definitely recommend being clear and concise with your order because you could end up with with an undressed naked taco or a garden of cilantro and onions. Only a couple of things keeps this place from being five stars and that is the lack of a free for all salsa/condiment bar and the sore absence of seafood options. I know, wah wah. AH! Also, beware the cheese! Which happens to be hunks of unmelted, processed salty mozarella.

I would pimp my sister for el Taurino's tacos. I would. You'd think that I would stay away because my uncle got stabbed here, but the tacos are SO good that I can't not go back. El taurino has their ordering system down to a science. You order your food at one counter and you pick up at several different assembly stations. Nestled beteen Koreatown and the Pico-union El Taurino is usually a nice mix of Koreans and latinos with a generous helping of white people. The decor isn't amazing but the level of cleanliness is above average for Mexican restaurants and there is plenty of seating. El taurino is open super late, which is also a plus. I ordered the carne asada tacos and they are TO DIE FOR. Best tacos ever. I commented to my date that you can either get stabbed at El Taurino for great tacos or shot at King taco. Those are my two favorite spots for Mexican short of going to Mexico. There is plenty of parking, and due to its reputation for unsavory elements usually has at least 3 security guards on duty. Their horchata is bomb. I'm a horchata snob and this place kicks ass. I'm bringing my nalgene bottle next time and filling up.

El Taurino is a great place to go for your post drinking. It is always very crowded early mornings following a club night. There aren't too many places to eat at that hour. For us the usual places are: *Carnitas Michoacan (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) *King Taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) *El Taurino. I personally prefer either El Taurino or King Taco. The carne asada at El Taurino is very good. I usually order the Carne Asada Burrito (pura carne, all meat). It is very good. The meat is very tender and juicy. I also like the quesadilla with carne asade. My friends like eating nachos. The nachos here are average. Some of my friends actually like the nachos at Carnitas Michoacan better. I guess it depends on personal preference. I think the meat at El Taurino is superior and both use nacho cheese. The cheese at El Taurino is thicker while Carnitas Michoacan is more watery (which make it soggy).  I prefer to stick with the tacos and burritos. Overall El Taurino is a decent taco place. To be honest I haven't found Mexican Food in LA quite as good as some places further south (Orange County or San Diego). Given the options in LA I would say El Taurino or King Taco are the better options.

This place is pretty good when you're sober, but a gastronomical orgasm when you're drunk. The secret is in the sauce.... the salsa roja that is. If you would like to try something different besides the usual tacos and burritos, do try the milanesa torta. Its like a big fat Mexican style fried pork rind sandwich. *drooool* note: If you are a newbie, you may want to take it easy with the salsa, otherwise your butthole will have a burning sensation the next time you do number 2. o_O

Los Tigres del Norte. Two Thirsty Thursdays ago, at the end of our bar hopping night and after copious amounts of alcohol, we were all hungry.  Various suggestions were made until Anthony put his foot down and settled the food conundrum. It was off to El Torito we went...well at least I thought that's what he said.  And since it was 3am and our options were limited, I wasn't about to argue...besides, I was pretty surprised that there was an El Torito even open that late. 10, 15 minutes later and there we were turning into the parking lot El Taurino.  Ohhhhhhhhhh.  El Taurino!!!! El Taurino is located in Pico-Union right smack in the middle of the Olympic, Hoover and Alvarado trifecta...on 11th street to be exact.  A locals joint to be sure with a menu that will satisfy even the most discerning Mexican food enthusiast.  Tortas, pork, burritos, carne asada, tacos, chicken, tostadas, tongue...it's all there.  Good sized portions with incredible taste at wallet friendly prices. El Taurino is a large restaurant that even at 3am had a line of people waiting to order their stomach easing meal.  While mostly latino, there was a good amount of Koreans from the neighboring Koreatown.  They were all there for the same thing...to eat and to eat well. I left happy after chowing down my torta de carne asada and taco de pollo.   Plenty of parking, late hours, good food...El Taurino for the win.  Oh yeah, make sure you put a couple of bucks into the Jukebox and play some banda for the locals. ****Cash only.

I was feeling nostalgic.  I haven't been to El Taurino in ages so I thought I'd make a trip for some eats.   Maybe I should have gone at 2am after a hard night's drinking to fully cure my nostalgia.... maybe the food would have tasted better as well. What happened?! This was a serious disappointment and its definitely quantity over quality anymore.  (The salsa is still hot and yummy tho) 3 stars because they're cheap, open 24hours, and maybe on a good day you can get decent tacos/burritos again.

Dear El Taurino, I've loved you since high school. As the years have passed, I have forgiven you for many things. 1. The longer lines 2. Being stingy with the hot sauce 3. The extra charges from a quarter to the now 90 cents per hot sauce. 4. General increase in price But my last visit was the last straw. How dare you charge me $6.57 for an all carne burrito the size of a taco bell soft taco? I was still starving and upset after I scarfed it down in 3 bites. It still tastes delicious but its like having a fantastic lover that finishes too early. I will be only going to King taco from now on. BOOOOO for being stingy with the massive increase in business!!!

R.I.P. my poor tongue. and that's not a bad thing... it's because their hot sauce is WOW. I had a burrito, and while it didn't seem like the hot sauce was too bad, it kinda snuck up on me with each bite. By the end of the meal, my whole mouth was on fire. It was a GOOD fire though, as the burrito was very bueno. Comparable to Taco Sinaloa, the food was really good. The burritos are stuffed with a ton of stuff, rice, beans, meat, veggies... I even saw a few peas in there!! very yummy, and very filling.  Just beware of their EXCELLENT, but hot hot hot sauce. I also like their guacamole, VERY hot as well. I believe the green green color is because of the ground up jalapenos they put in it. I enjoy their carne asada quesadilla, but what REALLY takes the cake is their tostada. Served on a flat fried tortilla, they pile it high with carne asada, avocada, tomato, onions, and goat cheese. I find myself craving their tostadas every week. They are so freakin delicious, words can't even describe. SO GOOD holy crap. mmmmmmmm...

El Taurino would easily be a five star joint if it was not stingy on portions and condiments. Since when was there a ration on the amount of sauce that a customer needs to enjoy their meal? Some people might think its a good business tactic...I think not. El Taurino's sauce is AMAZING. Super spicy and super delicious..you won't find it anywhere else. I consider myself a mexican-Korean..meaning, I LOVE MEXICAN FOOD, and I adore this sauce. My friends swear by it. The food is very good as well..my favorite so far has been the al pastor tacos and tortas. The horchata brings me back to the first time I had tried horchata at my friend's quincenera. Yeah, this place might be packed and they might not give you the ginormous portions you are used to getting from Robertos, etc..but you will definitely enjoy your meal here.

No longer worth the time. I used to be a big fan of their tacos, sopes and tamarindos but the food just doesn't taste the same anymore...  The fact that they now take 30 minutes plus to make 4 tacos doesn't help, and I'm not even talking about when the place is super crowded.

Ever since i was a little girl, i have always been traumatized by the tostada.   You see, the grade school i attended served tostadas every Wednesdays and every Wednesday i always had to remind myself  to bring lunch the following Wednesday.   But each Tuesday night i would forget and would arrive to school every wednesday without a brown paper bag in tow.  O how i was jealous of those kids with their lunch pails and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.   My dreaded Wednesday lunch would consist of  store bought tortilla disc, re fried beans, chopped lettuce, ground up meat (if we were lucky ),  couple dices of tomatoes and a sprinkle of imitation cheese...it was horrible!    Now when i see tostadas on a menu i always am reminded of horrible institutional food i was a served as a child week after week. Until, I attended a wedding the other day with my best friend Grey, last name Goose, (the best date a woman could ask for).   After the party had stopped all the attendants  (well most of the cool ones at least)  voted to go to El taurino.  I had been here on numerous occasions and always got the same thing the carne asada taco, al pastor taco, or  one of the sopes with the green and or red sauce (not as hot as it's parent company king taco's)... This time , trying to hold my nausea in, i saw my friend ordered the very same thing that tormented me as a child... only this time it had a make over.  Flat tortilla disc right out of the fryer, tons of carne asada, white crumbly cheese, a slice of tomato, pickled onions,  the creamiest avocado and dollop of sour cream.  If I  wasn't so nauseous....i would've seriously fought him for it.     Since, i didn't get to have any the night before i returned the next evening...hung over and all.   So after, 2 tostatadas and al pastor taco later...its safe to say  the horror of the tostada will no longer haunt me again.   It was anything and everything i was dreaming about night before (while hugging the porecalin throne).

You know how you scout out for some taco truck?  Well this is a taco truck in a store! :)  This is the best Mexican food in the area.  It is always packed and the parking sucks, but it is worth the wait.  They have a variety of foods such as sopas, tacos, burritos, etc.. so you'll find something you will like there.  Trust! :)   Plus! they are the same as King Taco, so if you like King Taco, you'll love El Taurino. Enjoy!

When I began my historic quest for the best taco shops in San Diego, my good friend Raihan scoffed at me and invited me to an El Taurino field trip. Though I can't disavow San Diego taco shops/trucks like Ray wants me to, I can certainly sing the virtues and praises of El Taurino. I've never had better barbacoa. The carnitas was solid as a rock. The hot sauce jolted me, a rarity for this Irish-Russian genetic fluke who can tolerate 9s at most Thai places. If not the heat, then the extreme flavor. I've been here once, which means I'm violating a well-respected rule of mine. I try to only write reviews for restaurants I've been to several times, because I think it's only fair to the owners to catalogue a wide sampling of their offerings. In this case, it's not necessary. El Taurino rules. Why not 5 stars, you say? I still believe that "As good as it gets" means just that, and for the twenty minutes I waited for my three street tacos and the 100 degree heat inside the shop, I just can't bear giving away my fifth star. Buy some AC. You have enough loyal customers, Taurino. Seriously.

Yes, the food is tasty and authentic--I got the carnita tostada and thought it was cool how there was a thick slice of tomato added to the mix too. Or maybe my mind and stomach thought the food tasted so good because I waited so long for it to come out. My friend from Australia and I ordered a tostada and burrito, and it was close to an hour before we were able to eat. In short: Great food and price; Ridiculous waiting time (when I went, which was on a Sunday night in July). Also, the lines and pick-up system are a bit confusing

Expect a hefty line here. Open late for a late-night craving GET THE TOSTADA with the hot sauce on the side. Tried my fair share of tacos, burritos, sopas, etc, but the tostada is TOP NOTCH. Warning: don't leave the tostada in the car or take it to-go for someone else because it will stink up your car with garlicy goodness. But, seriously, I don't know why but it smells like a**?!

Note to self: Plenty of parking spots, it should be very easy to park close to the restaurant provided one enters the parking lot from the entrance and not the exit. Firsts on this late evening: * Tamarindo - which is an agua fresca drink from Mexican cuisine, hailing from primarily the southernmost Tamarindo region of Mexico, which is known for their lovely Tamarindo trees and fine pharmaceutical grade coca plants. * Lengua - which I am told is the tongue region of the cow, however despite this fact I thought it to be pretty damn good.  As it was introduced to me, I now forward this gift on to you, the Yelper, in order to complete the circle of lengua. Not a typical late night spot, the food is definitely above par, the Carne Asada tacos were magically delicious, overall a 4.25 stars.  (I'm still tasting hot sauce when I burp...)

This used to be one of my favorite late-night, after-clubbing food joints, I swear.  Anyone that called out, "Let's go to El Taurino!" got "Hip hip hooray"s from me.  I used to love their carne asada tacos and their tostadas, with their FIRE HOT red and green sauces.  Seriously, I love my food SPICY, and this place has sauce that will set any tongue burning.  Oh, how I miss it so. Unfortunately, one HORRIBLE incident caused me to boycott this place forever and ever.  As much as I loved the yummy food, I just can't find it in my heart to return ever again.  I feel like I lost a limb, but in a necessary, life-saving procedure. Approximately a year ago was when I quit El Taurino.  It was a beautiful afternoon, and my BFF and I were in Koreatown to run some errands.  We usually only went to El Taurino at 3am, when it was jam-packed with drunken party-goers looking for a bit of fire to wake them up from their stupor.  The lines were incredibly long, seats were hard to come by (you had to stand by and watch with a hawk's eye to nab a table as soon as someone left), and the food was slow to arrive. Now, being there in the afternoon, we were afforded a unique opportunity to indulge in our favorite foodstuffs sans the disgusting lines and wait times!  So we bustled on over to Hoover and Olympic, and there we were.  El Taurino. We parked the car (we'd never seen the lot so empty!), and we hurried on in, drooling at the prospect of hot, savory carne asada drowned in ridiculously spicy sauce (my mouth is actually watering right now at the very thought).  Surprisingly, there was still quite a line at the restaurant (surprising, as it was too late for lunch and too early for dinner), but we felt it was just a testament to how popular the place was. We had been in line for a few minutes, inching closer and closer to the cashier.  In fact, we had just inched our way past the doorway to the right of the cashier.  I was busy perusing the menu for the millionth time, trying to decipher the menu with my rusty Spanish.  All of a sudden, my BFF grabs my arm with a death grip and hisses into my ear, "OMFG, MOVE!" "Huh?" I asked, confused. "Don't look!  Just MOVE!" she hissed again. Of course, as soon as she said, "Don't look," I cocked my head to the right to look.  Lighting fast reflexes and all that. It was only for a brief second, but I instantly registered exactly why she so urgently pressed me to move. There, chilling in a manner most relaxed, as if it freaking lived there and was unbothered by the humans milling in its general vicinity, was a GIANT COCKROACH.  Oh my, I shudder at the mere memory. There, on the metal door frame that lines the Hoover-side entrace, was the biggest cockroach I had ever seen in my life.  I swear up and down that it was at LEAST the size of my thumb!!! Suppressing a horrible urge to scream (we didn't want to startle the cockroach and cause it to MOVE, if you know what I mean), we crab-walked to the other side of the restaurant, and as soon as we reached the restroom area, we bolted for the back door and into the safety of our car. Of course, we spent a few minutes screaming and gagging over what we had just witnessed.  A GIANT COCKROACH!!!  The rumors were true!  The place WAS infested by vermin! It took awhile for us to regain our wits, but when we finally did, a truly unsettling realization dawned upon us.  Certainly, a cockroach sighting in any eating establishment is enough to make our stomachs churn.  But the truly shocking truth was, once we were calm enough to assess the situation, NO ONE SEEMED TO CARE. I KNOW for a fact that when my BFF and I started to crabwalk in the opposite direction of the doorway, several heads turned to see what the heck we were freaking out about.  They glanced at us and then turned their heads the other way to see what had scared us so, and there was NO WAY any of them could miss the MOTHER OF ALL ROACHES chillin' on the door frame! Yes, folks.  The TRULY disgusting fact is that NO ONE CARED.  As if it was NORMAL.  Yuck! Blech! Ick!!! I think.. perhaps... if the employees had caused a ruckus after seeing the cockroach, at least making a show of trying to kill it and acting disgusted, I might have been able to console myself and say, "Well, there may be roaches, but they do their best to get rid of them."  Instead, I now think to myself, "They must be so used to the roaches that no one gives a rat's ass." GROSS! Sad to say that I feel like I lost my favorite dive joint.  As much as I loved the food, I just can't stomach the thought of ever eating there again. Yuck! Blech! Ew! Ick! Gag! Foul! Nasty!  What else can I say?

I walked by here a few times and could not believe my good luck in living down the street from such a cool restaurant.  The people watching is almost as good as the food.  Groups of Mexican ladies in tight outfits, long dyed hair, big earrings,  each with a large horchata, picking away at their tortas and tacos.  Mexican construction dudes, throwing back a few beers with a burrito.  Asians, skinny fobby ones, skinny Americanized ones, huddled over their fares and talked quietly to each other.  Good looking professional men and women, the women with heels just a little too high and skirts a little too tight, looking like something out of a telenovela, deep in discussion. Big windows, a cool 67 degrees on the thermostat, bull heads hanging from the walls,  pictures of svelte men in tight pants showing off their perky booties.  I don't know what more anyone could ask for. Oh and the food was pretty good too.

Tacos al pastor are marinated over one or two days with a blend of different spices and herbs and then slowly cooked on a vertical rotisserie.  When ready, the meat is then thinly sliced off the rotisserie. What I had at El Taurino was not tacos al pastor.  God knows what it is I ate at El Taurino, but it wasn't tacos al pastor.  The meat, which should have been juicy and succulent, rich with color and an aroma to die for, was actually grayish, and lacking any flavor at all - which is actually quite remarkable how they were able to do that, come to think of it.  The taste and consistency is memorable, only because it leaves a, simply put, unappetizing flavor in your mouth..... The kitchen is viewable from the dining area in El Taurino, so I got to see them take out huge bags of frozen meat (think of the frozen fry bags that you see at fast food restaurants), beat it until the clumped pieces of meat became dangled, then throw it onto the grill.  Sometimes transparency isn't a good thing.  Yet, still explanatory of the food that is output. Besides the two tacos al pastor I also got carne asada nachos.  Nachos.  Should be hard to screw up, right?  Somehow El Taurino stepped up to the plate and hit a homerun.  Instead of grated cheese, which is actually quite common at most Mexican restaurants, they used nacho cheese.  Yes, nacho 'velveeta-ish' cheese.  No, nacho cheese isn't supposed to be used on these types of nachos.  Nacho cheese is to be employed when you're at a baseball game or concert.  Out of sheer necessity and time constraints, you can't grate cheese at that sort of venue so instead you have a nacho cheese dispenser.  If you're at a restaurant, not unlike El Taurino, you're not supposed to use nacho cheese!  You grate the cheese over the nachos, cook it for a few minutes, throw on the carne asada and bask in the glory that is the symphony of corn tortilla, fresh cheese and meat.   This is not true Mexican food.  Arguably, it barely qualifies as food. If you're in the area, hold out for something better, like a taco truck up the street or travel a few miles down to koreatown.  If you must eat something, stop at a nearby liquor store and buy some Doritos to tie you over till you can get something better.

After hearing much boasting from Gene L. and Andy C. they felt it was time to take Noreena M. and myself for the best Mexican this side of the border. Located in the seediest part of K-town, this is not a spot I would venture to at 1:00 am. Although after eating the Al Pastor you might be tempted to gamble with your life and chance it anyways. Yes the Pastor here is that good. It has to be by far the best I've had, and for a gringo, guerro, or pendejo or what ever you want to call me, I know my Pastor! This spot has 'em all beat, King Taco might as well change their name to Queen Taco... cause its been dethroned...no joke! You walk into the place and it doesn't look like much, just your typical Mexican spot. But this place is way more crowded, even on a Sunday afternoon at 2:00. That gives you a tip off as to how good the food is. The Barbaquoa is one of the dishes that its known for. My boy Gene polished a whole plate off by himself and was sweating profusely while he ate it. Pretty impressive how much hot sauce he went thru. I shared the Al Pastor burrito w/cheese, Carne Asada Torta and 2 Carnitas Tacos. The Burrito and Tacos were excellent, the Torta I wasn't feeling really. But I sure was feeling it afterwards when my stomach was in pain as I laid hoveled over feeling as if something was gnawing away at the lining of my stomach. Thus knocking this review down to 4 stars. When I go back I'm just going to stick with the burritos and tacos. I think my stomach will thank me for it.

After a late night out one evening, my friends were like "Let's go to El Taurino. It's the best ever!". Huh? What's this place you speak of? I've lived at USC for 4 years and had never even heard of this place, let alone having gone there before. We get there at like 2:30AM and there are at least thirty 40-year-old locals decked out with cowboy hats gathered around the El Taurino roach coach outside, and a packed restaurant inside with so many different types of people. Jackpot. I don't think you can get any more authentic than that. The food is great and man, that hot sauce is killer. I think the regulars get a kick out of watching the newbies try it, naively pouring too much onto the tiny tacos, and then proceeding to sweat profusely and having to down some horchata to save their lives.

El Taurino is a MUST in these neck of the woods. i've been to King Taco... and while it's delicious--- everyone will rave about this place. it's also funny because all the kids who beg to take me here are Koreans. they are some die-hard El Taurino fans! the red sauce is fire. it's the final touch to any dish. from the Carne Asada Burrito, Tostadas, Torta, etc... are all winners.  give me a Horchata and i'm a happy girl. trust me, it lessens the burning in your mouth from the hot sauce! haha.

Since when do you find good 24 hour food joints that can fulfill your sober AND drunken cravings? It doesn't happen too often for me but I finally had a chance to experience the El Taurino hype that my west coast friends always spoke of, and my east coast friends were fiends for. After all of our drunken adventures throughout Koreatown, we all had the drunchies (drunk munchies) and weren't quite ready to go home yet.  El Taurino was perfect. Still open (always open for that matter), close by, served delicious food, was cheap, and it was a spot for us to all settle down. We got there, and there was already a line of people?! Well, good thing they've learned to work with crowds so I knew this was no problemo. I got up front, ordered my 3 carne asada tacos, and a large horchata.  My order was called and the server asked me if I wanted red or green sauce.  Of course my natural decision was to go with the spicier one--RED IT IS.  2 minutes later--my mouth is burning and the senses on my tongue have gone numb...I forgot that my taste buds are amplified 100x when I'm drunk...and the red sauce didn't help.  Not saying it was bad because it was delicious...but just keep in mind it's spicier than the hot sauce at your average Mexican food spots.  Nothing a little horchata couldn't fix anyway.  Overall, $1.25 tacos and a $1.89 drink--cheap no? I was happy with my meal, it didn't beat up my wallet, and it's got my back at any hour of the day. What more can you ask for?

WHAT"S WITH THE FREAKIN' LINE HERE???? Man, I love me some burrito but the service here is just so painfully BAD! It's not their fault- the layout is just FUBAR'ed! Even when you phone your order in, it still takes 30 minutes or more! The workers are really nice to you when you attempt to speak en espanol. Try your best and watch them laugh. Chicken tostadas are to DIE FOR here. They do it right with the crema and crumbly queso on top with avocado slices. The burritos are pretty good too. Al pastor for me since I am a fan of the greeeezy food. I always order extra sauce on the side. It costs $1.50 for a small foam container of DEADLY. It's one of the best hot sauces ever made. Damn this line! Damn it to hell.

I have some friends who swears this place is different from King Taco, whether King Taco's meat is tastier or El Taurino's red sauce is hotter. After doing some research (in research, I mean going to the King Taco website's restaurant locator...yeaa I'm lame), I found out they're the exact same thing. El Taurino is the same thing as King Taco (same branch). So, with that said...I love this place! Yea, the prices seem ridiculous for how much food you get, and the workers there seem to wake up on the wrong side of bed every morning... BUT, when you crave El Taurino/King Taco, there's honestly nothing else that can satisfy it. And simply for being absolutely delicious, both the meat and the yummy red hot sauce, I give it a four. Also, I think I read someone's review that hated on the nachos, and I know it's very simple, but when you have their carne asade with chips and nacho cheese, and of course their hot sauce, you don't need anything else. It's that good.

Why do I always do this to myself??  I know I'm gonna feel like crap in the morning, yet I can never say no when friends suggest a trip to El Taurino after a night of partying in LA.  The food is just too amazing to pass up!  Now I'm Yelp-ing at 3:15 a.m. in a poor attempt to digest before knocking out... I Like: *Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had.  (Rice/bean/cheese burrito with a side of jalepenos...heaven.) *SPICY hot sauce (makes me cry all the time, but I just can't stay away!) I Hate: *How I feel the next morning. *The long lines and the long wait for your food. *CREEPERS.  It's pretty uncomfortable if you go with only girls... 5 stars nonetheless, because the amazing food is worth putting up with the long wait and the creepers that will without a doubt be there breathing down your necks.

My Review of El Taurino went from a 5 to a 2 over the past 3 years I've been coming here and here's why. Everyone talks about how GOOD El Taurino is. However, people should talk about how good El Taurino USED to be. I came here several times and the lines are terrible, the staff are inefficient, charge for every little ingredient, overpriced, and meat quality decreased. Good: 1) Tostada - AMAZING 2) Hot sauce - don't ask for more hot sauce because they'll get mad at you and try to charge you. Bad: 1) Burritos - the amount of meat and rice has decreased significantly while the price increased. 2) Torta - amount of meat decreased as well as increased in price. The only reason I liked this place before was because I just got out of the club and had the drunken munchies. At that point, everything is delicious. If you're trying to come here for lunch or dinner. I don't recommend it because there are soooo many places in LA where they offer cheaper Mexican food that is just as good.

Stay away from everything but the Sopes and the Al Pastor Burrito(delicious) In fact, stay away from those too, they cook slow enough as it is. Update* Gone back for a few more times..(once a week).  It gets an upgrade to 4stars  for the quesadilla.  I cook mine w/ Oaxacan but the Asadero quesadilla is fantastic.  Nice and oily to clog my arteries and shorten my life. Slowest mexican taco stand in the world. Takes over 35 minutes late night to get a few tacos.

Tastewise, they are good. But damn, the last few times I've gone, their burritos are looking more like taquitos and the price just goes up. Plus, these people are the rudest and slowest people you will ever deal with.  How long does it take to make a (expletive) burrito or tostada or whatever!  I've waited nearly an hour for a burrito (or should I say soft-shelled taquito) before.  The quickest I've gotten my food was about 15 minutes and there wasn't that many people in front of me.  Seriously, something is wrong with these people. I thought they were just racist, but when I asked my Mexican friends about the service they've received, they said they get the same so El Taurino doesn't discriminate.  They are just rude to all. Seriously, improve your damn service and your workers' (expletive) attitudes El Taurino!  Teach your employees how to smile at least (bleep).  Bad customer service makes food taste bad.

Me and a few friends stopped in while driving through LA. Never seen so many Asians in a Mexican taco joint before, it was a bit unsettling at first.  Like an episode of the Twilight Zone.   Being my first time I somehow ended up in the pick-up line rather than the order line for a good 5 minutes before I realized it. I felt like such a gringo.   The menu was big so I opted for what I knew, a carne asada burrito with all the fixins. I think somehow something got lost in translation because all I got was meat in my burrito. I shouldv'e finished my rosetta stone course on "ordering in spanish". Oh well, I just doused that mofo in hot sauce and that was that.  It was good, not great. The cheap pitcher of beer was a lifesaver though. Bud Light never tasted soo good. It was decent but I wasn't impressed, I certainly wouldn't drive up to LA just to have it but it's definitely a great option for the herd of late night drunkards. I'll probably get lynched for my 2 star review but I'm probably the only person that's tried this place sober.

Hands down better than King Taco.  Meat tastes the same, but the menu is so much bigger... and more importantly, they have the TOSTADAS!!!!  my most favorite item next to the nachos. the only thing you need to know is:  CARNE ASADA.  same as king taco, has the lime zing to it. tacos are cheap enough to get a few of different meats just to try... but you need to try the tostadas... its a flat hard shell tortilla on the bottom, stopping with meat, then slices of avocada, then i think even sour cream.  Add the red hot sauce to it, and youre in heaven! LIKES:  tostadas, carne asada anything, nachos. DISLIKES: GHETTO area.. parking sucks.. clientele depending on time might suck... and theyre open late with most of ktown coming here after drinking... so prepare for either fighting or general rowdy crowd. VERDICT: Better than King Taco.  Beware the red hot sauce which will creep into your ass.... YOGA FLAAAAAMMMMEEE!!!!!

My mouth is watering as I write this review even though I already had El Taurino twice in less than a week :X The first time I ever went to El Taurino, I questioned how good this place could be, but that doubt was quickly zapped away after I inhaled their tacos!  After that one visit, I've been coming here for years and I've never been disappointed. I first started off "safe" by trying carne asada tacos, but quickly moved on to their burritos, nachos, sopes, tostadas, and tortas! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE TAMALES -___- It was way too dry and I guess they cook it earlier in the day because the steam didn't make the outer layer that good either. But aside from the tamales, their al pastor (shepard pork?) and carne asada never fails to amaze me!  I have tried carnitas, buche, lengua, etc. but I tend to favor the al pastor and carne asada meat. I can't believe I took that long to discover how good a torta is!  It's basically a hamburger/sandwich with avocado, lettuce, tomato, choice of meat yum yum yum! The tostada is a flat crispy tortilla with thin spread of beans, sour cream, cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and meat YUM!! I to-go-ed it one time, but it got soggy on my drive back home so devour it right when you get it! The service is friendly, and prices are good but they add up fast because I order so much! Ask for the red salsa on the side!!  It's pretty dang spicy, but it's like they put crack in it cuz it's so addicting and good even if it feels like your tongue is gonna fall off from the spiciness! If you can't handle spicy, opt for the green salsa, which is good too! GO TO EL TAURINO NOW!! :)

El Taurino gets an extra star for being open late and tasting delicious after a few drinks.  I've only been a couple times, but I imagine I'll keep going as long as I have late nights in Los Angeles. The place gets busy, and the clientele is almost entirely Asian and Latino, and probably 90% Korean and Mexican.  I mean, scroll through the reviewers on Yelp.  Sure, there's the stray white guy, but for the most part?  Yellow and brown.  It makes sense.  El Taurino - or as my Korean mother knows it, "Hoover Taco" - is pretty close to Koreatown, home to lots of Koreans and Mexicans. The restaurant is pretty spacious and as a bonus, it has a huge parking lot.  The decor is colorful and kitschy and very casual, and there's plenty in the way of uncomfortable fast food seating.  You order at a window and pick up before you sit.  The menu is vast and the food is cheap. Some of it is delicious.  I love the carne asada torta, a satisfying sandwich with cheese, avocado, mayo, tomato, and onion accompanying savory flavorful meat in a soft bun.  It's a simple sandwich made with ingredients that are probably not top shelf, but with some hot sauce, it really hits the spot.  The carne asada burrito is similarly tasty, with plenty of beans and rice and a decent tortilla.  Again, add some hot sauce or that lovely salsa verde and you're in business.  I also enjoy the tostadas, which offer some great crunch in addition to the meat and grated cheese and vegetables.  Another surprisingly great item is the cheese quesadilla.  It's a big portion and it comes with gooey funky cheese melted into warm tortilla, and on the side is a spicy guacamole that I'd like to eat with everything. I've also tried to sope and the tamale, and wasn't a fan of either.  The sope came with little shreds of carne asada, but mostly strips of lettuce on a corn cake that left me unimpressed.  I like my sopes to have a little crisp on the outside with chewy corny insides, and this one lacked character.  The tamale, which was from King Taco, tasted nice enough, but it was dry.  Of course, both items were improved by salsa, but I have one more complaint - why is there a charge for extra sauce? Quibbles aside, I love El Taurino.  Whether that love is contingent on a spike in my BAC, I may never know.

Had to restart a new yelp account, old was deleted. This review is an old review for the carne asada, carbeza burrito NOT tacos. I here other places have better tacos. As far as burrito, to this day I still haven't had one better than this place. This and king taco are pretty close to the best burritos I've had in LA. I'm still waitin to try el chato taco truck which I hear is great for tacos and quesadillas.

While everything tastes the same when you are drunk, I know a bad taco when I see it. The sauce was friggin spicy to the point of ridiculousness and the meat was just okay quality. And the wait... the wait is just terrible.

My LA homies swear this is the best Mexcan food in LA, so I had to give it a try.  I had 4 tacos, a carne asada quesadilla, and the all meat burrito.  Overall, it was very good Mexican food, but nothing to write home about.  I feel like I could have gotten similiar quality anywhere in LA or the Bay. The prices are dirt cheap though.  And the green and red salsas were very delicious.  Apparently they serve a real good tostada, which I didn't get to try. And all the Mexican families that were there ordered some sort of meat platter.  I guess I'll have to go back.  Oh, the wait was kind of brutal.  Went there late Sunday night and still waited over 30 minutes for our food.

So I've been going to this joint for about ten years.  I used to come here after going kclubbing (illegally) as a early morning (i.e. 2 AM) snack.   Anyhow, went back recently and the only things that have changed are the styles of their menus and that they now charge for their hot sauce.  Yet, here is some advice:  The King Taco that is only two blocks away still does not charge for their hot sauce.  It's important because I definitely go through their hot sauce.  Man, in my opinion, it's legendary!  I still enjoy their carne asada tacos/ sopes and their tacos al pastor.... Good times...good times indeed!

So I finally dragged the hubby here last week and man oh man was I disappointed. The tacos are more expensive than what we are used to paying There was a line of maybe 4 people ahead of us and we waited for our turn for maybe twelve minutes. We then proceeded to wait an additional 35 minutes for our order to be called. It was so packed inside we decided to go to the car to eat the tacos there. The tacos were good, not great. And of course.. only one hot sauce, no lime slices, no salt packets... nada! His milanesa and avocado torta was dry and bad and the sauce was soooooo spicy it made the tacos unedible. This used to be my favorite spot for carne asada tacos but unfortunately it looks like we are going to venture elsewhere in search of the best tacos. Two Stars! (and only because even though the sauce was hot as hell... the hubby actually liked it)

To: "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" by Nefarious Stepped into El Taurino, with a blank slate of mind Bull busts on the walls, with not a speck of grime The kitchen was open, and that I do like Cause when clean is in question, don't care if it tastes aight. I found it kinda funny, a dude standing guard When I took some pictures, stared me down long and hard Shook his head and told me I couldn't snap no pics But took a few just cause I don't give a sh*t. Ordered up my food, a classic plate indeed One chix tamale & two carne tocks for me Came back with some salsa one red and one green Spicy as hell, the other tangy and pristine Tamale real fluffy, can say, pretty dope And the carne meat, spiced, sh*t ain't no joke Overall, I'd say the food was pretty damn bomb, For cheap, real good, cause I ain't got a job Despite the fact that I had a smile on my face This place gets no love, a hella big shame. For every lil' thing, you get nickle and dimed No water on tap, and a quarter for each lime No agua available, and hella spicy food? Sounds like straight upselling crookery dude. So with that, I don't want to seem like i'm cheap But it's two oh oh ten, I assume tap should be free.

DELICIOUS al pastor! Really, that's what it comes down to! The place is a bit sketchy, the service is non-existant, and I definitely can't say there's ANY ambiance. But the tacos will change the way you think about tacos. The carne asada is great but go straight for the al pastor. Crispy, chewy, and flavorful -- just the way it should be! Go easy on the salsa though because it will have you sweating and wishing you had a giant horchata. And if a taco ain't your thing the tostadas are DELICIOUS. My usual combo of one taco al pastor con todo and un tostada de carnitas is like a perfect little miracle in my mouth!!! And to make it even better the beers are $1.75 a glass or $5 for a pitcher. True, they only have bud and miller but who cares when it's this cheap and your tongue is ON FIRE?

Came here tonight and ordered 4 tacos (3 carne asada, 1 .. pork whatever it's called in spanish) and 1 tostada (shredded beef). The tacos are $1.25 each, and the tostada was $3.50. I got a regular sized raspberry iced tea with it which was kinda watered down. Food didn't take too long to come out but it's not clear when they call out your number so you need to check back frequently. I asked for the red salsa on the side and was good to go. Few things: 1. THE CARNE ASADA IS REALLY GOOD. Get it on your tacos. 2. The pork was a bit dry but still tasty. 3. The tostada was a little piece of heaven, I really enjoyed the beans, sour cream, avocado, and all. 4. The red salsa is REALLY SPICY. I laughed it off because I'm a spice freak but it has a super sharp peppery taste that builds slowly and then destroys your taste buds. So delicious, but make sure you're not stupid like me and finish your drink before taking one bite of the salsa. USE WITH CAUTION. Few gripes: 1. The tacos are smaller than I'm used to. I've been to other authentic Mexican food places and I swear they're not the size of half dollars. 2. Same thing with the tostada. Small. Total came out to $11 and some change. I consider it ehh considering the small portions but it's just TOO DAMN TASTY not to come back. Whatever you think you can eat, order two more tacos to that total. I'm also in love with the red sauce, but then again, I'm a glutton for punishment.

This place is one of the cheapest and reliable options for Mexican food in the Los Angeles area. The fact that they never seem to be closed makes them even cooler. I stick to their outstanding carne asada tacos, ordering usually 2 to 3 depending on how hungry I am, with a chicken mole tamale. These tacos are some of the best I've tasted in the continental U.S.  Shreds of beef are topped on some warm corn tortillas with onions and cilantro. Get their red hot salsa and their green salsa verde to eat with your tacos and you'll wonder how you ever lived your life without them. The chicken mole tamale comes out just right out of the oven. The spices from the dark mole sauce are full of flavor like cumin and cocoa powder and cooked with chicken. It sounds strange, but the flavors work beautifully together. People complain all the time about the wait for their food. I only tolerate it because the food is so damn delicious. Actually, the wait really sucks. HAHA. If you don't mind waiting an average of 20 - 30 minutes for your food, then come by El Taurino to fix your Mexican cravings and your drunken stupor.

Eh. I'm not a fan. I know it's almost identical to King Taco, but I like King Taco's layout better and the fact that King Taco has chicken tacos. Also, it might just be me, but are the portions here smaller? Because I ordered three carne asada tacos, a pollo sope, and a medium horchata ($9 total) and was even hungrier afterwards than I was before. That said, the sope was delicious (even though I finished it in two bites) and the carne asada tacos were well-seasoned. Just be careful with the red sauce -- I usually just use green sauce to preserve my taste buds.

Taurino would have gotten 4-stars EXCEPT I've been three times, and each time it takes FOREVER to order, and then FOREVER to get my food.  Seriously, my order takes under 2 minutes... so I have no idea what everyone in front of me in line is doing.. having a casual chat? You can sometimes avoid this wait by ordering from their taco truck if it's parked in the lot. On my first trip there was a super creepy clown.. not so appetizing. ALSO the quacamole is like.. the spiciest ever.  I usually think of guac as something with flavor but that can help to soothe the spiciness of say, hot sauce in your burrito.  It's also $1.25. The chicken is boring.. definitely order the carne asada.  Honestly, the carne asada tacos are the best deal for what you get: flavor for $1.25 each. (Side of guac or a taco for the same price? what?)

We ask our Hong Kong USC Architecture studio mate: "Hey, do you like mexican food?!" "Ah... no..." "but have you tried Mexican food before?" "Ah yes, I tried it before." "Where at?" "Ah, EVK." At that point, my friend immediately turned his car around. We walked in and enjoyed the authentic mexican atmosphere/decor and ordered. Our Hong Kong friend didn't know any spanish and became too scared to order himself..... So we ordered for him; fortunately, the workers can speak enough fluent english... He kept following my friends, but following someone's amount of hot sauce is NOT a good idea. My friend dunked half of the cup of red hot sauce into his burrito, and after my Hong Kong friend dunked the remaining half and began eating the burrito, he officially became scarred from Mexican food. "Hey, so how is it?" (shaking) "Ah... I'm only eating this because ahm's so hungry. I would eat all of this in one minute if it not so spicy... I sweating." Hilarious, but sad. the hot sauce really is hot, so beware. I ordered one chicken taco and a tamale. Surprisingly and fortunately, both were delicious and satisfied my hungry appetite. The chicken taco was above average, but not spectacular. I recalled hating tamales the first and last time i tried it (at 8 years old), so I decided to go for it one more time at a LEGIT mexican place. Well damn, that was one tasty tamale. I asked them to go light in the sweet cheese, and I couldn't even notice it- it still, was amazing, soft, and smooth. I didn't order a burrito because they seem overpriced; I wouldn't pay $5 for a small burrito with 80% meat. I left happy, only paying $~2.50 for my meal, while the other guys had to order 2 or 3 extra tacos after their burritos. The total for the other guys was at least $10 (Burrito, horchata, 2 or 3 tacos). Honestly, I don't think it's worth it - I'd rather pay for a $10 meal at a mexican restaurant like Adobe in Santa Ana....

Ah... El Taurino. My first meal here was in high school when my boyfriend at the time bought me a yummy carne asada burrito... at the time, it was the best I had ever had. Fast forward to 2007 and now their burritos are tiny with very minimal meat. Whether you order their carnitas, carne asada or chicken burrito, I find that their burritos consist almost 80% of salsa. Their green salsa is not as mild as you'd like to believe and their go a bit overboard on their use of onions. Fountain drinks tend to be flat almost 90% of the time. The truck parked in the lot can be convenient at times but you are limited to ordering burritos and tacos. The meat isn't the best quality and the carne asada tends to taste rubbery. 10 years ago I would have highly recommended this joint but now, they get a big fat hell no. (Also, for those of you want to try a similar joint but want to avoid the crazy wait and rude tacomakers, you might want to try King Taco instead. Owned by the same person as El Taurino and same quality, but slightly better service and definitely less of a wait.)

This is the on of the only mexican restaurant I've really enjoyed after coming back from the delicious mexican food in El Paso, TX. Why? Mainly because of their HOT SAUCE. The mouth burning, sweat producing red hot sauce is why I keep going back to El Taurino. Their carne asada tostadas, although a bit overpriced, are mouth wateringly delicious. A round fried tortilla, with refried beans spread on it, topped with the meat of your choice, pickled/caramelized onions, tomatoes, avocado slices, crumbled cheese, and a generous creamy dollop of sour cream. mmmmm i want one right now.

Kick ass all carne burritos with the salsa verde is the one for me. The cheese they slice of a slab and throw it in a pan to melt. Once it is at a proper consistency they slap it on your huge warm flour tortilla with the meat of your choice. The tacos are good too and my girlfriend says the tortas are off the chain.

Almost identical to King Taco except they offer tortas! Love the torta~ It's the best bang for your buck (sour cream, cheese, avocado, tomato, beans, meat on a bun) and just thinking about it makes me salivate.   As I'm ordering I always let them know I want "salsa verde aparte" cuz I can't hang with the red sauce anymore. It gives me major heartburn :( Due to the long waits, I try to go during off-peak hours (avoid weekend lunch/dinner/and 2am) cause the lines get ridiculous. Tip: There are 2 cashiers...the second one is located near the bathroom.

I'm with Peter P. - I was pretty disappointed with this place. It's seems to have a rep like Pinks but without the talent and the taste. I got the al pastor which was ok, until I tried a good one a couple of days later. Folks say the carne asada is good, but I'm not a beef guy. May be menu pictures would help a novice like me order, but my friends got a bunch of stuff too and none of it was outstanding. There wasn;t even any Mexican beer, just Bud Crap?! The hokey dining area and counter ordering makes this is one of my least fave Mexican places. Yet the customers keep coming and so many Asians :) They must know something I don't! :) We had to pay extra for cilantro etc. which is fine, except it was missed off the original order and we thought we'd already paid?! Service isn't the strong point of this spot.

Something we really lack in Portland and is non-existent in Hawaii is really good Mexican food. I used to eat here at least a few times a week but now that I'm living in Oregon, I'm a 2.5 hour flight away. Not only are they open 24HR but they have an armed security guard on watch always. That's especially good (insert sarcasm here ____) when you're there drunk at 3am waiting in line with the other 20 drunkards trying to get some good grub. My favorite item on the menu has got to be their steak tostada. I will usually order 2 or 3 depending on my hunger and an al pastor taco or two. The tostada is loaded up to the gills with a huge amount of beef, onions, avacodo, and sour cream. It would serve most females as a meal on its own, but I on the other hand, need like 3 of these because I'm such a pig! It has been quite some time since I've last been in LA but what I do know is the price has gone up exponentially. I remember I used to order 3 steak tostadas and a drink and it would hover around the $12 mark. Now just 2 tostadas alone was just under $10! Really? Yes, they are absolutely wonderful but what if I was really hungry and wanted 3 tostadas with a soda? I'd be $16+ in!! Not cool.

What's with Asians and mexican food?  Every time I come here, I have to fight through crowds of Mexicans and Koreans to get some tacos.   What do I see when I attempt to Yelp about El Taurino - crowds of asian people. El Taurino is nothing like the no-nonsense taco shops (taqueria, whatever) that you see in San Diego with the utilitarian white walls. This place has a cheddar cheesy orange interior, steer skulls on the walls, and Nortena music.  Awesome!   All this makes them tacos TASTE more authentic.   The tacos are good.  The burritos and tortas - eh.  But the biggest attraction here is the 6 dollar pitchers of beer.  6 bucks!  Freaking A!  Screw happy hour I'm going to Taurinos.  I guess they have to do something to make up for not giving WATER to people. So recap. Good: Tacos, Cheap Music, Feels like Meh - hee - co.  Open late too! Bad: Crowds, DMV-like lines, no water.

I went there after a night of Kclubbing and had the carne asada tacos and a sope...don't remember much but do remember having 3-4 tacos and sitting across from some serious gangbangers that were getting a kick out of my drunken taunts...("you ever heard of yuca frita or tostones mexicali?

The 20 minute taco!!! Came here Friday night for a late nite dinner, and must say it was good, not great. The thing that was a bummer was the wait!!! When we arrived, the place was not overly busy, but yet it took forever in line to place our orders. Then, after that long wait, it still took 15-20 minutes after that to get our food! So from ordering to delivery, expect to wait 25+ minutes. Food quality: Al Pastor: Quite good. Lots of flavor. Reminds me of true, authentic Al Pastor! Barbacoa: Skip. Carnitas: Decent: Pass. Carne Asada: Really worth trying! The good thing is they serve beer! Again, Downfall is standing in line forever to order, then having to wait even longer for the food sucks. Worth a try: Of course...

Over-rated. K-town peeps love this place, why?? It is meat, tortilla, salsa. The meat is way salty, dry, and the tortillas aren't anything special. I think it's a great place to hang-out late night, but the food quality is bad. I had the carne asada and the carnitas. It wasn't special. I'd rather make it at home and take it out to the clubs and eat it there. Avoid this place if you know your mexican food. All I gotta say.

4 stars, almost 800 reviews........ I don't need to add on another review for this place. BUT I MUST!   El Taurino is a LEGEND at UCLA (well at least amongst Koreans).  My roommates and I grubbed here almost once a week.  The whole world and your momma will be here after clubbing at 2AM, craving legit authentic delicious mexican food you can get NO WHERE ELSE after a night of drinking.  Nothing satisfies me anymore except El Taurino, not even SD mexican food!   Helpful Hints: 1. Long lines when it's busy, takes a long time for your food to come out, not necessarily the cheapest for what it is.  But it's all gravy.  It's going to be worth the drive, wait, and money.  (: 2. Famous for their hot sauce.  Green sauce = hot.  Red sauce = death. 3. If you don't order a Tostada........... I'm sorry... you're missing out. 4. My favorite order is: (1) al pastor tostada w no cheese/sour cream and (2) al pastor sopes w no cheese.  Hits the spottttt. If you haven't gone, you must go. If you've gone, show the love and rate this place!

But the best things here are the carne asada burritos.  I get mine w/ out rice and beans.  Sometimes just w/ the meat and rice.  But always w/ their delicious hot sauce.  Then, you have to get the sauce on the side but they started charging extra for each additional hot sauce!  what's up w/ that?  And, i have to admit that as the years have gone by, the size of the burritos have decreased.  Or maybe I've just increased...... but go for the Tortas and carne asada.  If you don't like spicy, ask for the sauce on the side.  If you like spicy, get it inside your burrito and on the side.  If you get the extra sauce w/out getting charged for it, let me know how you did that.  I need some pointers! the atmosphere is a hole in the wall and there are some funky things on the menu but I've never eaten anything other than the burritos and tortas and I'm perfectly happy.   oh, I am almost positive that this place is cash only so if you spent all your money at the club, hit up a atm first. and btw, king taco ain't as good as el taurino.

The same day we got back from a cruise from Ensenada, my gf was craving tacos again. Already in our path, we decided to see what the hype was about and gave El Taurino a try. Once again, another place over-hyped and us leaving unsatisfied. For a place that mainly sells tacos and burritos, I find it mystifying to the point where only Stephen Hawkings can answer why it takes 20 minutes to get a couple tacos. That's with 2 registers working at all times and 2 other windows that call the food. The PA system is so outdated that I can hear something more clear from 2 tin cans attached to shoelaces. I had to go up 3 times just to check if my order was ready. Not only that, while we were waiting in line the cashier opened up on the other side and she told the Mexicans behind us to go to her when it was obvious we were next in line. Their stinginess exudes from every corner with every little thing costing extra and they only gave us 2 hot sauce for buying $25 dollars worth of food. There's so many other little shops like El Taco Llama that are very generous with their hot sauces and carrots and pico de gallo but this place is so frugal that the mere straining from their pennies being pinched can actually be harnessed to power an underwater nuclear submarine for an indefinite amount of time. To the people that think El Taurino is good Mexican food obviously  haven't tried El Taco Llama. Thank allah I didn't have to drive out of my way to come to this dual akimbo shithole that works slower than an unlubricated latex exam glove going up my rectum on an arid day.

I recently watched Bon Apetit's Best Restaurants in America on the Food Network.  They broke it down into several categories and tacos was one of the categories.  I was HIGHLY disappointed that they didn't feature El Taurino as one of the best taco joints.   CMON!  This place rocks!  It's authentic and mothereffing delicious.  I can never get sick of eating here.  The carne asada tacos are the REAL kind with small warm corn tortillas with the moist beef, cilantro and onion...and if you're as badass as I am, you'll have them put the "salsa rojo" on the taco and then ask for a side of it too.  :) The mixed burrito and the all meat burrito is delicioso too. But there are downsides to this place...such as the wait...but if you know how to speak Spanish or if you're a REAL regular, they'll give you special attention, so put it to use if you can...and I'll just live vicariously through you. Another downside is how they started charging for the condiments, ie. the hot sauce, jalapeno.  very disappointing that they would start charging for condiments to such loyal customers :( It's just as bad as when McDonald's started charging for the bbq and sweet&sour sauce.  shame on them.

Late night gluttony!!! Cheap, tasty and kinda ghetto. Those 3 things combined make El Taurino the popular place that it is. After all, high-end schmancy Mexican food shouldn't be trusted...I don't care what anyone says. We ordered a bunch of sopas, some nachos, and a burrito. The burrito was mehhh...it fell apart while we were trying to eat it and it was a bit too dry....just full of rice and other boring things. So yeah, don't waste your time on the burritos. The tacos and sopas is where it's at! And while I gave it 4 stars, I wouldn't choose this place over Danny's Tacos downtown.

Ah El Taurino. What more can I say. If you truly know the best spots in Los Angeles El Taurino must be in your list. If it's not, then make it part of your list. Right now. I mean it. Stop reading my review and go get it. It's probably still open even if you're reading this late. Their burritos, sopas, tacos, tortas, tostadas, ALL DERICIOUSLY DERICIOUS. I was drooling while typing that. Their Rojo sauce. Oh jesus. OH JESUS. Try getting their rojo sauce and salsa verde and using both sauces on one bite of a fully loaded combo burrito or their carne asada and lengua tacos. If you regret it, you are not human. El Taurino has been a family tradition for me nearly every Sunday up until a couple years ago, so I don't eat it nearly 40 times a year as I used to, but I wish I still did. Only downsides to El Taurino now is their prices have steadily been rising for the past few years, but you can't really blame them. Lines can also be long because it is so DAMN DERICIOUS. GO NOW!!!!

El Taurino is my best best friend. Others have said it. The wait sucks, and the venue always overcrowded. The workers are stingy with hot sauces and shady with Koreans in general. (so stick with the male workers all you ladies). But it's okay. I can forgive. It still serves the best burrito created on earth. And the best hot sauce. Serve me one Carne Asada burrito with everything plus one extra hot sauce and onion + Horchata. and I'm good to go!

Huh? Am I at King Taco or El Taurino? http://www.kingtaco.com lists this address as being a King Taco but the sign says El Taurino. Very confusing no? So let's see, the carne asada tacos and salsa are exactly the same. The craptastical chips were the same but the al pastor, chicken and bean and cheese burrito NOT the same. All in all the carne asada and salsas made the trip okay but I almost cried when I realized the next day that a "real" KT was only .4 miles on Pico and Alvarado... IMO you should go the extra .4 mile to the "real" KT. But if you weren't expecting KT then this place is very very good :) Okay and now I am really confused because the address on KT's site is 1104 S. Hoover St.  Los Angeles, Ca 90006  and this address is different so I thought I was going crazy but the phone numbers are the same on KT and El Taurino's site. I'm thinking it was just the doors being on different streets?

So I went again at night to see if my prior experience was just a fluke and I was pretty disappointed.  Even more disappointed I dragged my drunk friend and his cousin (who remained in the car yacking his brains out) here swearing to him it was the best Carne Asada burrito joint ever.   The Carne Asada was a bit tough and dry.  I got a tamale and it was the same tamale you get from King Taco, pretty bland. El Taurino is no longer my go-to spot.  Maybe if it was around the corner from my house and the wait wasn't freaking like 3million hours at 2AM.. i MAY go here, but now, I'm sad to say.. El Taurino is a boo boo. Now when I leave Hollyhood - I'm either taking the 10 to SGV or going to Jtown for some late night grubbage.

Last weekend, stuck at a cabin at Bear Mt, a bunch of us were talking about what we are craving (stuff you can't get at Big Bear) and this taco place was mentioned. We made jokes about driving 2 hrs to pick up some food, and people who had been there were raving about the place. The weekend passed, and Monday came, and you know what, I told myself, I gotta go get some MEXICAN FOOD-- My menu of choice would be Burrito with Carne Asada and the spicy red sauce. My eyes were tearing by the time I ate a corner of a burrito and a small taco. There is something strange about the sauce- even though I was literally about to cry, I kept adding more of it on my food... That's addiction. I would have given this place 5 stars if the restroom wasn't so filthy and service was so slow. Overall I liked it !

This place and king taco have the best tacos in LA. But mainly, I feel like it's because of their SAUCE. My mouth is watering just thinking about that spicy, fiery sauce.... it's so spicy and so good.... I usually sweat eating that. But yea, anything touched by that make its 23423 x more delicious.... I usually get the carne asada tacos and have tried their chicken burrito and cheese quesadillas as well. Usually a typical place to go to after a night of drinking... hehe ;) BUT, this place is located in a super shady area...sooo BE CAREFUL!

Avoid this place ESPECIALLY AFTER 2AM if you've got any respect for yourself. Bunch of drunk dorkettes who confuse hot sauce with kimchi juice and general dorks looking for kimchi juice.

El Taurino is where all the asians go after the club so if you come here after 2 then expect to be here for about 2 hours. They also have a truck outside that only takes cash. I love the carne asada and al pastor tacos and of course the sopes. The carne asada is on point and the red sauce is fiyaaaaaah. It's so funny when my friends see guys that they danced with in the clubs under fluorescent lighting. Haha awkwaaaard!

Ole!! Ole!! Ole!! Here is one stink butt hole in the wall taco joint that is worth a try if you are in the area. Just do not order the nachos. They use canned cheese sauce with carne asada. Not that its a bad blend or tastes bad. Its just that in my opinion, carne asada deserves real shredded cheese. Im sure the poor cow that died would have been humiliated if he knew that we were going to eat his butt with canned cheesey sauce. On the flip side, the tacos are the shiznit and the hot sauce will make a grown man shed a tear while smiling ever so softly. The quesadillas are pretty good as well. The setup is unique in that each cook has his/her own workstation. As they receive and prepare your order they call you up to their station. Just be prepared for you numero en espanol. I prepare by figuring out my number in Spanish and the repeating it in my head until they call me. Believe me, I have gone to the wrong window on occasion and it aint the best feeling my friend. Sooo, if your in South Central and want a damn good taco, come by El Taurino. It's good for late night hoo-ha as well.

My friend was craving Mexican food and specifically wanted to go to El Taurino when we were up in LA.  You know if a restaurant is good if majority of the people eating inside are of the same ethnicity as the food.   I tried the cheese quesadilla and thought it was really good.  I'm a cheese lover so anything that's more than 50% cheese is good by my mouth.  I had bites of what my friend ordered, and boy it was a lot, and it was all pretty good.  I was a tad disappointed in the nachos but still decent.

There's always a line of people at this place, even after the restaurant portion closes and the only cooks still serving are in the mobile truck in the parking lot.  That's how good the tacos and burritos here are. I've tried a variety of the food but gravitate towards the all carne asada burrito or tacos.  As usual, it's just a tortilla with onions, cilantro, beef and that SAUCE.  I've tried to recreate this in my kitchen in NorCal and it just cannot be done. The bull fighting paraphernalia on the walls and the taxidermied bull head are creepy so I'd suggest you not actually eat there.  It's a taqueria, not a restaurant.  It's surprising to see all walks of life from grannies to 3 year olds sitting next to clubbers and couples. Whether it's 2:00 a.m. or 12:00 p.m., the food is delicious.  I always swing by here to pick some tacos up.  Ever heard of people ordering Zachary's legendary pizza to go for the plane?  Well, with me and El Taurino tacos...I've been known to take requests from friends.

4 Stars Got wasted after classes and ended up here at around 8 the other night. I remember last time they didn't live up to the hype, so this was their second shot at it: Taco (carne asada) - $1.25 - pretty good, but tiny, and more onions than I'd like to eat with any dish Sope (carne asada) - $2.59 - never had sope before, but a bunch of people told me to try it here and it was really good Torta (carne asada) - $4.75 - first time eating a torta, and I picked the right place to try it! This was off the hook!!! I could eat at least 3 of 'em on a full stomach just because it's so good! Nachos (carne asada) - forgot how much this was) - T\this time it was just w/ cheese and meat and it was good, but nothing too special Bottle Water - $1.25 - no cups of water, but I needed this to sober up anyway Side of Sour Cream - $1.25 - hahahah REALLY??? I forgot how much they overcharged for the Sour Cream here! This time, they were not as slow, but it wasn't late night.....and this time they DID live up to the hype. The tacos, sope, and sour cream are definitely overpriced, but I'll probably spend a lot more drunk nights here.

My favorite Mexican food place in all of LA.  The combo burrito is delicious and the tacos are great. The keys to remember are:  1) Ask for the salsa "aparte"(on the side) and get "crema y queso"(sour cream and cheese) in your burrito.  I love going here, not only for the food, but also to practice my AP Spanish skills.  The workers usually just laugh at the silly asian trying to speak their language, but they don't realize I scored a 3 on the AP exam in high school, orale! One thing I still have to try is their meat plates, which seem to be available only early in the day on the weekends.  All the locals seem to get this, so it must be good.  Next time I'll try it. If you want a true experience, get the red sauce inside your food, I double-dog dare ya!  Don't forget I warned ya, when you are cursing in the bathroom the next day.

I've said it before and I'll say it again.  El Taurino is overrated.  For my latest visit, I got an all-meat carne asada burrito for $5.99 + tax.  While the meat is pretty tasty, the burrito is tiny when compared to other Mexican restaurants or even taco trucks for the matter.  It's about half the size of a Chipotle burrito and runs for about the same price.   I could probably eat two of them but no way am I paying over $10 for Mexican food.  Totally not worth it. I still think their salsa roja is way too spicy.  I love spicy food but this really burns just for the sake of burning.  I needed a large drink to wash it down.  I know from experience that their horchata is not very good, so I tried piña (pineapple) this time.  A bit on the sweet side, but I liked it. El Taurino, you disappoint me yet again.  If only there were an Alberto's/Alerto's around...

My absolute favorite Mexican joint in L.A. It's pretty ghetto, but its the ghetto looking places that always have the best food. There is always a long line, whether you're here at 5pm or 2am, but they move quick! If you're a local, you know this is the where everyone goes to snack late night after partying. After you order, the wait can get annoying. But it's the wait that makes your food taste even more delicious. Make sure you know your basic numbers in Spanish so you can get to your food when they call your number with quickness! Order in excess; you will finish your plate clean. I always get a tostada (freaking bomb), 3 tacos and a horchata. That fills me up perfectly. And I'm a small girl, if I can do it, so can you. I mainly come here for the tostadas. Can't get em like this anywhere else, really. Make sure you get the red sauce and sprinkle it over everything. It'll make your mouth burn and sweat, but that's the fun part.

These guys originated the DF (Distrito Federal aka Mexico City) taco stand! IF it wasn't for them L.A prolly wouldn't be the taco powerhouse we are today we'd have tacos like San Antonio (ughhhh! chills) Americanized tacos. tex Mex tacos. ONLY. Well here's my secret: 97% of the time I get their Torta de bistec. That's a thin sliced steak sandwich mexico style, with avocado and ask for queso (cheese).Ask for Jalapenos. Buy yourself some Bohemia at the Food for Less across the street. Enjoy. For some reason that torta just pairs really well with a dark beer. Totally recomend their marinated pork and consomme when they have it. If you really want to live order one of their meat plate.s Any of them, especially if it's lamb/goat based. I know sounds weird. Trust me. Do it. I've been to 4 of their locales, I'm sad that this one doesn't have the fancy juice/fruit bar that the one in the valley does :( Pros: Meat lover's paradise, card for beer, taco truck right outside sells paired down menu in busy times. Lively bustling loud atmosphere. I hear they cater if you ask real nice. Cons: can get super busy and crowded. Cards for beer (if you are of age and forget your id no pleading, begging, amount of grey hair shown to clerk will get you a beer even if your buddies have ID. You my friend are assed out).

I've been here several times....I was just here 3 hours ago, which is why I'm remembering to write a review. I ordered 5 carne asada tacos. LEGIT. The red sauce is to die for. It's so spicy I love it. They definitely don't lie about it being spicy. It BURNSSSSS, but in a good way! 5 wasn't that filling....I could've ordered a 6th one, but the spicyness was killing me. I wish the tacos were bigger. I've had the nachos a while ago....in the picture it looked so good. DECEIVING! There was not enough cheese for the chips. My friends really liked the tostada, but I don't know...something about it, I didn't like. The sour cream didn't work for me. It was messy to eat. Yay for a parking lot in the back. Maybe because I went past 8pm, the lines weren't that long. They call the numbers out in both spanish and english....but its not very clear, so you REALLY have to be paying attention.

Their tostadas are exceptional. Lots of cheese.. and heavy so get two hands on those suckers. Fresh slices of avocados with many drinks to choose from so it ain't all sodas and horchata. I also got a rare shot on my phone - a black cocktail dress - a woman wearing a pancho -  and a guy with flannel. So the flannel guy is easy to find but couple that with the first two..

Carne Asada is better than par. I would give it 4 stars for the carne asada because its flavorful and pinch of lime flavor. yummy. Tostada- pretty good. its full of flavor and yummy. Nacho- PLEASE PLEASE DONT EVER GET THIS PLEASE PLEASE. If u are getting carne asada nachos for the first time, please dont get it here. their nacho is a 1 star to me. I LOVE nacho and usually i get it at all the mexican joint but not here. its small and the meat portion is small and like the cheese aint that great. nacho cheese gets cold fast and its Wack PERIOD. This is a three star joint because cmon, u see the line with 20 people, filled with asian and mexican, so u are expecting big things. I waited for atleast 20 minutes to order and 10 minutes to get the food. and if u dont know spanish, u better get ur spanish numbers on. Nothing but pure Uno Dos, Tres, and so on. and the workers dont like it if u keep on asking them if they called ur number. and Dont stand there and stare because u will get a look back. so if u order, just wait for like 10 minutes and wait for people before u to get the food, then go up to them. best way.

Not too spicy and juicy which is exactly how I like it. Then I poured some red sauce on top of one of the carne asada tacos.... My mouth still hurts, actually.... my teeth still hurt because my gums are still burning. There should be a warning label on that sauce. Aside from putting "hell" in my mouth, it tasted great so, no complaints. Love this place, totally coming back

I have to say... after going to el taurino so many times after my previous review, i've had a change of heart. El Taurino's tostada is simply the best out there. I believe it is much better than the King Taco tostada only because the one at El Taurino definitely has more flavor and more ingredients added to it. Not only is El Taurino delicious, it is also very cheap, and open very late to satisfy those late night munchies or cravings after a night out with friends.

El Taurino is easily one of the best Mexican joints in town. And LA does Mexican pretty damn well, so that's saying a lot. Get the al pastor. I know most people go for carne asada, because that's what they know. But trust me on this. Get the al pastor, it kills! So flavorful on its own, you don't even need salsa. If you must, the carne asada is a solid choice too. Always tender and juicy, with hints of lime. But you'll probably want some salsa on it. I usually love me some carnitas, but theirs is inconsistent. You never know if you'll get dried or juicy, and it definitely needs some salsa, preferably verde. Best of all? IT'S SO CHEAP! $1.25 Tacos!!! LOVE IT. (Tho, you can find cheaper.) Ask for salsa on the side when you order, sometimes they get stingy with it. And get both. The roja really isn't that spicy, but the verde has a kick you don't expect. MMM. Be prepared to wait, because they are SLOOoooOOW! You might get lucky if you go at some odd time, but they're generally always busy, and have maybe the most chaotic system around. They also have a tendency to screw up your order, I almost walked out with two sopes instead of four tacos today. And don't go there sober between 1-3am on weekends. (I know, why was I sober? Shush, I had to work late.) The place turns into a drunk (Korean) stomping ground. I swear I counted at least 5 guys stumbling around with VOMIT stains on their clothes. Unless of course you're drunk too, then by all means join your people. PS: There's a lot of Mexicans here too. I figured that'd be assumed.

I don't care that it's the cool thing to do.   It's open all the time. They have horchata. They have kickass tacos (including lengua, which rocks). Their salsa disintegrated my mild Japanese tongue. You can see Latinos and Asians co-exist harmoniously, even when completely drunk, like it's some kind of island paradise where tacos are the currency of love.

Man! this place is sooooo good! this place is open late so its definitely one of those places where u can come late at nite if you have some mexican food cravings. their tacos are so good! my personally favorite is the el pastor and la cabeza tacos but the carne asadas one are pretty darn good as well. be warned though, the red sauce is pretty spicy so if u cant handle spicy things, definitely ask for the green sauce. what this place is also really well known for is their tostadas. man the meat on top of the crispy tortillas. bomb! so if ure in LA and u finished up with a lakers, clippers, sparks, or kings game or just some concert at the nokia theatre, swing by this place. its only like 10 minutes away from the staples center so yea. definitely a place to grab a bite at a really good price compared to all that expensive food at the concession stands at those sporting events. haha.

The food here is decent.  I ordered a carne asada tostada and another chicken tostada.  I ate my friend's beef soft taco too since she wasn't able to finish... it was probably more tasty than my two tostadas since it was slapped with too much sour cream and barely enough meat because they were so busy.   The wait was horrendous! I've waited at least 55 minutes for my food!!! and they only took about 20 seconds putting together my tostadas.  This place definitely needs to improve in their efficiency.  It seemed like the employees were unorganized and they didn't know who ordered what until we had to show them our receipts before they prepared our food. All I could say is the service was horrible even though they had steam tables to serve.  There was windows #1, #2, #3.  Each window randomly called numbers for pick up, and we didn't know which window called who... so sad!!! I agree the food is good.  I finished my drink long before I picked up my food.  I recommend for you to not go there when they're busy. Three stars as I am being liberal about the experience.

Yum, yum, and YUM. Came here on the recommendation of a friend -- got a CARNITAS TACO and a CARNE ASADA TACO, a JALAPENO & CHEESE TAMALE, and split some CARNE ASADA NACHOS with a friend. Man alive, the memory of those nachos will haunt me until the next time I get to have them! SO DELICIOUS!!! Just chips drenched in a generous serving of nacho cheese and topped with a solid amount of carne asada, but MAN... it's magic in my mouth. And the CARNITAS -- so tender! So flavorful! Same goes for the CARNE ASADA. I couldn't decide which I liked better. The TAMALE was super-delish, too. But I love tamales the best, so I'm kinda biased. The interior isn't fancy, but the atmosphere is fun. I randomly ran into my brother, which NEVER happens outside of our home, so that was kinda cool. The one thing I didn't like was that there was a clown, and I am SO totally coulrophobic. *shudder* It was a scary one, too, all pink and orange and purple. *double shudder* You should come just to try the salsa. The red makes me sweat profusely, so I call it my cardio workout for the day. WIN!

I can safely say this is the best Al Pastor taco that I have had in Los Angeles. I haven't tried them all, but El Taurino will be tough to beat simply based on the quality of their pork. 4 Al Pastor tacos and a Carne Asada sope or two and you'll be living the high life. Not to mention that you'll be burning up pretty bad too. This is the most fiery salsa roja I've tried, but it is fantastic. Nothing a tall horchata can't fix. If you don't think you can handle the heat, they will gladly subtitute the much milder salsa verde for the roja. Be aware that long lines can form around lunch and any hour on the weekends. It is not the fastest service, but it's about as cheap and flavorful as it gets.

Let me break it down for you people.. This dirty little joint is legit and is most likely the realest Mexican restaurant you'll ever step foot into (unless you're Mexican). Yeah King Taco is good too and its cleaner blah blah blah. Then you stay there! El Taurino is for the realest of the real. Because let's be honest here, we can only eat out of roache-coaches for so long. Recommendations: All things carne asada, the tostadas and sopes are to DIE for, and of course the infamous tacos. Tip: Get the green & red hot sauce. Mix a little together over your food, MMM BOMB. + They have flavors coming out of the wazoo + You'll always find parking + They don't speak English, you don't speak Spanish but yet they still get your order right. + The'yre open late! + CHEAP.

RATING IS BASED ONLY ON THE TOSTADAS!!!!! I do not recommend the carnitas as much, but the pollo and the asada are EXTREMELY delicious.   Let me try describing it.. A crispy tortilla shell topped with a choice of asada, pollo, or carnitas then some pickled onions, creamy sour cream and 2 slices of amazing avocado. At first I thought it was fairly expensive (~$4), but 2 of these get me pretty full. I really like it!!!

I care less if El Taurino and King Taco are from the same owners or share the same recipe.  It's as good as King Taco. I enjoyed Al Pastor taco over Carne Asada but what made this whole experience so annoying was that they called your numbers in Spanish. Now, my order number was 398.  I have no idea what 398 is in Spanish.  I literally went to the counter like 5-6 times to check if my number was called.  They looked at me funny, as if I was so stupid for not knowing 398 in Spanish and kept ignoring me.  Do you KNOW the number 398 in Korean?   HUH??  Cause I DO.  Who's stupid NOW!!! Cinco (number 5) is the highest number I can count up to in Spanish after I took 4 years of it in high school (it's been a while).   But to be honest, they can call my order in any language they want as long as I get my tacos.  It's so good.

Wow, this place has an absurd number of reviews.  I've only been here once and would probably go back and try it and maybe have a different experience here. The burritos are pretty good here.  I ordered a carne asada burrito when I was here.  While it was tasty, it lacked a sort of je ne sais quoi.  It was good, but not excellent or amazing.  It also left me with sort of a stomach ache. Ordering here is super confusing.  Though I know it's a Mexican restaurant, it would be nice to have people behind the cash register who understand some English, even if minimally.  Here, they only seemed to speak Spanish so communicating was rather difficult.   Another of my qualms with this place is that they really don't give you enough food.  My burrito was pretty small and was not filling.  I still had room after that to eat a second dinner.  The $1 tacos is a good deal though, though I didn't order that. Also, I don't really like the atmosphere in the restaurant - the decor isn't really great.  I prefer more authentic decor.  This place is just all over the place with all sorts of wild colors and decorations. All in all, the meal was good and I would come back here and give it another try.

This is one of those hidden gem type joints. I think what makes it so bomb is the hot sauce and the meat. What I normally order is a 'puro carne burrito' with avocado. The meat is marinaded in the most awesome spices and the hot sauce gives me the hugest boner known to man kind. Straight up. But be careful, its a tad on the hot side. It's so packed with flavor, it makes you wanna bathe in it. Or like they say in Beerfest, "I wanna stick my d*ck in it. I want it to stick its d*ck in me!" So on to the more helpful part of the review: El Taurino is a spot not too many people know about. It gets kind of crowded at times, especially late at night after drinking. The lines can get a little long, but most definitely worth the wait. Like other people have mentioned, it's a sister company of King Taco, so the prices are a little higher than your typical taco truck or other late night Mexican spots. In other words: Go and eat there, but make sure you have a sweater to tie around your huge erection, or just tuck it under your waistband. Ladies, this will be your first experience of an erection. Welcome to the club.

Riquisimo! Tacos are plain and simple: tender, delicious meat and tortillas as soft as a baby's bottom. If that doesn't entice you, they've also got some mean salsa. It's pretty spicy. I recommend the red one. It's a little smoky, but don't worry - the peppery kick won't get lost in the haze. The hit will be like an elementary school bully: it'll catch you by surprise, slap you in the face, and make you cry. But the two of you will make up and you'll keep eating delicious tacos. I had the cabeza taco. The meat was kinda spongy and flavored really well. If you don't want any chewy meat, I'd recommend that. As a side note, this place also has amazing temporary tattoos. Check out the dispensers that are across from the cashier. I'm vowing to make it a tradition to buy a tattoo every time I go there.

I'm going to start off by saying that this is one my favorite spots in Los Angeles after a long Friday/Saturday night.  El Tuarino gets packed around 1-2am because every single person from Koreatown craves some of these delicious tacos and burritos after a night out with their friends. I usually order 2 tacos and one combination burrito 'con salsa rojo' with everything in it. It usually comes with carne asada, onions, cilantro, beans and rice. Now, the size of these burritos have gotten a lot smaller the past few years, but it'll still fill you up to the point where you don't know if you can finish the two tacos. The tacos come with carne asada, onion, and cilantro with the choice of having the sauce on top or on the side. I would also recommend the tortas or tostadas! The tostada comes with carne asada, avocado, feta cheese, sour cream, tomato on a hard shell. The torta is like the tostada minus the feta cheese and the hard shell. Instead, it comes with two medium sized buns! Now, let me warn you about these crazy sauces. The red sauce, also known as 'salsa rojo' WILL MAKE YOU SWEAT. There's a crazy spicy kick in the sauce which is often addicting, but it also results in the numbing of one's tongue if consumed too much. On the other hand, I LOVE the green sauce, 'salsa verde'. It's spicy, but it has a distinct different taste compared to the red sauce. The green sauce tastes more like a jalopeno/cilantro sauce all together! The most difficult part of El Taurino would be the number calling from different windows because the native speakers speak so fast, it's hard to keep up with the number calling. But don't fret! The workers understand that a lot of their customers are not fluent in Spanish, so sometimes when you feel like your food should have been out a while ago, if you walk up to any of the windows and nicely hand out your receipt, the workers will guide you and tell you if your order has been called out or not. Not to mention, their burritos are about $4-5, the tacos $2-3. It's so cheap and it's affordable for anyone! You'll also see the cultural side of this restaurant, with the traditional Spanish music playing from the jukebox and various pictures and posters from rodeos! If you're lucky, you might even run into the clown there that makes/sells balloons to the kids that come with their parents. It's a fun place to be with family!

The original! I used to believe that King Taco was the greatest place ever, but then I realized they robbed the idea from here. This place is very yummy. The carne asada is delicious and not too greasy and grimy. The salsa verde is muy delicioso :) The neighborhood is a bit scary, and I would go with a friend that speaks Spanish.

El Taurino is bomb. This place used to not be that crowded or popular, but over the years, it's gotten really crowded. It's funny because it looks like a normal, small Mexican food joint, but since it's become so popular, they've upgraded in many areas to handle the huge lines. They have a gazillion cashiers, but still they're usually not enough to make the wait go faster, especially when you're sooo hungry. I love the sopes w/ Mexican cheese and tacos with the green sauce. However, they do try to skimp on the sauce. I think it's because a lot of people used to just take a whole bunch and then not use it. Anyways, it's a little pricey if you're super hungry, but it's so darn good.

Ok, I've been coming here since 1992, and though it has gone through many changes (no more bull and matador painting on the side of the wall, cleaner menus, and smaller portions), it is still my favorite place for tacos and burritos. Everyone talks about King Taco and what not, but then when I bring them here, everyone forgets about King Taco and gets really embarrassed that they thought that King Taco was any good in the first place. Oh, I think I'll explain how you order your food.   1. Stand in line, place your order, pay your money, and get the receipt (sounds pretty standard, right), 2. The cashier will tell you what window to go to (usually either #1 or #2), 3. Wait at the window, and when they call your number, give them your receipt, and they'll make your food and give it to you (it gets a bit loud, so pay attention and also they say the numbers in Spanish, and sometimes English). There you go, not that bad if you know what you're doing. Oh, and for beer, you can either go directly to Window #4 and order and pay for it.  Or order and pay for it at the cashier with the rest of your food and then go to Window #4 to pick it up (actually, this goes for all drinks, not just beer, but beers go so well with the burritos and tacos).

Searching for a nearby place w/ cheap food and good ratings, we found this place via Yelp. The parking lot was fairly large and equipped with its own security guards. At first glance, one would think it was just a taco stand (since it was right there in the parking lot), but when you walk past it towards the corner of what appears to be a liquor store, it's actually the (rest of the) restaurant.  The inside is quite spacious and decently clean as any fast-food joint could be. It was busy but one if the indoor security guards was nice enough to tell me that another cashier just opened. While waiting for my order, two stuffed bull heads mounted on the walls overhead caught my eye. As I stared at them, I pondered about whether or not mounting the bullheads right over the tables where customers would sit to dine was actually safe or not. Then my number was called, along with something else in Spanish. I went up to the pickup windows to see which one had my food, but there was nothing and no one at any if them. After waiting a few minutes, I was able to get the attention of a worker behind the counter to ask him. He told me to ask the lady who was standing right beside him.  I couldn't understand her, but she showed me hot sauce and I nodded. My carne asada combo burrito (meaning it had both beans and rice in addition to the meat choice) was a bland and dry disappointment. For the $6 I spent on it, I could've had a bigger and more flavorful burrito at Chipotle or some other burrito joint.  The hot sauce they gave me was actually somewhat spicy, so that did add some flavor and moisture to that so-called burrito. I tasted the carne asada quesadilla my friend had and it was quite good. I'm generally not a quesadilla person, but at least that was better than my burrito. So I'll give one star for that.  Another star for the awesome hot sauce--that is, it was actually mildly spicy even for me, which is rare. I wouldn't recommend getting a (carne asada) burrito from here. (Then again, it could've just been [that batch] for that night..).. To be safe and not have a disappointing burrito like I did, you should order whatever the other people recommended if you do come here.

SO F_CKN GOOD! This place is fairly sized but was extremely packed that you had to vulture seats. The wait sucked. Utensils were hard to come by, but thats because everyone was using it. These are the only negatives I can list, and this list seems childish. Onto the good: OMG the TOSTADA is ORGASMIC. I'm not joking, al pastor tostada was quite simply the greatest memory of good mexican food for me and like drake say, you gotta write a dedicate a song for this one.. best I ever had. The meat is flavorful and the avocado and cheese and hot sauce all mixed so well! Each bite was like a crunch Monica described "2-4-6. 2-4-6.. 7.. 7.. 777777!!" I also got the carne asada torta, which was also bomb. The carne asada meat was still good They accepted card (I'm surprised.. really) with no charge and the wait was more than worth it. Probably not worth driving all the way up there for mexican food, but if you're close enough, you GOTTA try it. King Taco ain't got shit on this place

Classic, very fine down town L.A. cuisine. I can always count on El Taurino... My carnivore fellows, gather together and trust that you can purchase a plateful under a few bucks.. Love their tacos. Adore their burritos. NEED their sopes. If I have $10 in my pocket, I'll treat myself for the rib-eye steak (a.k.a. greasy bones). They're kinda stingy with their salsa (actually, they're stingy with everything including service), but fortunately my non-Hispanic taste buds don't allow me to have too much salsa anyway, so it's fine with me.

This is the DOPE SPOT and when I say that I mean it. There used to be a time when there was a crack house down the street and the dealers would stake out their territory. Being the nice guy that I am I took a friend here to try some tacos. It just happened to be Let's Take Your Life Away Day as we heard gunshots ring out. Too bad he never got the chance to taste the food. There is always a line here. And now these damn Koreans have made this a food spot hangout. Why can't I just get my taco in peace and quiet? Well they come in all sorts of meats and cuts. At El Taurino they have brain, tongue, sheep head and all that far out stuff. I stick to the basics the pastor which is a bbq pork and the carne asada. They also have plates of barbacoa for about under 10 bucks. The taco sauce here is spicy but I can muster the green one in little increments dashed with a squeeze of lemon. People love the hot sauce here. They do have beer here and mexican drinks like horchata and jamaica whatever they call it. Prices are good and they always deliver the goods here.

I was brought to this place by my old high school friend, Doc Jas, that I knew from way back in the day. As a traditional Korean guy, he loved hot spicy foods just like me. (I'm Chinese/Japanese) He told me the tacos at El Taurino were pretty good but more so, the red (rojas) sauce was kickin'. Kickin' hot that is! (There is a green mild one too.) Given that I live in west LA and was driving to Pasadena for tacos (more on that later), anything that might cut my drive down by 12 miles got my interest. So we strolled into this place and right away it had this "down homey" feel to it. The decor of the place was bulls (El Taurino) and matadors. The place was mixed with Latino and Korean people. An unusual mix anywhere else in the country, but on the edge of K-town, not so strange. After about a 15 minute wait on line; we ordered 12 tacos, an orchata (a kind of milky drink - people say its good here), and a pitcher of Michelob. Approximate cost $24 bucks. Michelob is the premium beer on tap, the other is Bud. Doc Jas got the orchata to drink in addition to some of the beer. After another 20 minute wait, we heard a muffled number called out in Spanish/English on an intercom and we got our food. Man, those 7-years of Spanish lessons in high school sure come in handy. (Advice: Learn how to say the numbers in Spanish before you come here or you won't be sure if your number was called!) As promised the tacos were good and the sauce was hot. I mean, I often use Mezzetta's Habanero sauce and I still found it hot. Gotta say though, it was good. The carne asada is tasty, the al pastor good, but I think the place has a "lock down" on the carnitas (broiled pork). Crispy and tasty. In regards to their burritos, tortas, and other dishes, all my other friends swear that its better than King tacos.   After coming back to this place often and at all hours of the night, I have to say its not as dangerous as advertised. However, I have observed that the security guards are armed with guns and appear a bit nervous at times like they're ready to shoot at the first sign of trouble. Hmmm...what's that all about?! Then again, life always has its risks right? I consider this place "cheap and cheerful." Open 24 hours on Friday and Saturday nights and late all other days. Its a casual place with a blue collar feel. The kind you might find me in between 8pm - 12am on any given day, eating tacos with a pitcher of beer and reading a book.

I have one word: TORTA!!! Man!  Am I going crazy?  I hear about tacos, burritos, and quesadillas, but you're missing the prized possession here.  The greatest heavyweight hitter of the El Taurino menu is the TORTA, man!   The bread is buttered like no other, fluffy & slightly toasted to perfection.  The carmelized onions... MMMMM!!!!!!!!  The meat (you can honestly choose anyone: carne asada, lengua, etc.), the thick slice of melted cheese, & the avocado equals the Mexican Sublime.  Oh!  And I forgot to mention the Mexican Sour Cream... Wow!!!   And concerning El Taurino VS King Taco debate, I'd like to put my 2 cents.  They both have the same sauce... So they're both the Mexican Promised Land... Where the land flows with Horchata and Green Sauce.  But, King Taco, honestly man, has more flavor.  If you did the Pepsi challenge (which I have) with the carne asada meat at El Taurino and King Taco, you'll find the El Taurino drier.  It's because they lime the meat at King Taco.  For the Mexican staple food (i.e., Carne Asada, not Corn), no one does it better than King Taco.  But, El Taurino definitely has the variety.  The par excellence of El Taurino's Torta puts it on equal standing with King Taco.   Here's an idea for you K-towners who have El Taurino (Olympic & Hoover) and King Taco (Pico & Alvarado) within a mile of each other.  I did this before a USC graduation (remember Chris Esser).  We ordered Tortas at El Taurino, took them to King Taco, then ordered Carne Asada nachos at King Taco with Drinks (cause they're cheaper at King Taco).  That's where you can witness, for yourself, the Pepsi challenge between El Taurino & King Taco meat.  But, it makes for a great meal.

As everyone mentioned, the red hot sauce is awesome as it has a real fiery kick which I love.  I usually only get the carne asada burritos and tacos and sometimes the el pastor so can't review all types of meat or dishes.  Overall, it's affordable (cheaper than the trucks at least)...the portions are good although a little smaller than years ago and they are pretty efficient in getting your order out.  Parking is easy, there are guards inside so you can feel a little safe while eating. haha They take credit cards so that's a huge plus as I'm so over cash only places that you don't know it's cash only until you actually walk in and order...

This is the best taco place outside of the barrio (East Los!) I love the tacos, and all of the salsa is good (green and red). They are pretty authentic. I also ask for the radishes and some lime. The tostadas are pretty amazing. They are huge, and they use a special sour cream (is a bit sweet too). Burritos and tortas are also popular (I only recommend those if you are HUNGRY). Since they are open 24 hours, it is super convenient.

El Taurino used to be the shit. But, along with King Taco, the prices are going through the roof. Their red sauce is still the BEST, but better Mexican food can be had for cheaper elsewhere. ... Also, I feel like I'm a pretty friendly Asian dude, but I swear Asians get worse service here. ... Also, I went here with my mother several years ago, and a couple less-than-sober dudes started saying less-than-flattering things to her. I almost got in a huge fight and security had to get involved. You can get the exact same food at King Taco, so I'd rather go there and avoid the ridiculous lines of this place. Good food, shittastic restaurant.

This place is a spitting image of King Taco a few blocks away. Some have said they are related somehow and I would believe that. The food is on great but falls just short of King Taco. The meat is tasty but the marinade is a little off. One annoying thing is that they are so stingy with their sauce. You get one sauce per 5 tacos. I am a sauce lover and needs more than that. They charge $.69 for an ounce of additional sauce. There is plenty of seating here though and the parking is much easier than over at King Taco.

One of my favorite stops after watching a game at Staples! Chances are, you've heard that they are known for their tacos and it's thanks to their red sauce.  "So what's up with the sauce?"  Well it's spicy as hell.  "What do you mean?"  Cause I actually got hiccups from it.  I totally didn't expect their sauce to be so spicy so it definitely caught me off guard when I poured the whole thing over one taco.  Not smaaart at all.  Made me finish my soda and had to order another to cool me down. All the selections for meats are good but I like the al pastor and carne asada the best!  You can really taste the marinade from both.  Too many times carne asada just taste like beef but you can actually taste the lime, and all the different goodies it was marinated in.  As for the al pastor, drippings fall from the tacos when you take a bite, and that's a good sign :] If you like burrito, get the all meat. Nachos are pretty good, but only if you get onions with it.  Don't expect too much piled on top of it though, since it is mostly nacho cheese and the meat of your choice. Tamales sell out quick here because they get theirs from King Tacos, which I think is a good idea since King Taco has one of the best tamales. Pitchers of beers are actually reasonable and what goes better with beer than crazy hot sauce?  Come here with a few unsuspecting friends, get a pitcher, and watch your friends sweat bullets from the sauce for a good laugh!

Pretty good Mexican restaurant.  Things I tried and recommend: 1) Carne Asada soft taco: the meat was soft and definitely not chewy, if     you love your hot sauce then by all means tell them to put it on, if you     want more control of it, have them put it on the side because they will     load that puppy up with so much hot sauce it's unbelievable. 2) Tamale (chicken and beef): good but not worth it for the price.  They     don't put enough meat in their tamales. 3) Horchata: by far the best I've tasted...in the U.S. the BEST is in     COZUMEL, MEXICO in a little restaurant called CASA DENIS Service was fast, but then again we came during downtime.

Al pastor tacos...the best! It's $1.25/taco! Don't even bother with the sauce. Well you can, but you don't need to. They're that good. If you add the sauce, be prepared, it's SPICY. I can handle spicy and I started hiccuping...but it was so good that I couldn't stop myself. Also tried to carne asada taco and sope... the al pastor was the definite winner! It's no wonder there were so many people here... which is a great sign. The wait was long ... long enough to make me realize how many times I failed at Angry Birds (5-7 games). meh. Neato little fact - they bring out their taco truck at night! Woohoo! I guess because business is so good? We also went to another taco place right after this and realized how much better quality the meat is at El Taurino.

Oye! this place has got some of the spiciest red and green salsa I have ever had. It burns all the way down your esophogus (spelling?) into your stomach and lingers with a tingle. I really only go for their Tostadas!! My sister in law said they were pretty authentic, and they use crema (not sour cream), spread a thin layer of refried beans, avocados, cotija cheese, tomatoes, and marinated onions (and they taste so good to me!), and of course your choice of meat. If you are a vegetarian, it may be hard to explain that you just want beans.  When I used to eat beef and pork, I loved their carnitas... (as I salivate). The tortas are tasty as hell also, cuz they butter and lightly grill the bread so it has that nice flavor. Carne Asada is whatevers to me, and the latino folks seem to love that steak plate which does look pretty damn good. I have had better burritos in my opinion. And yes, if you don't speak Spanish or even Spanglish, you don't want to go alone for the first time. It is crazy hectic, and confusing. I still don't understand which counter you go to after you order your food but somehow I always hustle my way into a line. You have to order your food, get a receipt and somehow figure out which line to get into and have them make your food. Weird, but if you see someone getting something that looks like what you ordered, get in that line. Open 24/7, yeay baby!

Loooong line when we got there around 8PM, but it moved pretty quickly! Also meant there werent many seats left, but by the time the food was ready there had been enough turnover that something opened up without too much stalking. Everything is mildly spicy, as a warning to people that dont like any. I had pork tacos and they were great! Horchata was good too although pretty sweet, more so than I would normally like.

This spot gets my vote for best al pastor in LA.  You can really taste the hours of marinating and roasting in every bite. Also check the barbacoa (goat) which is their specialty and the carne asada. They've been around since the 70's and enduring long lines are a testament to Taurino's greatness. Inside is done up as a kind of shrine to bullfighting and they get extra points for the massive bull's heads mounted to the wall - if you think about it you've got to have pretty huge balls to put a actual bull's head inside of a taco stand. But that's how great this place is. Don't miss.

When i was introduced to these tacos, i had them twice in one night. At dinner in an italian joint, the subject of delicious tacos came up. So for "dessert" it was a trek to King Taco (same difference) and ordered a few carne asada tacos. Delcious.   Then the drinking happened - LO AND BEHOLD, we had a craving for more carne asada. TO THE EL TAURINO!!! On several instances, I have left my house which at the time was 50 miles away, at midnight, only to have these tacos y burritos The all meat carne asada burrito leaves you with a bomb of grease at the bottom, it's disturbing. What's more disturbing, is that it actually kind of tastes good - especially when drunk. Their carnitas are delicious as well. There are a few other items that interest me but i never get around to ordering them. I do really dislike the fact that El T charges a few coins for soda refill. And they make you wait in line OH and Bryan K's comment about the red salsa is correct. One time, I was with my buddy and i simply could not eat the food covered in the red sauce. Homeboy was sitting there dousing his food with it and called me a wuss. I gave him the remainder of my salsa rojo.... which was easily 25x hotter. Yeah, he was crying in pain. One day, i will try ranchera costilla. Maybe...

Words cannot explain how much i LOVE and CRAVE the Carne Asada at this place. The Carnitas are also to die for. The arroz- muy bueno! I have not tried the rib meat yet (the combo especial) but I heard that was soooo good as well. The only thing I hate is being around all the Paisas (LOL) but I am sooo over it Good parking, open LATE, cheap beer, what more can you ask for?? I know this is mexican blasphemy but I hate King Taco and King Taco does NOT taste like El Taurino. El Taurino has its own tastes. If you don't speak Spanish, be prepared to get your food hella later than everyone else because they will be announcing your number for like the next 10 minutes before they realize you probably don't speak Spanish. Ask the cashier what number you should be hearing so you don't miss your order!

Nothing tops El Taurino's late night hours with all kinds of people from different walks of life. Located in Korea Town, it's usually packed with every major ethnic group, and tons of after hours kids wanting more fun and laughs, wanting greasy tacos y burritos, ha, even tortas y sopes! There is nothing better than cheap greasy Mexican food in the middle of night, and El Taurino is one of these magical only in LA places, which I simply love, for the vibe and colors. And don't forget about the jukebox with mandatory Latin hits, which add an unforgettable flavor along with stoned kids munching on nachos;) loves it!

I tends to get busy at night times especially in the weekends after people come to eat after a night of clubbing/party or what not. King Taco's carne asada tastes the same too. you can go either one.

I went to El Taurino with my fiancee on a Saturday night after getting out of a club.  She had just eaten the food the day before and liked it so much that we had to go back. Unfortunately, she didn't tell me that it takes like half an hour to get your food.  This place is definitely not the place to go to get a quick fix.  I was so annoyed watching the people making the food take their time walking back and forth from the counter to the back in a zombie like fashion.  they were in no hurry to get your food to you.  So after waiting forever for our food, we got our order and drove home to eat it.   I had ordered nachos con carne and guess what I got... Nachos.  that's right, no con carne.  no meat!!!  WTF?   sure, the food that my fiancee got the day before was good, but I'd rather go somewhere else that's just as good and not have to wait 30mins or more to get my food.   They must be doing something right for some people, though, because I have to admit the place was packed.

I hate Mexican food.  Okay, I don't hate it but of all the foods that I have ever tried, Mexican has always been the style that stimulates the least amount of interest in me.   Not any more.   I have my first official Mexican destination restaurant - El Taurino.   Some new friends brought me here after a standard night out on the town.  Sure, we were a little un-sober and that may have added to the appeal but I wasn't that bad.  I do remember thinking secretly inside that I would much rather go to Yoshinoya or K-Town or anything, really.  Anything except Mexcian.  I hated it right up until someone handed me my burrito and I took that first bite.  Call it "love at first bite."   I had the Carne Asada burrito with everything.  I devoured my own and even ordered another one to go.  $4.85.  Heaven.   When I explained to some other friends the next day, I described it as the perfect combination of rice, beans and meat.  Everything was seasoned super spicy (not for the faint of heart).  I loved it.   I can't speak for anything else on their menu but I will definitely be back for another one of those bad boys (or 6).

A little bit overrated, in my opinion. Dont get me wrong, it's mighty mighty tasty, and the hot sauce is to die for (if it doesnt kill you), but the way people talk about it, you would think you could discover the meaning of life with every bite. When I first came here, the people I was with were like.. "OMGOMGOMG youve never been to El Taurino?!?!?!!?!??!?!!?" Why they think I would be lying about something as trivial as if I've ever been to a restaurant before is beyond me, but whatever. I digress. Anyways, they serve beer, which is awesome. And they are open late. Helpful hint, they dont have limes, so buy some across the street, cut those bad boys up and squeeze the goodness into your tacos. You'll thank me later..

I freakin' LOVE this place!! I can't get enough of their carne asada tostadas; there's just something about the meat. It gets quite busy regardless of what day of the week it is (in my opinion). LISTEN UP!!: CALL in your order. I guarantee it will cut your wait time!! I swear! You don't have to wait in line to pay either; just go straight to the cashier and tell them your name. The cashier will walk your order to the prep line and they will make it right then and there. I can't believe I didn't know about this before! It hasn't failed.

Carolina: One word: overrated. The tacos are ordinary enough that you can find them at the taco place a block away from your house.. If you must go, the carne asada tacos taste a lot better than al pastor, which I did not necessarily enjoy. For really good tacos, go to that stand outside of the LA Opera!

*I love carne asada tacos, and that's all I've ever come here for. I hate onions, so I order them plain. Good: The tacos are simply delicious. The meat is LEAN, so you won't have to chew on any fat whatsoever. It is thoroughly cooked, but not char grilled, it has a hints of citrus that goes excellently with the restaurants green sauce. The tortillas are fresh, and quite simply you can't get any better than El Taurino. There is ample parking and interior seating is ample, but because it is so popular, it can feel like it is too small. Bad: Wait times, prices are high relative to other taco places, and I despise the weekend crowd. The decor of the restaurant features bullfighting souvenirs, which may not be to everyone's liking, especially the large bull heads hanging over head. Conclusion: If you want a good carne asada that won't feel like a brick in your stomach, go to El Taurino. If however, you prefer large portions of flavorless and disgusting fatty meat swimming in oil, go to El Parian.

I was first introduced to  El Taurino about 5 years ago and automatically fell in love. The tostadas were one of a kind, consistently packed with toppings [beans, your choice of meat, sour cream, cheese, avocado] and an insane amount of flavor.  I absolutely loved the lengua here, since it was different from most places - very well marinated.  To top off most things here, their red hot sauce had the kick of Lionel Messi [okay, bad joke] but you get what I'm trying to say. That was THEN and this is NOW. I honestly don't know what happened.  Maybe they just got too popular and couldn't handle the demand - who knows.  The quality of the food has dramatically taken a hit. Portions are very small now, they give you very little meat and orders seem rushed.  There are also extremely long lines, especially during peak hours.   I hope and pray that El Taurino goes back to it's old ways but I think that might be wishful thinking.

Don't get me wrong, the food is tasty.  But charging me $2.00 for Salsa left a bitter taste in my mouth!  AND they charged me $5.00 for a really small Burrito Al Pastor!  For that price, you can get a huge tasty burrito at Rosarito's in Pasadena with all the free salsa you want!

El Taurino is one of those places where the food always tastes better late at night. My friends and i stop by to eat here pretty often , usually after school events and were starving and want some decent cheap food . I usually get the carne asada burrito or tacos. The HOT sauce here is sooooo good ! I always add extra in my burritos. It's pretty spicy after you stop eating , but thats why you can always get the cinnamon drink they have to cool it down. Clean wise , it's alright , sometimes i forget if they called my number or not because they usually say it in spanish . On thursdays it gets pretty full at night with drunken people who are here to eat after clubbing , but it's still a pretty nice to place to stop by to eat and feel satisfied after leaving.

I admit the al pastor tacos are good here. Tacos 3.75 stars Service 1 star.   Forget about coming here late night, your buzz will be gone by the time you get your tacos and you'll be starving. I knew there was going to be line there on a particular thurs night so I called ahead and gave them plenty of time.  When I got there I waited for 20 minutes and then when I inquired about my order they started making my pre order right there and then.  WTF!  We weren't the only ppl this happened to.  So I waited another 25 min. Don't bother calling ahead.  It will be just an exercise in frustation. You would think El Taurino would be more streamlined since they sell 10,000 tacos a day.

I just created a Yelp account and decided to choose El Taurino for my first entry because I absolutely LOVE this place.  I found out not too long ago that my mom used to bring us tacos from El Taurino ever since we were young.. so maybe that's why I love it so much.  But yeah, PLEASE try the all-meat carne asada burrito!!! It seems like it's too much.. but it's perfect.  Sometimes the food takes a long time to come out but it's always worth it.   Tip:  If you can't handle too spicy, get the sauce on the side because it's really, really spicy.. Sometimes they're cheap about their sauce so they only give you one.  In that case, I usually ask them to give me half red and half green and it's really good!

This place is really popular and the lines can be extremely long, however that does not deter me from waiting in the parking lot for their delicious carne asada tacos!! I would say their tacos are the only great thing, burritoes are "decent" and rather small for the 4.95 price tag.  Tacos i believe are $1.25 each which is quite pricey for me since i'm so used to deals at restaurant like Taco's Mexico that offer 2 for $1 specials or $.75/taco at regular price.  I have to say the carne asada meat is pretty tasty and unique with a hint of lime that really adds a dimension to flavor.   The neighborhood isn't the best, but it definetly is not "shady, or ghetto" in any way.  I felt rather safe, but i would NOT go on a first date here  lol.  Overall, go here and eat some good solid mexican food... it's just good when you're hungry, but it is GREAT when you're coming home from a late night drinking or clubbing.

My friend who's lived in Ktown all his life said this is one of his go-tos for Mexican so we gave it a shot. Granted, I am from the Pacific Northwest and for most of my life thought taco bell was real mexican. Anywho, I tried the carne asada torta because I read a review on yelp that described it as this delicious yummy thing. The truth is though, it's really not that great. Honestly, I still had my happy smile when I saw the huge line, and when people were pushing within the lines and were getting uncomfortably close (like breathing down my neck close) or when I couldn't see the menu , and I waited like 15 minutes in line just to order, another 10 for my single torta. Anyways, about the actual food; that wasn't impressive either. Yes the bread was soft, but it had butter? or some sort of fat all drizzled over it making it soggy, and there was verrrrry little carne asada and a sliver of avocado (no onions because i dont' eat them), anyways overall, it filled me cause of the bread, but I felt a little gross afterwards. Over-hyped.  I miss freebirds in SB.

So people say that this place and King Taco are the same because it's owned by the same people and they get their meat from the same distributors. For some reason, this place is so much better. The meat is less oily and the sauce tastes better? Maybe it's just my personal preference and the way they cook the meat. However, I would ALWAYS choose El Taurino over King Taco any day. I love this place so much, it's the only thing I was craving the morning after my wedding day! Happy eats everyone! :)

The meat is nicely marinated with some good acidity (citrus) and seasonings. It's not dry at all like El Gran Burrito. Not 24 hrs, but they close late until 3am... so it's pretty good. My husband ordered lengua and carnitas pork... and he liked them; he's very particular about his lengua and carnitas pork. Much cleaner than El Gran Burrito and feels El Taurino has more authenticity rather compared to El Gran Burrito...

Reliable, though not particularly spectacular, El Taurino is definitely a well-justified place to eat Mexican food. I've been here on several occasions, and two things stand out for me about El Taurino: 1) their carne asada meat is pretty good, and 2) their red sauce is H-O-T (and even THAT is an understatement)! Every single time I've been at El Taurino, I've only gotten one of two meats... either the carne asada or the al pastor. I've found that the carne asada burrito is pretty good. I usually get the "pura carne" carne asada burrito, which is roughly translated into "all meat carne asada burrito." For the tacos, I usually choose the al pastor meat.  If I'm really hungry, I'll get both. I've also heard from my friends (but have not verified) that the tortas and tostadas are good. Now, on to the hot sauce. Is there an equivalent to the hot sauce at El Taurino? Actually, there is! I thought it was nearly identical to the hot sauce at King Taco, which is SPICY as well. Anyhow, El Taurino has a much milder sauce option (in addition to the super hot sauce) if that's what you desire. The environment? It's a sit-down Mexican restaurant with pictures and props of bulls everywhere. Hence, the name "El Taurino" is appropriate... maybe too appropriate, haha. As one might expect, you'll see a lot of Hispanic people eat here, but I've also seen quite a lot of Asians (including myself, I suppose) pop in here to grab a bite to eat. The cost? It depends what you get. In my opinion, the burritos might be a little overpriced (I think they're $4.99 or $5.99, depending on whether you get the all-meat burrito or not). The tacos are $1.25 each (if I remember correctly). Overall impressions of the place? It gets the job done, and I've yet to see anybody disappointed by the food here. Is it a 5-star place? I wouldn't say so, but that's not enough to keep me from coming back to El Taurino.

I've been coming here since 1988 and it's definitely changed since..as far as the clientele. It's a lot more diverse but the restaurant is actually the same. A lot of the reviews mention the tacos. I would never come here just for the tacos. It's Los Angeles, you can get tacos anywhere. Every time I come here we order the same thing. A pound of barbacoa with consomme and extra tortillas....maybe an horchata if I want to be really bad. But amazing barbacoa is so hard to find... It's so tender when you get it and you make your own little tacos with onions and cilantro. The best is dunking your taco in the consomme. Delicious! So next time if you want to be a little adventurous and maybe you want to impress your date or maybe your just tired of carne asada tacos...order the barbacoa with consomme.

Know the lines. Line 1: order (know your order!) they'll give you a receipt and a line number. You go to the next appropriate line to pick up your food. The food: deliciousness! The carne asada tacos doused with the hot sauce must be devoured with a side helping of radishes. The Tortas: mmmmm! Just the perfect ratio of bread and meat.  The burrito: mondo heaven! and the reason for El Taurino's perfection is in the hot sauce: burning in spices, but the perfect combo to complete any meal! A must-have

Great place for a late night stumble-in. The tacos are no-fuss and straight forward with corn tortillas.  The quesadilla is good stuff, too.  It's a regular for the Loyala law crowd from down the street. The area isn't the most glamorous and it'd help if you order in Spanish.  You'll blend in with the crowd better.  I stuck out in a suit. There's parking in the back.  Try not to park on the streets because it's a busy neighborhood.

In the review I saw when I searched this place, a guy named Benito says, "This place is pretty good when you're sober, but a gastronomical orgasm when you're drunk." I couldn't have said it any better than that. And I don't give a shit about the burritos, tacos, whatever, because the only thing I ever get when I go here is the "nachos with meat" and holy shit, if I ever strike it rich I am going to airlift that place out of LA and attach it to my own home and demand that "nachos with meat" come out of a tap in every room of my house. I cannot even explain the intense reaction that goes on in my mouth when it reeks of alcohol and is filled with meat nachos and I begin to masticate. Even imagining it right now, I wonder what cruel god would place me here at this moment, so far away from El Taurino and alcohol. Don't eat here at night when you're sober, please. We hate it when you killjoys take up space in line.

This place was highly recommended by a couple of people so I was expecting so awesome tacos. Sadly, I was disappointed. We tried the carne asada, lingua, carnitas and el pastor. They were all alright, but none were really great. The tacos were just tortillas covered with abit of meat. I know I might be offending some of you, but I like my tacos topped with lettuce, cheese, sour cream and guacamole. Maybe I should have ordered something else, like their burritos or tortas. But I probably won't be going back anytime soon. Even though it wasn't packed when we were there, we still waited a good 25 minutes before getting our food!

I love this joint, it's nothing fancy but the Saudero meat with red sauce is bomb. The line is awful at any given time so now I just call to order, but that does not mean your food will be ready when you arrive, it just bumps your ticket up when you arrive.  Still, better than nothing.

El Taurino is the best for late night food. It's pretty far even if you live in K-Town but people don't really care. El T. gets pretty busy late at night with all the people swarming in. Parking has usually never been a problem for me but the lot is always full. Lines are also pretty long and sometimes it seems like forever (probably because waiting for the tacos makes the time go slower...) but you'll get taken care of. Don't worry. The place is pretty clean and so are the restrooms. There's indoor seating but if it really gets packed you can always eat it outside if you'd like. I do think that they should fix some of the tables because they have some awkward chair/table positions... I USUALLY only get their al pastor tacos (tacos are $1.25 each and burritos $5.00). And sometimes lengua. With red sauce. Their al pastor is super tender and flavorful and they put on the onions and cilantro and whatnot. Their lengua is also very soft and even though it's tongue I love it. I've tried their carne before and it's alright. Oh and I got the sopa before and to be honest, I hated it. Horribad. People also tell me their burritos are good, but I'm still sticking to their tacos. But yeah...Get the al pastor. You can't go wrong. Onto the red sauce. Okay. Their red sauce is no joke. It's GOOD but it's spicy. You need to get a horchata here too. Horchata's like a Mexican rice drink with milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, and whatever. For you Koreans who drink 'shik heh' (the sweet Korean rice drink), it's like that but give it some Latino heritage. :) Cash is usually better here but plastic is acceptable. Fun for the whole night + El Taurino = Instant Win.

Went here after a club. I knew the wait was gonna be long, but that was okay, I expected it. I got 3 al pastor tacos and wow, they were BAD. They were covered in onions. I wanted an al pastor taco, not an onion taco. The taste wasn't there even after I scooped out three spoonfuls of onions from 1 taco. I'm not a fan of hot sauce that just makes me cry, I like a little flavor to it. The horchata was good, though.

The only reason you get 3 stars, Taurino, is because your freaking carne asada tortas are so tasty. Doesn't matter what time you come here, expect to wait at least almost an hour to get your order. Went here this past sunday, before 7 and they only had one window open. Line snaked on endlessly, and even when they opened their second window, it took us about an hour to get our order. After waiting for what seems like days in line, you get up and order. For me that's a carne asada torta, extra avocado and an agua de pina. Don't be surprised when they say that they're out of avocado or your the agua, even when it's early in the evening. Finally, you get your order in, and now it's time to stand like a retard until your number is called. Hopefully you can hear the number being called over the rancheritas or banda music being played. Hopefully you are not too paralyzed with fear from the cow torsos mounted on the wall and evil Ms. Swan look alike clown that resides in the corner to actually go up and get your order. If you plan on making it a special order, like no onions, make sure you stay up at the window and stare at the person making it. 80% chance they will get your order wrong. Oh, and don't even think about asking for extra salsa. They won't give it to you. No free limes - you can buy them for a quarter. Be sure not to stare too deep into the kitchen, or you will see what I have seen - Tortillas dropped on the floor put back onto the table without even a dusting off. Their meat and salsas coming out of the commercial bags (PLEASE don't think that what they make is homemade). People who should be making your fucking food standing around like idiots letting the line get longer. To make your Taurino experience even more enjoyable, go around 11 on a Friday. It's the United Nations of drunk douche bags, where you can get hit on by gross people from all over the world. The one thing I do like about that is watching the Korean people speak Spanish. It tickles me for some reason. But why do I come here? Because that freaking carne asada torta is awesome.

Eh. Not bad. The tamales (made by king taco) were good. Beans were interesting. Hubby didn't think the meat was very good. He had barbacoa and the pollo. I thought the green salsa was tasty, lots of smokey flavor and enough spice. The red salsa was more hot sauce and I prefer salsa over hot sauce. Too much of one flavor, I guess. The service is odd but it wasn't crowded and it still took about 15 for our food. Not terrible but could be better given we ordered 2 tamales( pre made) one taco (not much to it) and a sope.  Hardly complicated and there was no one in front of us for ages. I'd go back if I were nearby but nothing to write home about. More like 2 1/2 stars, I suppose.

There are some things definitely worth waiting in line for...this is not one of them. It took half an hour to order carne asada tacos that came out sooo small. We ordered a carne asada burrito as well and it came out looking like a soft taco from taco bell! The best thing from this place is the salsa; pretty spicy. Basically, the prices are too high for what they serve. You can go to Mariella's Tacos and get something that tastes way better for a cheaper price.

I am so sad to say this but I have to say it; I used to love el taurino but now I absolutely hate it. You completely lost me and my many friends as your loyal customers. I am going to make sure that all my many friends know how bad you have become. We are divorcing you because you cheated on us by getting in bed with that monster called greed. How could you not give out water? How could you make all meat burritos the size of taquitos? if I wanted taquitos i would have ordered them. Worst of all, WHY ARE YOU SO CHEP WITH YOUR SAUCES? Why do we have to fight for them every freaking time? That's as ridiculous as the obnoxiously loud music they blast every night. And please, if you are not going to give refills on drinks at least fill it to the top! Another business that lost their focus as they got bigger... From now on I'm  going to el gran burrito on Santa Monica and Vermont. They have amazing burritos and chicken! They are generous with everything.

One word to describe this place: OVERRATED! I came here Late Saturday night after leaving a nearby club with my friends and I heard so much about this place and I was super excited to check it out. It was a packed house around 130 am. The way they set up the place is kinda confusing for people like me...There are a bunch of different lines going on and I wasn't sure which line was the one to order...my friends and I eventually figured it out. I decided to get Carne Asada burrito with rice and cheese. Also I got the horchata. You pay first and wait for them to call your number in Spanish and they tell you what window to pick it up at. The horchata tasted chalky to me. I don't like it. It doesn't have a smooth taste that I like. Their system here seems very unorganized. They call numbers out of order and they skip you and it could take like 30 minutes for you to get a burrito. They have a bunch of orders sitting around that haven't been called yet. After tasting the burrito I didn't like the tortilla they used; it tasted very floury and doughy to me. They skimp on the meat here. They put very little meat and the the asada tasted like it was drenched in lime. After a few bites I realized there was no cheese in it and so i brought my order and told the guy and he was arguing with me that my friend's burrito had the cheese in it and I took the wrong burrito so I checked with all of my friends and none of theirs had cheese so I went back and told him;and he still argues with me and he even brought his manager to tell me that it was my fault. Not only did they refuse to just add cheese to my burrito they kept arguing with me that I was wrong. At this point I was extremely annoyed and I just said "forget it" and I left. First off, Is it my fault they gave my order to my friend? No, I double checked to see if it was my order before taking it.  Second off, I have never seen a place so stingy for CHEESE! The workers here all seemed really unhappy to be there and it translates into the food. I do give them credit for their hot sauce; the hot sauce is good and has a good kick to it, but they were even stingy on that. They give u like one container of salsa and give you a hard time about getting more than that.  I will NEVER ever go back here again. If the food was good then I wouldn't be so mad, but since they suck and they are rude...thats a no in my book. My regular taco places in OC are so much better than this place. The only reason why I think this place is crowded is because its open late and people only go here for convenience.

For me, the only things that they have going for them is consistency, and that they're open until late night. I mean, c'mon, the portions are tiny now, the prices are the same, they be super stingy with there sauce and sides, everything is expensive, it's over hyped, and it takes a hella long time to get your food

I don't see what all the hypes about.. The food is alright. I definitely wouldn't wait in a really long line to eat it. My first experience was BOMB but I was drunk so the maybe thats why? The carnitas were so good that night but there was no tamales that late at night. My second experience was a hour or so ago. My carnitas was hard and dry. My carne asada was skimpy. & the al pastor was about the only good thing. I guess I'll probably only go back after a night in ktown when I'm drunk.

You know it's good food when the staff barely speaks English, and needs security guards for the 9pm crowd...or the 3am crowd! This is not a racist comment.  This place blows my mind. Also what blew my tongue out was their hot sauce.  I can handle spicy most of the time, but this probably made me sneeze 23564322 times and cry.  But the spicy is what made it so good! I just had a tamale because that's all the cash I had, and didn't want to each too much before bed time.  I don't remember if they take plastic, but I anticipate more pigging out, more hot sauce, more crying, and more napkins to sneeze in.  I'm so lucky it's not terribly far from campus.

OK, I have to revise my 'review'. I just got another Carne asada burrito. It calls me, man.   I'm not joking.   THIS TIME, I ordered ahead. You STILL have to wait 15 minutes to get to the cashier. BUT, she was just a LITTLE nicer than usual AND she motions for me to 'come over here'. Walks me over to the window and tells the food preparer, "He's next." Wow. you know what? It was FREEGIN' AWESOME!!!!!!!! The meat melts in your mouth. I know this can vary from visit to visit. It's MEAT. (I'm talking about fat and grossness factor). I seriously never order these pulled meats from restaurants because they are ALWAYS not good for me.  Too tough, etc. BUT, EL TAURINO CARNE ASADA. YES.

Any late night after partying a little too hard, lunch, dinner, if you're ever in the mood for some amazing Mexican food. The definition of a fancy hole in the wall. Top recommendations - any kind of meat on a tostada, pure meat burrito, combo burrito, and any kind of meat on a torta. The salsas are to die for - one of the reasons why this place is so amazing. If you're ever in the area and want a good Mexican meal, this place should be one of the top choices. The only thing I can say is that the prices are a little high for what you're getting. Very simple food should have very simple prices. Either way, I'm never too upset about paying a little extra for the food. SOO GOOD!

I really cannot understand when people say this is the BEST Mexican place they've been to. Maybe it's understandable after being exposed to a lifetime of Taco Bell, Del Taco, Chipotle and whatnot. But having lived in Mexico City for over 16 years, I was less than impressed with this place. I would say the food was average, or maybe even below average for my taste. I could get better tacos at a street stand in the dirty streets of Tijuana (and I don't even like going to TJ). And it's just ridiculous that you have to pay extra money to get salsa, onions or cilantro. That's just not the way a taco place should operate. I think the only good (or just above average) thing that I could find about this place, is how late it opens until. That's pretty much it. Oh and just fyi, no one eats "carne asada" tacos in Mexico. It's not even called that way.

Best Mexican food I ever had Their portions may be smaller than most other Mexican food joints but it gets ME full so I can't complain. Their sauces can't be beat, the best I ever had - spicy, zesty, and BOLD. so bold, you won't ever forget this place. San Diegan Mexican food does not stand a chance. You'd think it'd be better because its close to the border but El Taurino is as good as it gets. I would say King Taco is just as good, they're both owned by the same person.

I'm a big fan of Mexican food... and while I love the food at El Taurino any time and any place, I LOVE actually sitting there and eating at the location.  The decor is colorful, fun, and can be seen as just a TAD bit too much, but it just adds to the fun. There's just something wonderful about their burritos topped with fresh lime juice and a generous pouring of their oh-so-yummy hot sauce...  Throw in a gulp of their horchata, and you've got yourself a complete bite.

Ok, I have been there 3 times.  The last time was my final straw.  I went there and ordered the simplest things.  Nachos with cheese and meat.  The crappy torilla chips u find at a mmovie theatre or taco bell with the same crap cheese.  It's ok if that's what u r expecting.. but for 5 bucks.. thats crazy.  The biggest disappointment was that it took 35 minutes to get it.  If it was only 10 minutes, at least u might go up and take a shot at ordering something else.   I had a great chicken quesadilla there "ONCE" but havent been able to find something that I personally like.  The attitude of the employees could be improved by leaps and bounds.  Possibly a tip jar for the cooks/food deliverer?  Not that I am pro-tipping in these sorts of places... but if it helped them give better service... im ALL FOR IT. I will ONLY go back when I am in the area and have no choices at 230am.  I'd probably rather just settle for jack in the box or subway.. at least u can be eating in less than 10 minutes.

When I first moved to LA, one of the first things that people told me about is this Mexican restaurant. I am hooked to this place. I'd get a burrito, two tacos and horchata, and I'd still want to have some more. I believe spicy food is very addicting. They used to have huge burrito but I noticed it gets smaller and smaller each time I visited there. I've been trying to find horchata as good as theirs but haven't been successful except for King Taco. My mission is to find an authentic Mexican restaurant like El Taurino in DC area.

Ahhh the memories at El Taurino.  Stumbling in here after clubbing and seeing everyone you just saw at the club is something special.  We Koreans are lemmings... it's either pho or El Taurino...  hoodori was so last year... Anyways... besides the wait... and the ridiculously slow ordering process, i have to admit the food is fantastic.  I don't know if it's the alcoholic buzz that heightens the flavor, or if we are just starving from getting rejected by vampires "Korean k town girls." But walking in here at 2am brings back alot of memories...good and bad...  but the one constant is that the tacos and burritos here are excellent... the hot sauce is hot.  I'm Korean and i think its hot... so you been warned.  The only meat i get here is the Al Pastor...  it ain't Mexican food unless you have Al pastor grease running down your hands... also the parking is ok...  there is a guy outside selling DVDs to movies that are still in theaters.  there is a truck outside that sells the same exact stuff....but go inside and be warm.  Eating elbow to elbow with fellow clubbers, MS13 gang members, and other random LA VIPs makes this place great!   on a side note... i remember they closed this place down to renovate for about a month or two...so i got all excited when it reopened.  I swear to god NOTHING changed.  It looked EXACTLY the same.  On close inspection they got new cash registers and the mural of the bull outside was touched up....but still same great food and extremely slow service.

The eastside of Los Angeles is a hotbed of taco activity. From east LA to the neighborhoods surrounding downtown LA you are never too far from great tacos. King Taco may be the big name in town but when it comes to asada tacos and spicy salsa roja El Taurino stands right with them. In fact their salsa roja and tacos are so similar in taste and texture that i'm not sure I could tell the difference between the two. Which is a good thing because I love King Taco. But El Taurino has been around since the late 70's serving up authentic tacos, sopes and tortas as well as their signature barbacoa(goat)dish long before King Taco and for that I salute them as the great taco matadors of this fine city. The inside of El Taurino is decked out with bullfighting imagery with several bull heads mounted on the walls surrounded by paintings of matadors and scenes from bullfights. I've never been to a taqueria that had a bull head mounted on the wall that didn't have great tacos.What makes El Taurino's tacos so great is the triangle of flavor(tortillas, meat, salsa with major kick) .The tortillas are oiled just right, the meat broiled and packed into the tortillas, the onions cilantro and salsa roja(very hot) smothered over the taco. Having a bulls head mounted on the wall is a subtle way of telling the taco customer that they've entered hallowed taco territory. Most people wouldn't put much thought into the significance of a bulls head on the wall at a taqueria but I truly believe it's a display of confidence and I have admiration for such a bold move. If the tacos were not of high quality I believe I would be offended by this grand attempt of intimidation. But the tacos at El Taurino are a magnificent triumph in taste and life and holding one in my hand I feel as one with the Bull charging towards the red curtain of the matador, only to be slain. Because I can stop now and know that I have reached the taco pinnacle, held taco greatness in my hand and looked into the eye of the matador without reaching for that cold beverage.

El Taurino, great mexican food. When I first tasted their tacos it reminded me of king taco, then I found out the owner used to be part of king taco! Go fig! Everything tastes like king taco! There are a few things that sets itself apart from king taco though: 1. the burritos have beans and rice in it to add more flavor 2. They have tostadas which are GREAT! I think the tostada is a must when you visit here.   WARNING: red sauce will burn a hole through your stomach. At first I was okay and then it hit me like not other by the time I was done with my second taco! I was sweating up a storm. Go with the green sauce to play it safe... equally good.  I think the owner was going for a spanish flare for the decor since there's a running matador theme throughout the restaurant and mounted bull heads all over the walls. Thank you cows for the meat! You taste great!

let's get the cons out of the way -long ass line & wait for your food, but usually there's a truck in the parking lot that's joint with the restaurant -parking lot is way too small for the amount of traffic that flows through here -the burritos are small.. even I can have 2 can be a con or not -all the drunkies (guilty of being one of them) -you might have to eat on the trunk of your car since seating is limited However.. -easy to find -The food here is yummy -it's open freakin late/stays open on the weekends -they don't joke when they say "hot" sauce..it's HOT

Good authentic mexican food, I always get the beef tongue (lengua) and carnitas tacos, but everything that i've tried here has been at worst, good. You can order a pitcher of beer (Michelob or Budweiser only) or a glass of wine, but you have to order food with each alcoholic beverage order. Yes I've ordered a taco just to get more beer, and then not gone back up there when the taco was ready. Great for late night. Cool bull fighting decor everywhere. Cash only

I can't really speak to the quality of the food now, but back when I was in college I remember my Los Angeles-based friends took me here for their kickin' burritos.  After one bite (with their dangerously spicy hot sauce that literally makes grown men cry -- I witnessed it myself!) I was hooked. My memory of my last visit is still vague: I was completely drunk in the front seat of my friend's car but had the wherewithal to ask, "What smells so good?," when people returned with El Taurino in hand.  I didn't get a bite because I would've caused property damage to the car, but the smell made me regret a night of excessive drinking.   I'll definitely go back to see if the place is as good as it used to be.

For those of you who like a little adventure and no qualms of danger, you may have eaten at El Taurinos.  I like to tell people, that yes, I live in downtown Los Angeles, but I live off of Figueroa. I rarely travel east past Olive street and never west of the 110 freeway.  But I have been known to drive into unchoice areas, and I have never had too much trouble. Everyone in LA get cravings for carne asada or al pastor tacos. Just the smell of the meat and onions on the grill on warm, soft corn tortillas makes my mouth water.  I love tacos, I even eat the ones on the side street carts that may give you a all nighter on the toilet. Not too long ago, my friend Stephanie had such a craving and started going on a hunger induced ranting of someplace called El Taurino's.  Since I have never heard of the place, Mark and I was game to try a new place.  After 30 minutes of turning on side streets, semi-lost due to our friends "directions"...we found ourselves on Olympic and Hoover. Two Korean girls and one white guy in little Mexico...a little apprehensive at first, we tentatively got out of the car.  Pretty much, at night, it is not uncommon to hear gunshots, mingle with drunken hungry patrons and really scary, ganster looking people. Oooohhhh, but the tacos where so worth it. The meat is so tender and savory.  Lots of cilantro and onions.  But beware: it would be wise to ask for the sauce on the side. A mistake of having them put the hot sauce on the tacos had my stomach burning all night long. Inside, the decor is...authentic...? There are Bulls head mounted on the walls, framed posters of matadors and past bullfights.  However, on a hot summer day, I recommend ordering from the roach coach outside (same menu), it will be much faster and you can eat in your car with the A/C blasting.  Inside, its more than a little steamy, and the wait is long and chaotic.  If you can hear your number and understand Espanol, and you enjoy sweating it out as you wait, by all means, enjoy, but for a native Seattle-ite, the coolness of the A/C blasting in my face while I enjoy 1.25 worth of heaven is just how I like it.

Authentic Mexican Joint. If you can't speak Spanish though - it's a little tricky to order because the ordering process is chip chop quick. Once you get your order-  you sit down on a bench and get to work. Elbows on the table type of place. The food is flavorful. I can't say this about most cuisines but I confess that I personally like americanized Mexican food over authentic Mexican food.

Holy moly this place is the bomb!  I've been wanting to come to El Taurino for ages, but for some reason never got around to it.  Then finally a burrito-deprived inspiration struck me.  Although I was tempted to go with the all-meat burrito, a bunch of Yelp reviews had indicated positive things about the sopes, so I went with an al pastor sopes, and then a carne asada taco and a carnitas taco, so I could get the meat trifecta.   Awwww yeah. Anyhow, it's really hard to understand the orders when they announce them a) because they're in Spanish and b) because I don't speak Spanish and c) because their speaker is some radio shack POS from 1973.  When I heard a # that sounded like it ought to be "106" I went up to the counter and started looking for my food. After trying to pull teeth in order to get some freakin' salsa (seriously folks, why are King Taco and El Taurino so stingy with the salsa?), I sat down with 2 salsa rojas and 2 salsa verdes to enjoy my Mexican masterpieces.   The sopes was as good as everyone said it was...it's probably one of my favorite types of Mexican food now.  The al pastor was top notch too.  The carnitas was really tasty and not too fatty, and the carne asada had a great jalapeno/lime flavor to it, kind of like King Taco's does.  The salsas were also very tasty and appropriately sweat-inducing. I would totally sit on the corner and sing La Bamba for El Taurino food.    This place definitely hit the spot.

Sweet lawwwd almighty, the salsa roja was freaking spicy as hell.  But I could not stop eating my carne asada tacos.  All six of them.  one.two.three.four.five six tacos.   Definitely should have asked for the salsa roja and verde ON THE SIDE.  They are HOT.   Al pastor is yummy too.   The thing that turned me off was seeing the meat guy open a costco looking pre-packaged plastic bag of already cooked carne asada and throwing it on the grill.  Even their salsa comes out of bags.  Still good though.  And you know I'll be back.

As the out of towner- El Taurino was a must try for authentic LA Mexican food. Two things: the special hot sauce & horchata This place is BUSY. We went there at a good time, but around 3am I hear it is swarming w/ drunk clubbers in Ktown. Had a couple carne asada tacos- And had heart burn for a good 6 hours..haha jk. But really- prepare your stomach if its sensitive. Worth it.

Since I live in OC, I usually got my El Taurino fix after I hit the club. But its been awhile since I've gone out and partied (the younger, hoochie girls have taken my place at Cercle and VR .. lol)  I remember it tasting sooooo good. The carne asada burritos were big, the meat was tender and juicy. That with a large horchita and a cheese quesadilla was a perfect ending to my drunken nights.   Well its been ages since I've last gone, but just recently my boyfriend moved to L.A for school (Go USC.. lol) , so we decided to go back.   Was it always that expensive? 5 bucks for a burrito? Anyway, the service was bad and the food takes forever, we waited 50 mins for 2 burritos. Some random guy got angry because it took the workers FOREVER to severe him his pitcher of beer. I mean come on, I know the place get's packed, but 50 mins for 2 burritos? The max I've waited for my food from them was 30 min, and that was even after the club! So now their burritos are small and mostly filled with rice and beans, where's the beef?!?!?!? I had like literally 10 small pieces of meat. I was sooo disappointed. What happen to their quality... ugg Maybe I'll give them another try soon

OHHHHH...sweet orange-grease heaven!!!  Oh, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways...  Now, I am not  a fast-food, roach-coach, shady, hole-in-the-wall kinda gal, but El Taurino seems to be my weakness.  :(  The single best authentic/street Mexican food in LA open 24-7.  Yeah, I know of all the new "authentic" & chi-chi places that have supposedly been popping up all over So. Cal., but E.T. does. not toot themselves as "gourmet" or the next new fad.  The are what they are, and don't seem to want to change.   Yes...service is BEYOND atrocious at E.T.,  I never, never, never, ever had to beg for friggin' sauce and onion/cilantro like this!!!  I don't know who is running this place, but c'mon?!?!  This is a joke!  I have friends that will not touch or get near your establishment, no matter how much they love it, because they can't stand the attitude and horrible customer service experience there EVERY time.   PLEASE!!!  Hire some decent people that have your co.'s interest in mind, and change how they are trained to think!  But anyway, onto the good stuff...   The rojo sauce, oh Lordy, the rojo sauce!!!  This alone will be keep me coming back for more, no matter how badly they treat me.  I've been known to drive 60 miles in the middle of the night just to consume this fiery red sauce unlike any other I have ever been able to find.  Now I like spicy stuff, EXTREMELY spicy, I mean to the point where chef's come out of the kitchen to watch me eat because they can't believe any human internal organs could actually withstand the amount of heat that I request from them.  But this sauce can actually make me sweat, gasp for air, and turn cherry red!  Is it masochistic?  Yes, but oh, it hurts so good!  ;)

This is the brother of King Taco. Word on the street is that they originated from the same people, which I can believe since they have incredibly similar tastes. El Taurino epitomizes what true hole-in-the-wall mexican food is in LA, and I would vouch to say that its probably better than most mexican taco's I've had in mexico. It's the green sauce that is really the kicker for me. It's packed with flavor that supplements any type of dish served here like peanut butter and jelly, or batman and robin, or girls and jimmy choo shoes. I would recommend trying the all meat burrito, tacos, and the torta's, all of which are amazingly addicting. I gave them 4 stars because they are often times sheisty with giving out the green sauce, which as mentioned above is the kicker for this place! But definitely worth going to if you're drunk, hung-over, or craving some down and dirty mexican soul food.

Frankly, this place is so loud and the wait so long that I just take it home. It's good but nothing to write home about. And yes, they ARE stingy. The second time I went there, there were umpteen families with kids running all over the place and the smell from the bathroom overwhelmed the place. It's hard to go back after that experience. I have got some good DVDs from the guy outside on the sidewalk, at least.

**** THEY DON'T GIVE YOU ENOUGH MEAT IN THERE BURRITOS AND TORTAS, PERIOD!!! The food taste great, can't complain about that. What i will complain about is that they're stingy with everything and now they're stingy with their meat. Its like they don't like making meat so they ration out as little as possible to costumers. Their burritos are smaller and less packed with meat then King Taco, and King Tacos burritos are small already. I gave up on Taurino's burritos because of the amount of asada meat that they lacked putting in so i started ordering asada tortas in hopes that they would pack it with meat, but once again little almost no meat. It literally tasted like a avocado and onion sandwich with cheese. I wish i took a picture and posted it but i was so hungry. Place would be great if they check their staff into putting MEAT in there plates. I would've complained about it there, but i go my food to go. They charge you for extra hot sauce like as if they make it.. lol it comes in a bag and no body there pays for it so.....? COME ON TAURINO! CAN SOMEONE IMPORTANT FROM CORPORATE TAURINO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ALREADY!!

Oh man, this place is so good. Very authentic (or so I think) Mexican food, with awesome prices.  So yummy. Whenever I came by with the co-workers, I always ordered 3 tacos - tacos al pastor por favor - for $5-$6 bucks!! Also, the menu is so extensive!  Tacos, burritos, tortas, tamales, tostadas, the list goes on. Don't forget to get their salsas, very spicy, but very good. My mouth is drooling as I type. Beware of the following items before going: - Cash only - No free cups of water.  So either bottled water, sodas, beer, or horchata. - This place can get crowded fast.  make sure you grab the nearest empty table! - It is hard to hear my number called, especially when they call it in Spanish  :( - Not exactly located in the best part of town Other than the minor items listed above, this place is awesome! I love yummy, cheap, food.

I freaking love this place[not anymore]. It makes me wish I lived in Mexico. It also makes me wish I went to USC because apparently everyone at that school loves them some El Taurino. We only go there after 9, and eat in the parking lot--we're not ashamed. I love the burritos, the tacos...yum. I like to tear apart the tortillas and make two tacos out of one...Mwahhaahha! I hate eating inside because all the god damn hispanics try to fight with you over the dumbest, most petty things (relax son, I'm hispanic). It's not like you can get a table anyway. I'm taking away one star because the burritos aren't as good as they used to be. Note: Before I had rated this 3 stars, but now just 3 because I think King Taco is better (for the grease)--and no, it's not the same thing.

So far, I've had the burritos (carne asada, carnitas), tacos (carne asada, carnitas, lengua), torta, sopes, tamales. Everything is great! I don't love the tortas or the lengua tacos. It's not bad, but just not my thing. Otherwise, I always have a burrito and/or taco.... hmmm so juicy. I just discovered the sopes and I'm HOOKED. The beans, the cheese...ohhhhhh... i'm headed there now! bye! Btw, a yelper's tip from me to you? stay away from the all meat burrito. Sure, it's tasty as hell, but talk about a one way trip to cardiac disease!

This use to be my favorite Mexican food in all of LA and would argue with anyone about how tasty it is; however they lose stars because they've shrank their food so much over the past few years. Go back to your old ways and raise the price for all I care; just don't get stingy and expect customers to not notice. However, still the best burrito, tacos and tortas in town.

Great place to try out your gringo Spanish 101.  Don't come for the tacos.  Try a torta, sopes, or tostada, the al pastor is amazing, the tortas come with these caramelized onions that are out of this world.  The toastadas are piled high with refried beans choice of meat lettuce tomatoes avocado and cheese.  They are known for their short rib special which I've yet to try.  Birria on weekends also and cheap beer on tap, Budweiser I think, but what the heck you didn't come for the beer. Be prepared to wait.  You could be the only person in the place and you will wait.

El Taurino is part of my life. from waking up from a long car ride home to find my dad asking me how many tacos I wanted, to late night munchie raids with my friends. I have been raised on these tacos and burritos, and will forever be my benchmark for any other taco I ever eat. This place is so much a part of me that my parents used to come here after a night out with friends when they were my age. I'm so dedicated to this place's tacos and burritos that only within the year I have been venturing and tried the different things on the menu.

A place to come and eat with friends and family. El T is always packed because of their reputation and amazing chef skills. with a truck in the back and a restaurant, this place is poppin.   their orchata(correct spelling?) is so amazing. cinamon swirls and creaminess ride around in your mouth as it enters the throat and eventually into the depths of your stomach.  their tacos are a bite size of happiness. like a peace of a cloud that is always meant to bring joy to the taco bearer.  their quesadillas are a chessy way to enjoy time.   so many other things on the menu are just so good and a good price that this place just might make it to my wedding catering tables.

I've driven by this place so many times, never gave it a second thought. but then, i needed food between here and there and yelp told me to go to El Taurino. the location is pretty bad, but when i went there were two "cops" with guns in the parking lot and a security guard inside with a gun. pretty tight for a taco shop. but i felt safe and the place was filled with good mix of people. i ordered an al pastor taco, carnitas taco, and a carne asada torta, all  with everything and hot sauce. thanks to reading about this ahead of time, i knew to take my receipt to the window with the matching number. i would have never known. i got the food, finished my drive and dug in. the torta was awesome. the carne asada was perfect, juicy and full of flavor. i don't know what "everything" was on my torta, but i loved it all. the bread was so good. i forget how good mexican sandwiches are. after that i go for the carnitas taco. its good, not the best, but i ate it all. and lastly was the al pastor taco. this was so good! i have no idea what sauce they used but it was damn good. next time, I'm getting al pastor burrito. i wish i knew about this place last year when i lived right there.

We all have.  El Taurino does it for me.  I fiend tacos like no other, I might be Mexican.  I've done more han solo trips to El Taurino than any other Mexican restaurants.  I've pulled off Hoover & the 10 for El Taurino and I don't even think I was hungry. El Taurino has the greatest red sauce (salsa roja). El Taurino also make the best buche taco (I don't really know what that is except that it's something internal and delish). If you entertain the idea of drunk-face people watch, El Taurino is also great as it is open late nights, weekends, etc.  A taco truck in their parking lot, serving the best Mexican food to young Hollywood, genius idea. Did I mention they have a great red salsa? If you come here expecting the best Carne Asada, it might NOT be a 5-star call for you.  However, if lengua, buche, and cabeza tacos are right up your alley, this may be a 6-star call. My only knock, no refills.  How in the world are you going to make a sweat dripping hot sauce and no refills?

You better make sure you can speak Spanish because thats the language you have to order here to get your food. The menu can be confusing, but I always go for the all carne burrito, and extra hot sauce. The meat is just perfectly tender and juicy, and the hot sauce is suuupperr hot but adds a bursting of flavor. I know lots of my buddies like the tortas too. Just go here, enjoy as authentic as it gets.

This place has the best tacos - so good that I just have to come and get some tacos when I crave for it, no matter how far I have to drive (it's 30+ miles away from where I live now). This is a good place to satisfy your cravings after yet another great Trojan football game (or if you're just hungry, period). I'm not too crazy about the constant line, which makes me wonder if it's caused by the overwhelming number of crowds, or inefficiently-run kitchen. Another thing I'm not crazy about: their tamales, which looks like "outsourced" tamales. Other than that, this place is golden!

This place hits the spot for me.   I love their carne asada tacos/burritos... and the red hot sauce is so flavorful, but it's SUPER spicy... the spiciness lingers for a WHILE... you can't even wash it down with a full cup of YUMMY horchata.

Damn good food! I have been visiting El Taurino for 15 years now. Perfect late night spot after clubbing in downtown or Silver Lake. This place has it all! Restaurant, a taco truck outside at the parking lot, and a wide variety of tacos, burritos, you name it. If you want great tacos, burritos piled with your choice of seasoned, greasy, carnitas, carne asada, lengue, adobo, washed down with some draft beer, you have come to the right place. Right off Olympic Blvd at Hoover, a place for genuine Mexican treats. Most patrons are Mexican if that tells you anything. Pros: Tacos, burritos: EXCELLENT Cons: Wait can sometimes be a hassle on a weekend night.

Stick with the tried and true and you will be loving it through and through... I love coming to this place.  it's packed at night, so i try to hit a lunch crowd.  Their Red Sauce is to die for unless it kills you first.   Order their burritos all meat with rice, lettuce and cheese.  Beans make it to heavey and you can loose the taste. Love their tacos, can't get enough.  The meat is great, they are small and tasty.  Again, you pop them in and they are so tender and good. I'm starting to become a torta fan, and have had their pork torta.  It's not healthy, but a taste of excellence.  Juicy Juicy, mmmmmm.mmmm.... When you go, you better know how to count in spanish, cause you can lose your order if you don't pay attention. Bring friends!

Their red sauce almost killed my friend. He ate till his face was red, his eyes watered, and sweat poured down his face. And then ate some more. Apparently this is the same owner as King Taco. So check out my review for King Taco in El Monte. Bottom line: Chicken taco is incredible.

MOST LEGIT TACOS EVERRR!! I lived in San Diego for 5 years and they can't even compare to all them -bertos shops and Old Town!! Over the years, theres been a sharp increase in the number of Koreans but don't let that bother you. I think it might be because of El Taurino's spicy ass hot sauce. Koreans love hot sauce! Taurino's hot sauce is "mind blowing hot" and amazing!!! I can never find the same level of spiciness in any other mexican taco shops! The tacos are sooo gooodd!! I hardly ever TO-GO restaurant food but always prefer to take these tacos to-go because the place is so packed! Regardless, the tacos are still EXCELLENT and HOT when I eat them at home. The meat isn't like short rib tender but really good. I can't find any other tacos that come close to these. I highly recommend you go try them! But I do warn you, the wait can be a b***h but WORTH IT!!! GO! GO! GO! I seriously crave their tacos every week and have been a regular for 10 years!! LOVES IT!!

Came here this past Saturday at 2:30 AM and apparently so did everyone else and their mamas... the lines inside were long, the lines outside were long, the wait for food was long, the whole damn place was filled and crowded (you were lucky if you were able to find a seat).. BUT the food was still as mouth-watering as ever and worth the wait!! Ordered the carne asada torta with green sauce (ALWAYS go with the green sauce here!) which came out to $5.21 (including tax). The carne asada is sooooo damn soft, flavorful and tender.  The onions were crunchier than I'd like them but still really good.  The bread could have been toastier.  The cheese was melted nicely with my carne asada. The green sauce--still to die for as always (I really wish I had their recipe for the green sauce, but alas ...it is secret). The torta was really large--perfect for when you've got the munchies or in my case, incredibly starved after dancing all night in Hollywood. Don't ever get anything con queso here (with cheese) unless you are vegetarian because all their meats here are worth the extra bucks as they are always soft, tender and flavorful. Left here very satisfied (despite the wait) and can't wait to come back for more!

I'm not the biggest Mexican food fan. I just love trying new things and new places. This place was recommended to me by a friend and I would probably recommend it also if someone asked me where some good Mexican food is in Southern California. I got the 'all-meat-burrito' which I didn't really like. My friend told me to get it, and I sort of wish I didn't. I thought it was all the different kinds of meat in one burrito, but it's not. It's just all the same meat in a burrito without anything else. This is just a warning. Get it if that's what you really want. The horchata was mixed well and I enjoyed it. I'd love to come back and try another item. The place seems like the most popular place on the block. Since it's open late, everyone goes here after the club or whatever.

Chicken Tostada - Something different. Tasted very authentic. You may or may not like it, but at least it is worth a try! Cheese Quesadilla - Average. Nothing spectacular. Carne Asada Nachos - Not worth it. Nachos with not enough cheese or meat. Oh, and that is all it has. Cheese and meat.   I got guacamole, but I don't know if it was for my quesadilla or for the nachos. The guacamole tasted more like cilantro than avocado. I heard the tacos are good. Small though, so get like three and something else. You have to ask for napkins and they give you just enough. Sour cream is an extra 1.25. They do not give out water, so bring your own.

After hearing all the hype about El Taurino, how it has the "best tacos ever", of course, I gave it a shot, and again, walked out displeased. I admit, the tacos were good, but they just werent mouth-watering excellent. I've also took an attempt to try the cheese quesidilla and tamale, and those were also very mediocre. Other than the interesting taurino decoration, and the fact that the restaurant was naturally culturally/racially divided in seating, there was really nothing special.

I think El Taurino is as good as Mexican food gets in LA.  It's definitely 3 1/2 stars.  I mean if we're judging solely based upon food, I guess you can say 4... but if you take other things into account ... you don't go there for the service or the decor. The wait can be really long... and the location is sketchy (it's in K-Town) ... but go there for the food.... The carne asada burrito (combo) with red sauce is simplistically awesome.  It will make your nose run and mouth burn but the red sauce is worth it. I love tortas and have had the chorizo y huevos and carne asada ones. Both excellent. The carne asada tacos are good too. My daughter loves the tacos. Regardless of what you order... for spicy lovers, be sure to ask for the Red Salsa.

If you want to get awesome Mexican food (mainly the tostadas) go here to El Taurino in LA. It's open 24/7 but I suggest you don't come after 10pm. Every time I've gone there has been some sort of post-police activity or some kind of fist fight that break out. This place is not in some cushy, fun location. It's pretty ghetto but that's probably why it tastes so good. Maybe? There is a huge array of things you can order but I would stick to just getting the tostadas. Every time I suggest someone to go here and they don't listen to me (I don't know why my friends don't trust me.), they always come back and tell me that they wished they had listened to me. So when I say, GET THE TOSTADAS, I mean GET THE TOSTADAS. Oh and definitely put the hot sauce on there. The pricing here is decent and you'll probably want to get 2-3 tostadas for yourself with a drink (not unlimited refills and you have to pay for water). You have to have a really good ear to hear what number they're calling because they're in Spanish and the words are really slurred/blurred by the PA system. The bathrooms there are single person bathrooms and they're the standard nasty grossness. There's ample parking depending on when you go (if you go right after the clubs in LA close, then you won't find anything since this is a hot spot for clubbers to go get their munchie fix). They take credit cards also, just not AmEx. And don't do anything stupid if you go there. There's an on-site security guard there 24/7 and the cops are always nearby. This place is also frequently by gang bangers so if the cops don't get there first, the gang bangers will.

Where I live, there aren't any good authentic Mexican restaurants. So when I visited LA I insisted we get some. I was really impressed with the food because it tasted like homemade Mexican food and was pretty cheap. We got the beef tongue and broiled beef tacos, some tamales, and tostados. I had never had a beef tongue taco, but it was surprisingly good. I wouldn't have guessed it was beef tongue if I hadn't been told. The tacos were pretty small considering the price but they were still good. I personally love tamales so I would probably get those instead of tacos if I go back (pretty much same price, but the tamales are a lot bigger). El Taurino is by far the best Mexican food I've had (besides homemade). I wish we had an El Taurino where I live!

This is the only taco place i know that I will go to and not have the taco because the TORTAS are seriously http://bomb.com. Yes, i said, BOMB.COM!!!! When i first moved out to Cali a good friend actually had a craving for it and drove all the way to LA (from Irvine) to get me her favorite Chicken torta (with everything on it and extra onions). And omyword, my standard for all things torta was established. Honestly, if i could drown everything in their hot sauce I really would. And although the morning afters are rather unpleasant... I don't care! give me a shot of tequila with it! At the risk of sounding overly dramatic.......... El Taurinos torta and hot sauce changed my life. Gosh, just at the thought of it... rainbows shot out of my ears.

I'm just going to put it out there, I'm pretty sure I'm addicted to El Taurino. I find myself craving it at least once or twice a week, and I'll make trips to the place at least once every two weeks because I can't stop thinking about it until I've satisfied my craving. I don't know what they do to the food, but my god, that Tostada had me at first bite. I used to be an avid sope kind of person but recently transitioned to tostadas and can't seem to transition back. The crispy shell, succulent meat, carmelized onions with sour cream and avocado...mexican food heaven. And let's not forget about their red sauce. Super hot but intensely packed with flavor, who cares if you're gonna pay for it the next morning? I don't. I also like to mix it up with the green sauce to even out the spicyness. After this review, I'll probably have to get some tonight.

I gotta say this is an interesting place...I was expecting this place to be less of an Asian hang out late at night but I guess late night mexican food is the new trend. El Taurino is practically in the middle of nowhere but busy as ever...great for late night snacks and hang over food. Be careful of the red sauce since it has this lingering kick to it. I didn't have much to eat here but my friends say it's the place to go after a night of clubbing and drinking.

I get stomagasms just thinking about El Taurino's al pastor. And tamales. And sopes. And menudo. I'm about to get emotional over this place. Overly serious? No, just serious about good food. I think of El Taurino as quintessential Los Angeles Mexican Food. This is the standard for all those other mom and pop shops, taco trucks and anything else in between. Everything deviates from here and nobody does it better. I've gone to some pretty bomb LA taco trucks wondering if I could find an equal but like an unrequited love, return to my original lover. ITEMS YOU MUST TRY BEFORE YOU DIE: - Tacos with everything: Al pastor, carnitas and buche (I like buche.. even if it is pig stomach..cooked in lard) (They're only $1.25 so you can definitely afford to get one of each) - Menudo: Don't forget to clean the bone. - Tamales: Pollo, puerco and queso - Horchata - Red sauce on the side for everything *You will be breathing onions for the next day and a half but that is a small price to pay for PERFECTION.*

This place was just OK for me.  Mostly I think it's because it's TOO authentic to the point where the vegetarian options are near zero.  I wanted a burrito and I started with a bean and cheese burrito which was $3.25 or so.  To add lettuce, onions, tomatoes, sour cream, guacamole, etc. they nickeled and dimed the price all the up near $8.00. Even with that, I thought the burrito was just fine.  It didn't hold together, the tortilla had holes in it, and so forth.  It was just a very average burrito for all the hype it sees on yelp. It was also strange to have armed guards both in the parking lot and inside.  I'm not from the LA area, but it makes me think I may have just survived getting out of a shady area unscathed.  It was probably fine, but I've just never seen armed guards at a food joint before.  :-) Bottomline:  If you're vegetarian, find somewhere else to get your burrito fix.

I absolutely love this place! I get their special dinner (the steak one for 9.75) and a bean and cheese burrito. The steak dinner is marinated in lime and is so flavorful. It comes with beans, rice, and tortillas. It can feed two people. The bean and cheese burritos are awesome. Tamales are from King Taco. All of their sauces are spicy so I don't battle over the sauce, but I do see people complaining about them being stingy. The only I thing that bothers me is the ambiance. Liquor flows freely here, and everytime I sit down to wait on my order the table next to me reeks of booze. The music is nice but those cow heads/half bodies (yes a whole half of cow) on the walls kind of freak me out. So I always order to-go. Do I think its a little overpriced and crowded like King Taco's? Yes. But good food keeps me coming back every time!

After seeing all the great reviews and after being stuck at the school library all day studying, we just had to try El Taurino just down the street.   We trekked into El Taurino, which has ample parking by the way, and ordered ourselves a mass of food.   I ordered the Burrito Al Pastor with rice & beans ... Nick ordered the Carne Asada Burrito with rice and beans.  Wait.. nope.. we're not done... then just to top it off we ordered the muy authentico (*super sarcasm*) meat nachos.  We also ordered the sweet tamale because well... quite frankly, we were tired, hungry, and dammit I wanted to try it!  Nick also ordered a large Horchata and I a large diet coke.  All this... a grand total of $22.  So cheap! I tried a little bit of everything except for Nick's Carne Asada burrito.  The horchata was really nice... I'm not going to claim to be a Horchata expert but it was one of the yummiest Horchata's I've had.  Cinnamon-y and yummy.  (My diet coke was pretty good too! Ha!)  My burrito al pastor had a really nice kick to it.  The burritos aren't overly big.. which was actually nice because I didn't feel overwhelmed by the food.  Just enough to fill you up.  I found the meat to be nice and moist... not too dry like some of the other complaints here on Yelp .. maybe I got lucky?  It really had a nice kick to it already.. but add on that awesome hot sauce they have... oooooh... that sets your mouth a-fire! The sweet tamale (and I'm assuming their other tamales) were wrapped in King Taco wrappers.. so I guess they get their tamales from King Taco??  Anyone know?? Anyways... pretty decent sweet tamale.  Just sweet enough, yummy enough, warm enough.   We found ourselves full and satisfied....food coma setting in.  Not good when you have to go back to the library to study.... Will definitely be back to try some more again!

Ahhhhh El Taurino..  The bullfighter. The best tacos and tortas on the East side.  Multi ethnic hangout for all of the K-Town peeps who like it spicy.  The steak is a leeetle tough but when chopped in a taco who cares and after a few cervesas you prolly wont notice anyway.

Remembering some rave recommendations on El Taurino, I whipped out my handy blackberry and read the reviews to the fella. Sounding promising, we made a quick stop at El Taurino. We ordered: - two carne asada tacos - one carne asada burrito - one con carne nachos - one Horchata & soda drink Total: $18 My small corn tacos were tasty & flavorful with it's slight spicy and tangy bite. I, however, was slightly disappointed with the amount of carne asada in the nachos (it was probably equivalent to a sparingly scoop.)  El Taurino's nachos are also served quite differently than what I'm used to.  Sans shredded cheese, sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo, and cotija cheese, El Taurino only covers its chips with queso sauce, period. Overall tasty, but lacks a lot of dimensions that I'm used to when eating carne asada fries/nachos. I took a bite of the fella's burrito and realized why he was so dissatisfied. Unlike my zesty tacos, his burrito had almost no zing to it. Just poor hints of flavor from the beans, even after using the hot sauce for assistance. The one thing that he was content about was the Horchata. It was pretty tasty with its stronger than average cinnamon spice aftertaste. Generally, a decent spot to fulfill the hunger, but not too sure about satisfying the taste buds.

One of the best palces to grab a carne Asada Burrito and some bomb a$$ Tacos. These place is by far the best placed I've been to in Los Angeles for authentic Tacos and Burritos, been coming here since I was a kid so I'm loyal to this place. And all do there prices have been going up  ont here menu, I have to admit that their food has always stayed the same and with a real flavor. The place isn't fancy at all it is station in the GHETTO but it not dangerous, the inside is decorated with mostly Bull picstures and statues but it is a family restaurant, however sometimes it can get REALLY PACKED and a bit messy and dirty but don't be discourage by the looks because the food will conquer you stomach. Try the Salsa Verde and Red Salsa because they have an authentic flavor, also when your are been called to pick up your order make sure you tell them not to put to much ONIONS in your tacos or in your BURRITO because otherwise you'll have more onions than meat or beans...I highly recommend it to anyone who has a craving for good Tacos or Burritos they also have other type of food like Sopes, Tamales, Beefs Ribs, Nachos, Tostadas etc...

El Taurino is the best Mexican restaurant I have ever been to, hands down.  They have the best burrito and the best sauce I've ever tasted.  I'll admit that out of the countless times I've come here, I have still only tried two items from their menu -- the all meat carne asada burrito and the carne asada tacos.  This crap is so good that I cannot bring myself to waste a trip here and order something else.  I just can't do it.  Someone help me. The carne asada burrito has meat, cilantro, onions and the red sauce all wrapped into a tasty tortilla.  I think the difference at El Taurino is the way that the tender and juicy carne asada is marinated and of course, the sauce, which is very spicy.  I've become used to it now, but the very first time I had the red sauce, my hand was shaking violently as I finished my burrito.  This is still the only place that actually makes my mouth literally water when waiting for the food. So of course, El Taurino is not perfect.  The downside: long lines and even when there are short lines, there is still a long wait to get your food after you order.  I have never ever seen this place dead.  But you know what?  Doesn't matter.  The food is just too good and I will keep coming back.  On Sunday afternoons, I usually see a female clown making balloon animals inside the restaurant.  It is kind of creepy.  Don't go on Sunday afternoons.  Parking is never a problem, as they have their own large lot.

The good old days! My dad would bring me her all the time or it would be Chabelita's. My fave were the tacos de asada or the asada burrito with the killer salsa roja. The meat taste as though its marinated in lemon. I remember my pre-veggie days! I almost killed my dad when I told him I was goign veggie. His reply was "ok I'll make you chicken then". As a kid I never noticed the cholos. Now I won't step foot in there or in that neighborhood with my hubby or without craping on myself from fear. I don't know about now as I'm sure things could have gotten better but we slowly noticed the burrito getting closer to size as a taco. My dad being in the food biz cursed out the manager one day and he vowed never to return...he was back the next week ordering up his usual.

I went here for cinco de mayo and I had a bean and cheese burrito and a horchata.  The burrito was great and the horchata was good too.  I just made homemade horchata (it took me two days to make it) and this horchata tasted just as good.   However,  I bought a temporary tattoo from the machine and there was an asian clown lady with neon yellow hair standing next to it, which was a bad omen, but I didn't realize it at the time, anyways, I bought a temporary tattoo and just as I was putting it on my arm with a wet paper towel I read the word "resin" on the back of the tattoo.... yes, the tattoo had "resin" in the ingredients.  That is not okay.  It's probably safer to get a real tattoo than one made with resin. No me gusta.

Quite possibly up in the 'best tacos in LA' category. The wait is a bit long, but always well worth it. Get anything with Carne Asada on it. The Asada burrito is to die for. The Al Pastor comes in a close second, but why bother with anything but the best? Drown it in red sauce and prepare yourself for a flavorgasm of epic proportions.

I've experienced way better at a taco truck. The al pastor is probably the only thing above average here. Avoid the nachos unless you have an appetite for Smart & Final tortilla chips covered in canned nacho cheese sauce. Honestly the food here is not that good. I don't even know why the lines here on late nights are about 15 deep. everything is overpriced and overrated! I also can't stand those damn CHUNTS who try to cut in line when your up in the front talking about "cam on mayn let me cawt in front, iz juz won taco". I replied, "Asshole! get in back of the line and wait like everyone else!". Just cause I'm not your kind doesn't mean you can get through douche bags. Anyways.. you should all be aware that people there will pull that sh*t so just respond as I did and they will back off. The area is sketchy so either park in the lot or come by during the daytime unless you want your car jacked and/or you don't mind being mugged! This place sucks though, I wouldn't recommend it.

The best sopes in the entire city. The corn patty is soft and fresh, the meat perfectly cooked (they have some of the best al pastor around) and enough cheese to cool your mouth from the lava they call salsa (its really good though.)   My first time here i got 3 tacos and 2 sopes, and the sopes were so good i have yet to try anything else. Im told the torta's are delicious, and looking at the picture on here i think i will have to try one next time. This is where i take anyone who wants to try really good Mexican food, or thinks tito's taco's are "the bomb."

I come here ONLY for the tostadas. A perfectly crisp... tostada thing on the bottom, carne asada heaped on top, onions, sour cream, and avocados? I do have to say that I don't enjoy suffering when I eat food so I typically stray away from hot sauce but DIZZAMN I will LAY THAT RED SAUCE ON. I've been told there's a bit of the same pepper in pepper spray in it. Dangerous(ly f*cking delicioso)! I DO wish four tostadas didn't cost $15 though, sadface.

El Taurino. Yes, el taurino. Not El Torito. I have to say "el TAUR eeeenoh!" to specify to people when i'm talkin' bout this place. it's amazing that not everyone knows about this busy, fairly large "hole in the wall". and yes, king taco is a good substitute. they are sister companies i believe? Anyways, please go here one day in your life when you are in l.a. I say, Please get carne asada Anything (burrito? yes. taco? yes. sopa? yes.).  el pastor is good but a bit oily/drippy/greasy, as are the carnitas. i mean, yes still good, but i LOVE their carne asada because i think they marinate it in lime. its' one of the best carne asadas i've tasted Because it has the strong lime flavor. i get it with onions and cilantro and no salsa (red or green sauce). but with sauce it's great too. i'm just not a HUGE fan of spicy. i like food to taste how it originally was cooked, i dont like to add salt or heavily spiced stuff to my food. sometimes i dream about getting el taurino/ king taco carne asada tacos/burritos but since i usually am in the south oc area, it's hard for me to drive to l.a. county JUST for mexican food. but man, if im in korea town it's so nice to drop by el taurino.. however long the wait is. which is LONG. i mean long. like u barely move. and u stare at all the people, the bulls, the plaques, and finally u can order, and then sit and wait. and yes it's hard to hear your number sometime, but when u get the food it's SO worth the wait, or coming home late and getting in trouble!

The best RED SALSA in the world! Who doesn't know about El Taurino? The mother restaurant to King Taco? More than the food, they have a top secret, super spicy red salsa that burns like crazy! I hear it has a mixture of a dozen different chili peppers and etc. It's got some tang and enough flavor to keep you coming back for more! The salsa verde (green) is pretty good too and less spicy. Besides the tacos, I love the CARNE ASADA TORTA! It has meat, cheese, tomatoes, sauteed onions, and avocado! I usually get no beans. Other notables are the tacos and AL PASTOR TACOS, burritos and the PURO CARNE BURRITOS (ONLY MEAT and maybe some onions and cilantro). 4 stars for the amazing hot sauce and edible food.

You're probably good getting anything here but make sure you get some of those tacos cuz gooooood deeeeeng.  My man, Young, took me here. As a regular growing up, Young knew what to order for our small party. He had us sit while he waited for our trays of food. Everything was tasty. The burrito was my least favorite.   Their sauces were amazing. Young had raved about them for a while and they lived up to the hype. Red and green.   For four people who eat a lot, we managed to fill up to a state of relative discomfort for about 15 dollars per person. You must understand that everyone in this party eats abnormal amounts; a normal person can get by on less than 10 for sure.     We went late and it was still pretty full. Good luck with that.

so back in 2010, i wrote this awesome review for el taurino and although its only been 2 years since i wrote the review, this place has been demoted from 5 stars to 2 stars. honestly, this place was bomb-diggity 2 years ago. nowadays, when i order a burrito, i'm like "really? where's the rest of the frickin burrito??!!" naturally, prices have gone up. its understandable. but it's totally not acceptable that portions have drastically gotten smaller. in other words, price goes up + portions go down = WTF??? therefore, i would like to retract the statement that i made back in 2010 when i claimed that "el taurino beats king taco hands down". nope nope nope. king taco is now in the lead and probably will be if el taurino doesn't get their act straight. i concluded that el taurino deserves at least 2 stars because it closes late (24/7 on weekends) and regardless of the price and their stingyness with their portions, it's still delicious.

What a great spot! Open late, inexpensive, pitchers of beer and no pretentious hipsters standing around trying to look bored. The portions of this place are probably the most accurate portions for ones meal. I'm not sure why, or how for that matter, anyone can eat one of those monster burritos, but don't expect to get huge portions from El Taurino. Excellent place to people watch and lots of great decor. I was half tempted to grab one of the matador pictures after I was done. It's the one near the back exit on the left wall. He's dressed in all blue. You'll want it too if you see it. Minus one star because there's no fish tacos. And that's just not cool.

El Taurino, what can I say. It's like an alternative King Taco. Food is fast and somewhat satisfying, service is bitchy but gets the job done. The only saving grace for El Taurino has to be the red sauce and green sauce, which are dry meat savers. I would return if I had nowhere else to go or if I had a serious craving for Mexican food and King Taco or Chanos are not options.

The line sucks dick, the food is mediocre, the meat is pre-made and comes in an airtight bag, the portions suck, I've lived in the area my whole life and i could name ten better places in a 4 block radius that are cheaper, more delicious, and provide faster service.  The only good thing is the salsa's, everything else is over priced.  How are they going to charge you almost a dollar for lemon slices, when the taco man gives them away for free...I'm no business major but im pretty sure this restaurant makes about 10 times more than the taco man.  On top of that what's the point of having a call in service if your order doesn't get cooked until you GO INTO the store and pay!!!

Food: -Sauce ($0.69 for extra) - Although the sauce here is delicious, I believe I've had better...definitely not worth the extra money for extra sauce. But HELL HATH NO FURY LIKE THE RED SAUCE....The red sauce is REALLY spicy (which I love), so those with feeble tongues might consider using the green sauce instead. -Tacos ($1.25) - Cheap! I usually get al pastor and carne asada, but more so al pastor. Sometimes the carne asada is a tad dry, so I often get the al pastor. Sopes -Sopes ($2.50~*) - They're more expensive than the tacos, but I think these are really tasty. I highly recommend these!! -Burritos ($5.00) - Tasty, BUT....small and scant of meat. One can find tastier, bigger, meatier burritos elsewhere. I don't recommend getting them here -Tamales ($1.39~*) - Some of you guys are TRIPPIN'...I think that the tamales here are pretty good!!! Moist, fluffy, a tad greasy, and bursting with flavor. And there have been instances when I was unable to order them because they were SOLD OUT for the day. I usually get the pollo ones. MmMMmm I get extra sauce for this haha. -Tostadas ($3.49) Pros: -24-hours!!! -Life is too short to take seriously, so I'm going to go ahead and put this here because it's all part of the ghetto mexican food joint experience! Being situated in downtown and within close distance to the clubs, sometimes you'll see drunk CHUNTIII ass cholas or dumb belligerent K-town girls getting down. Thuglyf333, but hey--you get a free show. -Plenty of parking Cons: -Packed -Because this place is often packed, you'll have to wait a good few minutes for your food, even if you only ordered a few tacos -Only bottled water Note: Back in my more oblivious years, this used to be my FAVORITE taco place...A few months ago, mine eyes have been open, and I shall in due time post a review for my new favorite taco joint (No, it's not King Taco just FYI)

It's so spicy and Addictive.....I always ask for an extra sauce on the side :) Caution: Depending on the time, the place can get pretty crowded and the line can get real long....so be prepared to wait a while.

I dream of your tacos every week.  I always get the al pastor (pork) tacos over the carne asada ones.   Nothing beats these tacos (so far).  The tortas are excellent as well!!!  My whity husband always has to get an al pastor torta when we go.   When you go in, order at one of the windows and go sit down and wait for them to call your number. (my spanish isn't all the great so if yours isn't either....listen CAREFULLY since they'll call out your # in spanish). Make sure you tell them whether you want the hot sauce on your tacos or on the side.  The red hot sauce kicks my @$$ if they put too much on it.  I'll start sweating and have a minor heart attack on the toilet the next day. Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the wait is so damn long!!   Sometimes we wait 30-40 minutes for our food. Beware....this stuff is soo good but it comes out of your pores!  I always smell it on my clothes and skin the next morning.   Oh..and take cash.

Great place with very fair prices.  The facility is large and very lively.  You should order almost everything on their menu - the reason why I say this is because their serving portions are small and inexpensive.  This means you can try A LOT of different foods/flavors from their restaurant. Recommendations: Chicken Taco Carne Asada Taco Carne Asada Tostada (I can't spell it - sorry). Carne Asada Special Burrito Also - I was surprised, their green sauce was much more spicy than their red sauce.  Regardless, I recommend asking for both the Green and Red sauce on the side, they compliment to food very well.

I live in New York City. Places like Benny's Burrito had led me to believe that I didn't like burritos, but I went to el Taurino to show myself what a real west coast burrito is. The carne asada burrito beat me around, and I liked it. It was painful to eat, but I couldn't as much as pause. I had no idea what I was even eating - all that was clear is that I couldn't stop. Add a bunch of mexican gangster types in wife beaters to the mix and you have something not worth passing up. Oh, and go for the all meat.

Food: This place is like the White Castle of Mexican food. Dirt cheap and tiny tacos, like tiny burgers. I can finish either in 2 bites. The carne asada tacos were flavored like beef in the perfectly oiled tortilla, nothing else, nothing fancy. Just hits home after a night of drinking. Wish the jalapeño tamales were spicier though. Drink: First time drinking horchata. Wow, have gots to have that every time I eat Mexican now, washes away the grease and spiciness. Service: Not much, order food at counter, like a fast food joint. Ambiance/Crowd: Predominantly Mexicans and then your usual late night crowd of buzzed/drunk people. Pretty run down layout, looks like how McD's would look like in the early 90's.

Final Decision: Overrated... I've definitely had better food elsewhere.  I came to this spot in search of a mysterious post by a yelper that there was some carne asada fries that existed at this spot.  Completely the opposite and the yelper does not know what they are talking about.  The food here was definitely not the greatest and was overpriced for some of the portion that I ordered.   Carne Asada Tacos - not bad, overpowering with the lime juice.  I would still prefer to go to Lincoln Height to a taco stand there that allows myself to add how much cilantro, pico de gallo and etc. Al Pastor Tacos - moist and flavorful, but again there seems to be too much lime juice. Nachos con Carne - extremely small portion and not enough carne nor cheese sauce.  The pictures on the wall were actual images of how much they would provide for food.  In nachos you would think they would hook you up with some guac and sour cream...but this one resembled nachos you would get at the Staple center or Dodger stadium minus the jalapenos. Definitely an overrated spot.  I really wouldn't understand how people can rate this place so highly.  They truly would need to visit the local taco stands or burrito trucks before they roll by here again.

El Taurino used to be good when they added more meat, beans, and rice to your burrito. The last several times I ate El Taurino, I left with a sour taste(it wasn't the red sauce). Next thing you know, the burrito sizes will be as small as taquitos. The question is: Why do I go back? 1. Everyone seems to be on a El Taurino bandwagon. They proclaim this place to be the greatest thing on Earth. When majority rules and the options are limited around 3am, what can you do? 2. Red sauce - this is the only consistent thing about this place 3. In hopes that the workers making your burrito will figure out quantity is greater at places like this.

I was debating how many stars to give.  Yes, I'm a fan, but the long wait kills me! This is the perfect place to go for a late night bite.  Just know that you'll be in line for awhile and then you have to wait another long time for your food.  I don't like the service here.  And I have no idea why it takes so long to make tacos and burritos.  Everything is there - all they have to do is scoop it up.  Geez.  Most people come here late at night after a night of drinking, so if you're planning on doing the same thing, just know you're going to wait.  One time, it look over an hour for us to order our food and get our food. The food is pretty good.  Although, I did see them open up a bag of cooked beef that they threw over the grill again.  That's just gross. They do have good hot sauce.  The red sauce is super spicy.  The green sauce is a bit milder - definitely full of flavor.   I really like their sopes and tortas.  Yumm.  Oh & they have beer on tap, if you're in the mood for drinks. I would have given then 4 stars, but the wait!  Oh the wait!

I love the carne asada here, its not quite as good as the tacos and burritos you'll get in San Diego, but its one of the few good places in LA. As everyone's mentioned, the red sauce is delicious but it's extremely spicy--so spicy it will make your eyes well up and your nose run (so eat with caution and only around close friends because you won't look pretty). The cons to this place are that its quite a long wait and most of the time there's a fatty line. I'm not really a fan of the horchata here and I'll continue my quest to find some horchata...

I drive past his establishment every day on my way to work, and I have never thought twice about it. On the outside it looks like a regular Los Angeles, run down building, sometimes accompanied by the El Taurino food truck, but on the inside it's a bustling, taqueria, rich in the aroma of carne asada and corn tortillas. I have only been here once during lunch time, and I only had tres tacos de carne asada, but they were muy delicisoso. I highly recommend this place for a taste of real Mexican food, the fresh home-made Mexican food your grandma use to make, while you wrapped tamales for 10 hours when all you wanted to do was watch Duck Tails...ok enough reminiscing about my childhood. I cannot wait to come back and try the carne asada burrito and sopes.

This place is just like King Taco.  I've tried most of the items on their menu...but I stick to their tacos and burrito.  Try mixing the green and red sauces.  Pretty tasty!!!   If you love, King Taco, you won't be disappointed.  I promise!   They have a pretty decent size parking lot.  I try to avoid the lunch/dinner rush hours cuz the lines get pretty long...  They used to have a truck in the lot, serving limited menu and drinks, during the busy hours.  I'm not sure if they still do.   Enjoy!!!

I have been a loyal customer for the last 10 years!! So I have some good insight into El Taurino. Food: 1. Tostadas ( A delicious crispy flat corn taco topped with carne asada, onions, avocado, crema, and mexican cheese. It is a messy eat but it is worth all the fuss. Before you know it, you will become a pro and eat around the middle saving it for last without managing to break the crunch shell in half in the process. ) 2. Torta (Soft square bread smeared with creama and melted cheese with carne asada, onions, avocado, and tomato. Simple amazing sandwich will have your taste buds asking for more.) 3. Tacos ( I go for the al pastor for these because I usually get beef in everything else. Its sweet pork reminiscent of Korean marinated pork.) 4. Quesadilla ( my friend Eric gets this with al pastor and its pretty bomb! I is really greasy but there is half an inch of melted cheese with delicious orange pork fat through out a toasted flour tortilla. So if you are in a cheesy mood get this!) Sauce: I HEART the GREEN SAUCE People are either advocates of the Green or Red... Granted both are tasty, but Green has better flavor. I say you try both and then decide for yourself. Drinks: 1. Horchata!! (Cinnamon rice drink) It is the perfect way to cool off your mouth from too much sauce! Its a good idea to shake the drink when you are almost to the bottom so you don't end up drink gritty rice particles.

I know that everyone says this place has the best tacos, but when I went to order I got completely sidetracked by the idea of fresh, handmade tamales! I tried both the pork and chicken tamales, and both were absolutely delicious. The cornmeal was a little sweet, a little salty, and very soft but crispy in a few parts, pretty much perfect. The meat was excellent as well - both types had great flavor from their seasonings. But what really enhances the flavor of everything...the red sauce! It's spicy and just makes everything taste so good! Get the red sauce for sure, but use in moderation if you're not used to spicy. If you are used to spicy, make sure you get extras or eat with someone who can't finish their container of the red sauce, you'll want it, trust me. So go get yourself a tamale, taco, or tostada (bf says these are the best ever here) and pour on the red sauce! Much as I like this place though, I can only give it 4 stars because there's this ridiculously creepy clown that sometimes stands around in the dining area - you have been warned!

Almost a four.  Their red sauce is spicy, the green sauce is good too.  Tacos are good.   BUT there's this lady employee...  she's kinda blind and dumb you see.  And I mean that in a mean way (she wasn't really blind or mentally dumb, per se.)   So I ordered for three of us.  I was waiting on window 2, and the other cooks were ten orders ahead of her and she was still making my order.   My order was not that large.  I got like 6 tacos, a nacho with chicken and a carne asada burrito for me and my friends.   Omg.. she made the nachos first.. and for the next excruciating ten minutes, she was trying to figure out what to make next.. She may have needed glasses.  But here's the gross part.. she wrapped up the burrito with just rice.  She unwrapped it.. and added onion and cilantro..  then wrapped it.. then unwrapped it again for cheese.. It's painful to read this now.. but it was disgusting to watch her wrap and unwrap the mess all over again..  And as my brother was eating it.. I was like.. is there meat in that??  He's like.. no..  I was like.. let me take it back.  She argued I didn't order meat..  Then she scurried to find my order thru the trash.. found it.. and she knew the manager was watching.. and she's like.. oh.. sorry..  let me .. and then she pretended to make another one, as soon as he was out of sight.. she's like.. give it to me (pointing to the eaten burrito).. and unwrapped the EATEN burrito to add meat.  That's seriously against safety and health laws. But I was thinking.. you know.. you look like you need this job.. I'm not gonna complain about you.  And I asked my brother.. you cool with that?  He's like.. yeah.   The nachos, since she made it first.. was soggy..  But you know.. whatever.. I could tell.. that if the food was done by any other.. it would be four stars.  But since I was unlucky to get that lady today.. I took away a star.. just cause of the horrid things I saw her do.

First of all, I'm pretty biased. This place is not just about the food, but the memories. That's so cheesy... ugh... but it's true! The food is pretty good. I must say that once you find what you like, stick with it. For me, it's the tostada (amazing! the crema with the avocado make this dish!) and the sope (both with the asada meat). I also occasionally order the al pastor quesadilla, which can be greasy, but hey... what's GOOD without the GREASE. What makes this place is not so much the food than it is that mystery green salsa. What's in it?! I say that the food can be overlooked because, in all honesty, they often jip you of quantity, and the quality that the food is made is inconsistent (dependent on how busy they are). Moreover, this place is guaranteed busy during nights and weekends. No exceptions, but considering that it's LA, there is always plenty of parking. Some negatives, they're often stingy with the salsa and other side items (i.e. limes, guac dip, etc), and you can't just ask for a cup of water for free. Lastly, come prepared to know your numbers in Spanish, or you may miss your order! Dang, I could go for some El Taurino RIGHT NOW!!

The entire drive from Santa Monica to El Taurino's my very drunk friend kept yelling, "HEEEEY HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO EL TAURINO'S?? IT'S SOOOOOO GOOD!!!"  While we replied, "Holy crap, for the tenth time we've never been and we're GOING NOW!!!" Luckily the drunken hype was true.  Yum, carne asada tacos! We showed up at El Taurino's around 1:50 am and were able to beat the after-club-crowd.  I wasn't TOO hungry so I just decided to try the carne asada tacos.  I wish I had tried other dishes, but whatever.  I did taste my friend's nachos (which were OK, not out of this world or anything) and tamale (which was GOOD). As everyone's said, the hot sauce is quite the creeper.  I didn't feel the burn until I finished the second taco.  And then my mouth was on fire for about 10 minutes after. Whew.

I've lived in San Diego for 7 years, and I've had a lot of Mexican food.  I mean A LOT, but this place has got to be in my top 2 Mexican joints EVER.  It is usually PACKED at 2am, when everyone stumbles out of the clubs with black eyeliner smeared across their face, but not to worry.  No one pays attention to what you look like, b/c the fumes of good mexican cooking are so intoxicating. Their hot sauce is the spiciest thing on earth, but so delicious.  I think they actually sell just their hot sauce.  Anyways, I've had the lengua burrito, which drips with juice.  I've also had the carne asada torta, which has the perfect amount of onions, cilantro, and cheese sprinkled on top.  I think I've had the carne asada burrito, can't really remember because I may have been half passed out...but it had to have been good. Although my judgment may have been impaired every time I was there, I just know this place is delicious.

AL PASTOR. Get the al pastor tacos. Everything else is so-so. Trust. The super intense flavor of the meat will just stay with you. You'll just want to keep eating despite the intense spicyness. The meat is well marinated and tender. And the additional of very spicy red sauce will burn your mouth but the pain is worth it!!  You'll definitely feel your insides hurt after eating 2-3 of these and the morning after may not be so pretty but so worth it! If you can't handle the spicyness, the green sauce is a good alternative - mild and tart. - not so hot anymore. seriously why be stingy with onions and salsa?

While on vacation, my friends brought us here after clubbing on a Saturday night. They were raving about their special hot sauce.  I am not a fan of anything spicy, so I didn't care for it. At 3am, there was still a long line of people, perhaps there after a good night of partying or clubbing.  I knew it had to be good if there were so many people there still at that time.  I ordered a SOPE, while the rest of my friends ordered tacos and burritos and we waited a good 20- 30 minutes for it.  By the time i actually got my food, I was so tired, I wasn't sure if I had the energy to still eat it.  We brought the food back to our friends place, while the others were waiting for their food. Some fell asleep, but some waited for the food. Everyone got that special spicy sauce.  It was funny because I was watching them all suffer from the spiciness of the sauce, but to my surprise they all continued to eat it, except one.  One said, "It's so spicy...but its SOOO GOOOD." As for me, I've never had a SOPE before...BUT it was SOOOO GOOOD!! I loved the fluffy tortilla like bread it came in.  I wanted more after my one serving!!   It looked simple, but it was delicious. I loved the flavor of the meat and the thick tortilla bread was delightful and different from the usual thin tortilla. Next time I go back down, I am definitely paying this place another visit!!

This place has great burritos, tacos, and tortas.  You can easily order several tacos and a tostada, then go back for a burrito another day. GET A TOSTADA!  Most people don't know about it, but it's like an open face burger in taco form.   Make sure you get both sauces, as one is spicy and the other is mild, but remember, the spicy red one will make you sweat. The service is crap, and you end up spending about $10 for the meal anyway with a drink, but the food is certainly worth its weight in stomach problems.

Wow.  I must say, I am supremely disappointed in El Taurino.  I have heard nothing but excellent things about this place, as its gotten more than 300 reviews on Yelp alone.  As a HUGE fan of Mexican food, I am constantly scoping out new restaurants in all the cities I visit and live in.  Los Angeles has been the clear winner in food quality and since I was in town for the weekend, I thought I would try to find me a new haunt. First, the line was almost out the door when we arrived.  It is an "order at the window and wait for your number to be called" type of place.  This was fine with me; I didn't much mind, especially since I expected the food to be amazing.  The line moved relatively fast.  We placed our order and then proceeded to a new window where we were to wait for our food.  We waited.  And waited.  And waited.  The dining room is filled with people milling around, most of them also waiting for their food, so there's lots of chaos; not the kind of place you want to go to relax.  Yet, again; I was expecting a great meal, so I was willing to put up with just about anything. About 20-25 minutes after we ordered, our food was finally ready.  I had been very hungry upon arrival so this amount of wait was quite long for me.  Once we got the food, I asked the guy behind the counter about our beers.  He then directed me to a separate line that was dedicated to beer.  My friend sat down with the food while I waited for at least 5 minutes more to get our beers. Alas!  Time to eat.  I was so excited.  We ordered two steak sopes, a barbacoa taco, nachos, a chicken tamale and a cubana.  We immediately dove into the nachos.  They were in a styrofoam container and my friend popped the top open.  Suddenly, we were confronted with thick corn tortilla chips covered in globby, yellow "cheese" substance.  It was actually shocking to see this, considering all the rave reviews I've been seeing on here.  I'm sorry; if a restaurant is good, it skimps on nothing.  Nothing; not even something as pedestrian as nachos.  But these guys did.  Not only did these nachos look terrible, but after a bite, we realized they tasted terrible, too.  They were stale, overly salty, and covered with this weird velveeta substance.  Disgusting.  Honestly. Soon afterwards we closed the container because we couldn't stand to look at it anymore and moved onto the other dishes.  The sopes were very good; we both agreed on that.  My friend did not like the pork cutlet that was in the cubana because it was too fried.  I thought it was fine, but the bread wasn't very good, and I did find the sandwich to be strangely moist and poorly put together.  The taco was fine, but it wasn't barbacoa like we ordered.  I think it was pork. Finally, they were out of the cheese tamales so we ended up with a chicken one.  It was fine, but nothing to write home about.  Yet, not as bad as the nachos, either. The hot sauce was probably the standout from this restaurant.  It was a smoky, spicy red sauce with absolutely excellent flavor.  If I had eaten just the sauce and the sopes, I'd have been happy.  But really, the rest of the meal was such a deep disappointment that I wouldn't consider returning to this place ever again, and I would strongly discourage anyone else from doing so. Sorry El Taurino.  Two thumbs down.

Known for their tacos! I always get the carne asada. Ask for the salsa on the side or they'll drown your tacos with sauce. You can choose green or red. I usually get both and put a little of both on. (You have to choose one when you order, and then when you pick up your food, you can ask for the other sauce) Also, they have the BEST tortas I've ever had. I either get carne asada or al pastor. I've even conformed my friends--who swore they would only get tacos. Now they have a dilemma of which one to get. (It usually ends up that they get both, no matter how full they are.) They're nachos are okay. Just melted cheese and meat. I prefer the crazy nachos with the guacamole, tomatoes, onions, jalepenos, etc....so maybe that's why I'm not a big fan. Also, they're burritos are okay too. The all-meat burrito is literally ALL-MEAT, so if you want meat with just some tortilla, you should totally get it. But I like the tacos and tortas better.

I got food poisoning.  My boyfriend and I love eating Mexican tacos so we decided to eat this one night and when i was sleeping, i woke up for a horrrrible stomach ache and ended up throwing everything up and was sick from the damn tacos! They were pretty damn good though, if it wasn't for the throwing up and stomach aches, I would have given them more stars. We ate the carne asada tacos and pork tacos. Never had that experience with tacos and I always get tacos from the truck.  I'll probably try it again because they were good tacos, but I'll be careful haha

Came here last night cause a buddy of mine had a bad first experience, but after hearing good reviews from other friends, he decided to give it another chance. And that second chance was enough to turn him a into a fan. The food is delicious. I had 2 carne asada tacos and an al pastor burrito. Their carne asada is one of the best I've had from anywhere. The al pastor is equally as tasty. Those with the red hot sauce = AWESOME! The red sauce is extremely hot (either that or I have weak and sensitive taste buds -__-). You'd think that super hot sauce would dampen the flavor of the food, but really, the spiciness gives a kick to your mouth that makes you want to eat more and more! Even though it's a little far, I'd definitely make the trip when I get the late night hunger. There was a line when we came in and the place is somewhat ghetto, but overall, El Taurino is one of the better Mexican food joints around town. At the end of the night, my mouth was hella burning, but it never felt so gooood!

So this gringo loves spicy food.  This gringo loves carnitas street tacos.  We ventured here for lunch here and its in an area that is certainly the LA you see from the highway.   I was told about the spicy and holy crap, is this place spicy.  For all you FIRST TIMERS, I'd recommend getting the spicy on the side.   Way more authentic than anything Baja and pretty damn good.   The carnitas are excellent. What we saw was everyone ordering the soup (served on weekends only I think).  It was okay, but pretty damn cheap. What makes this place special though, is the tortas.  Damn good tortas and probably one of the best I've ever had.

It is sad to think that someone would just want to make a fast buck out of the people, especially customers who've been coming to this location for years. A few weeks ago was the last time I visited this place and will not go back again. Why? Over priced and the portions are small. Go to King Taco down the street and you will get the same food. It is lame to think that because of the popularity of a location the quantity of a serving is drastically reduced. I ordered a beef burrito and all I got was air mixed with some bits of beef, rice and beans. Lame. Its really sad, and it is also very revealing. The place is either in financial trouble or it will soon start loosing customers because of the unjust price hike and ridiculous limiting of the portions.

Seriously? The only good thing about this place is the decorations. The customer service was awful, the food sucked, the music was way too loud, and the order numbers being called out was even louder. Ugh. We ordered the nachos and they were gross. Stale chips with fake cheese and overly salty meat, that's it. Where are all the other things supposed to be on nachos? My bean and cheese burrito was soggy and falling apart all over the place. Ew. Plus, to top it all off, no drink refills and a tiny cup of sour cream is an extra $1.50?! After we spend $20 on our meal? No, thanks.

This place never fails to reign as the "King" of Mexican food. This is owned and operated as the same owners of King Taco, but they keep this place original to the style and tradition that made them famous. Everything is the same; meat, sauce, ingredients. The only difference is that they offer Tostados, from where i remember King Taco doesn't offer that. They also have draft beer by the pitcher, but you should opt for the Horchata, Jamaica or Tamarind to wash down the hot sauce.  Be proportional with your drink, because they don't give out refills anymore, they actually charge you a full drink price. The hot sauce used to be fire, but i think they toned it down a bit. They also used to give out extra sauce and sides upon request, but now they charge for almost everything... I guess when you're the "King" you can tax whatever you want.

Have you perfected the art of Tostada eating? Yup. Can you enjoy your meal with the red sauce without sweating and wishing you bought a large horchata rather than a med.? No, I prefer the green sauce.  But once in a while I'll do it. Here's what I always get: -One Carne asada Tostada (or a Carne asada Torta on occasion) -2 Carnitas tacos + an extra asada taco if I'm really hungry. -Med. Horchata -play 3 songs (always devoting one song to Selina-Bidi Bidi Bom Bom) in the jukebox for a $1.   ... and I'm good.

Best Last Supper Ever. My brother and I pigged out here before he had to head back to Boston. Between us we got two tostadas, a torta, a tamale, and two tacos. Everything was sooooooo good. I didn't actually have any of the torta but in a desperate attempt to cool my mouth down from the hot sauce I broke off a corner of the bread. To my pleasant and fatty surprise,  it was soaked in butter. The line moved relatively slow but it was so worth the wait. I think the tostada was probably my favorite. It was also an unexpected learning opportunity for my brother because he picked up on some Spanish!

Hands down the best taco place in LA. The taco trucks are good too, but nothing tops El Taurino. Their hot sauce is SO SPICY I LOVE IT. But of course, if you can't handle spicy, you have the option of getting the green sauce which is bomb as well. The tacos are amazing, as well as the tostadas. Add avocado on them for extra satisfaction, but it costs extra. It's a great place to go for a late time snack run. People visiting LA should definately try this taqueria out because it is SO worth it everyone raves about it, it will set your standards. It's usually crowded, but the line is worth waiting for, if it wasn't, it wouldn't be bustling with taco hungry people all the time.

Delicious tacos or tostadas with your choice of meat (carne asada, carnitas, lengua, cabeza, etc.) topped with onions and cilantro with El Taurino's spicy red or green sauce. The best place to go for a late night taco run. Carne asada nachos are also a must, but the burritos and tortas are the same as any other taco place. My only con about this place is the al pastor. My favorite type of meat, but it's not the best here. Also, about 1 out of 4 times my al pastor is usually burnt/slightly charred. Why El Taurinoooo Whyyyyy?!?

El Taurino was recommended by a friend who over-hyped it a bit too much. A cheap and fast Mexican restaurant that is known for it's spicy sauce. I had the chopped pork taco which was small and dry, but still decent for $1.25. There were 3 security guards in the restaurant, something I've never seen before. This is not the best place to get a taco in my opinion, I have had better up in Silicon Valley  :)

I rarely give 5 stars but this was freaking awesome. AWESOME. I have been wanting some good taqueria food and so far I haven't had anything that impressed me. I shop at the Food 4 Less across the way and while I've seen this place I've never stopped by. Now I'm not sure I'll ever be able to NOT stop by. Firstly, pretty decent prices. I think the tacos and burritos could be bigger for the prices (I'm from the midwest, I can't help but think everything should be cheaper or bigger) but everything else was pretty on point. Secondly, the food was frigging delicious. So good. I wanted to try different kinds of meat and things so I ordered one of a  lot of things. I tried a shredded beef enchilada, a carnitas sope, two carne asada tacos, and an horchata... I ate it all through the day I swear. Not in one sitting... Anyway the sope was so crisp and the carnitas were a delicious combination of crunchy and moist. The enchilada has heaped with toppings including avocado and sour cream and it was to die for. The shredded beef was again moist and so, so tender. I saved the tacos for the next day and was confused by the tiny tacos that were only filled with meat. Pouring on salsa I forged ahead anyway and MY GOD was the meat flavorful. I didn't mind that there was nothing else on it. NOM. The only problem with this place is that you should expect to wait if you're going inside. They had a food cart outside for quick things but I needed to use my card so I went inside. We were there ordering and waiting for about half an hour. It was packed and there was creepy clown making balloon animals in the back. But I'm coming back. I'll wait for good Mexican food.

Today was my first day in LA!, and after a full day of wandering around the city my friend and I decided to wait out the traffic at this spot. Though the line wasn't too long the wait for the food was longer than expected just for some carne asada tacos. The tacos were good but nothing special. Smaller than expected, actually, and the meat could have been more flavorful. The best part was probably the hot sauce- I couldn't handle much of the heat, but it definitely added a nice kick. And the horchata was pretty good, very cinnamon-y. A solid start to what I'm sure will be a glorious week of food exploration in LA. Gotta say though, the best meal of the day was the homemade Bengali food my friend's mom left us for lunch (HI MOM!)

Just picked up lunch from these guys. Can't get a better lunch for $15 for two people. We had the chicken quesadilla, the carne asada sopes and the beef burrito. Soooo much food we almost didn't finish it. Everything was super tasty. The hot sauce is amazing too. This will definitely be our go-to Mexican joint.

yes, we've gone through ups and downs. right now might be a valley in our relationship as you've continued to skimp on the carne asada in all the burritos i've ordered for the last few months. but fond memories of when you actually had competent workers who didnt discriminate against the non-natives and would stuff the carne to the brim and toss extra sauce on the side for good measure never fails to bring a smile to my face. you still have the best hot sauce and carne asada tostadas. therefore ol faithful, my heart belongs to thee.

I really tried to like this place but I just don't the burritos Are really small and over priced the nachos are OK I guess. The meat they use for carne asada didn't taste good to me. they over price you fora shitty meal. i guess the spot is more important/famous then the food because it gets busy by mostly hipsters now(at least when i go) who want to say i ate at El Taurino. maybe back in the day it was really good but now ? NO

Just went here for the first time tonight. The food was incredible, and I think everyone else agrees with that.  The place was very busy late at night--even on a weeknight!  The lines moved quickly, and ordering and getting food was very reasonable.  I got to the front of the line before I knew what I wanted, and probably waited 5-10 minutes for the food. The place is loud, and full of people coming and going.  If you are looking for a nice relaxing place, this is not it.  The atmosphere of people coming and going and the loud Mexican music does make you feel like you are at some local dive.  This can be good in the sense that you will get that authentic Mexican food feel.  This can be bad if you were planning on relaxing and talking easily to other people in your group. Food - 5 Atmosphere - 3

Best Mexican food I've ever had.  I've been going to this place for 6 years now and have always gotten the All-meat (Carne Asada) Burrito with extra cilantro and onions and the green "mild" sauce.  I can't handle the red sauce.  Their horchata is bomb as well and sometimes I get the Carne Asada Nachos which is just cheese, tortilla chips, and carne asada.  It's still good though. The neighborhood is pretty sketchy (my friend saw a shooting right in front his first time there) but we go all the time anyway. Recently, it's been so packed... The last time I went (which was a few weeks ago), we waited in line for 30 minutes and then just left without eating. :(

El Taurino is so good! The food is consistent, but the prices are not! Even though the prices seem to go up every couple of months it is still worth going to. The all meat carne asada burrito (gotta add the 65 cent cheese) is super juicy and flavorful, and the tamales are spicy good!!!! My cousin and I once waited an hour for our burritos, but they were all the more yummy!

This is by far the best Mexican food place I've been to except for the Verdugo Taco Stand which is literally a family, cart and food. Anyways, I've had almost every type of meat here from tongue to pig stomach to carne asada and I can tell you that they're all good particularly the lengua. I typically get a lengua (tongue) burrito with all meat with hot sauce on the side and that will hit the spot! I used to like their buche (stomach) burrito a whole lot but seems like it hasn't been tasting as good lately - maybe just bad luck I don't know. Of course the standards are all good - carne asada, carnitas, chicken etc. But overall this place is a solid 4 - great food, opened late and even though its in a ghetto neighborhood - they have a security guard so now I feel safe!

Anyone who knows me... knows I whole-heartedly LOVE LOVE LOVE El Taurino. It runs in the family.  My family's been eating at this restaurant since about 30 years ago, still eats here, and we enjoy every single bite of it.  YUM! Yes, their lengua, al pastor, pollo, carnitas, cachete, etc are all good. The green sauce is all fine and dandy.  But there are two KEY words when it comes to El Taurino.   CARNE ASADA and RED SAUCE.  these two things = money.   El Taurino's known for their zesty, so-good-its-ridiculous CARNE ASADA, and their mouth watering (literally) and delishhh RED SALSA. My friends think I'm crazy, and attribute my obsession with this place to having been eating it my whole life.. but there's plenty of foods I've been eating my whole life..  So why is it that of all things, I have cravings for El Taurino burritos when I'm traveling?  and why is it that I have dreams of knowing how they make their red salsa so I could have a lifetime supply of it without going to El Taurino every week?  It's because it's freakishly good!  That's why. and as I write this review, I kid you not, my mouth is watering. :) My Top Recommendations: Carne Asada Burrito (no beans!  and no beans.. is KEY!), Carne Asada Tostada, Carne Asada Tacos (other tacos are good too) Other Goodies: Sopes, Menudo, Carne Asada Plate, Tamales (chicken) Some people are concerned that it's in a ghetto neighborhood, and yes, it is kinda ghetto... but eating at El Taurino is worth sacrificing your safety for. I do it all the time. Oh, and you can't forget the Horchata! :)

Delicious, yummy, good. :D Carnitas and al pastor are winners here for me. The carne asada is a bit too lime-y and watery for my tastes. Their tamales are from King Taco and are hit or miss, depending on how fresh they are. If they're fresh.. yum yum yum; however, I think they charge a quarter more for their tamales than King Taco does o.O The nachos are tasty, but would be better if they didn't use cheap, weird, store bought chips ): A carnitas burrito or a plate full of tacos never, ever fails for me here. The service is pretty damn slow, I don't think the wait has ever been less than 15 minutes no matter how un-busy they are. When you're craving a carnitas taco stat, this is an eternity.

Whats good about this place is the variety. You can get any type of  Mexican food you want. Tostadas and tacos and great, and the burritos are good just a bit to small for my taste. The best thing about this place is the hot sauce.. The red sauce is super spicy, and I love it. RED sauce on everything,. Overall this place is a good place to go for lunch, or later night after some drinks. They take card and have all the drinks you could want, even BEER!

If you are up for late night eats, and don't want to stand outside of a truck (Yes, in LA you can find some of the best food comes in mobile form), El Taurino is your place.  It is good enough that the Far East Movement made a song about this place. "11th and GrandView, thats my spot" is what you should be singing at this shrine of bullfighting. This place would get 5 stars if the CARNE ASADA did not come pre-made in a bag, and they weren't so stingy with the Salsa.  The taste is quite good however, but do not pass up the oportunity to have CARNITAS, and AL PASTOR in your favorite taco.  The HORCHATA and HIBISCUS drinks are also quite good and come in a thirst quenching size.  You will need them because that red salsa is HOT!

One of my friends didn't like the strong lemon taste, but I think it's just right... ^^  The red sauce is also very, very good... just be careful not to burn your tongue cause it's extremely spicy...   Can't say much about other menus cause I always order the soft tacos, just because I like them so much...hahaha...Also very cheap...

SOPES SOPES SOPES!!! I like it when the bread is crispy and not soggy. However the service tends to slow down, especially when you have a bunch of drunk Koreans who can't count to ten in Spanish. I had to wait for almost a hour once night just to get 3 sopes! On a side note, I once tried to go to El Taurino after a long night of frolic on a Thursday night, but IT WAS CLOSED!

I tried this place for the 1st time a couple nights ago with some friends. They had raved about it for a while, so I had my hopes high, and El Taurino totally met my high hopes. The nachos were tasty and the tostada looked very yummie, but i didn't steal a bite of that. But the star of the meal was the carne asada torta...oh my goodness, it was like a cloud stuffed with meat. the bread was so toasty and soft at the same time, the veggies were fresh (especially the avocado) and meat was seasoned to perfection. All topped off with a pineapple juice...it was a great meal. I look forward to going back and trying the rest of the menu. lastly...the vibe there was fun, all types of ppl listening to norteñas, Boleros, Shakira, and Michael Jackson.

You find as many Koreans as you do Mexicans at this place and for good reason.  The food is incredibly delicious and red sauce is something to have wet dreams about.  I met an Dallas transplant from LA once and this was the first thing he asked about when we started making conversation.  Inside, it looks as ghetto as a restaurant can get.  Their tacos, burritos, sopas, Especial De La Casa (carne rancho plate) are all drool inducing and delicious.  Forget the green sauce and ask for 2 reds if you're into spicy. My sister called them at 3 AM and asked if they were open, in which she got the reply, "we're always open *click."  We drive down there and see a bunch of drunk Korean people fresh out of the clubs sitting down at the McDonald's style chairs and tables in their best dress.   I've never been there at anytime where the line wasn't at least 15 minutes, so be at the ready for that.  Despite the decor, it isn't exactly cheap either, but the price is worth it.

This place is the bomb!  I normally go here for late night "after the club" grubbin.  Its cheap, tasty, and leaves you wanting more.  I've tried almost everything here.  I enjoy having their "al pastor" as the meat for all the dishes.  Carne Asada is pretty tasty/juicy as well.  The tacos are great, as well as the burrito 'purre carne'.  But the best dishes here have got to be the sopes and the meat nachos.  Now onto the most important part of the meal.  The salsa roja(red salsa).  Damn, this $#!! is spicy!  This is the primary reason I go here, because of the sauce.  Its very tasty and oh so spicy.  Don't say I didn't warn you.  Its got damn hot! 5 stars for taste, value, and spicyness!!!!

So my mother bragg about this place, we finally went and it was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT. i had read some other review that mentioned bad service but that didnt stop us, we still went. It was crowed, maybe its the tacos im not sure. she odered the Costillas and they gave her Chuletas which were plain, no flavor at all! and the portions of rice and beans were very very small. my dad ordered pierna adobada, he got  some shredded sweet meat that taste like BBQ not satisfying, he loves to eat and he couldnt  finish it. I asked for a Quesadilla and order cream, lettucce and avocado on the side since it didnt come with any sides HORRIBLE!: I could of got a better quesadillla at any taco stand, the avocado had some black pieces was past due and the cream they gave it to me a little sauce container, i wouldnt complain about the sides but they charged $3 for that. When i went to ask for the side lettucce they said the quesadilla didnt go with that even if i had asked the cashier to charge me and put it on the side they refused to give it to me since it was not on the receipt. BAD SERVICE!! If youre trying to get some Mexican food go to King Taco or  Tacos El Gavilan, its about the same thing, just that you wont have to put up with the bad service, small portions, wrong orders, looong wait and tasteless food!

Al pastor tacos are good, flavorful when hot off the stove, but not the most amazing.  Not as memorable as I hoped it would be.  Not sure if I would come back to wait 20+ minutes for these tacos.  If I do, it would probably be because of convenience rather than a craving.  There's also a faster line outside with their truck, but it was cold and we wanted to sit.

The BEST authentic taqueria anywhere in LA- and that's saying something given the number of mexican food joints in LA. Everything here is great (maybe minus the nachos), but my favorite is their flat shell tostadas and tortas. Their sauce here is key, you can't go wrong with either the salsa verde (green) or rojo (red).  Both are incredible, but I prefer the amazing flavor of the verde than the spicer rojo.   This place is great after a late night of drinking- but prepare to wait a bit if you swing by anything after last call on the weekend- it gets packed!

So many people had recommended El Taurino, and told me how good it was, but I never thought it was anything special. I lived right down the street from the place for a bit, and used to frequent El Taurino just because it was one of the only late night spots that were open. The line is pretty long, and food preparation is a bit slow. The patrons are mostly local hispanics, post clubbing crews, and USC students, which is kinda lame....and thats why I usually prefer to go to the salvadorean place at the other corner. I always get the carne asada burrito with the red hot sauce. I think the HOT sauce is what draws people to El Taurino. Its a habanero hot sauce...Don't order the red sauce if you can't handle spicy food, because it's pretty damn hot.!!!..The burrito wouldn't be that good without the hot sauce. There's plenty of better burritos to be eaten in L.A.

I have to say it doesn't compare to San Diego Mexican food, but this is probably the closest you'll get to authentic Mexican food in LA. After a late night of drinking with friends, this is the best place to go. The only down side to their amazing food, is the amazingly long lines... If you love spicy, the Red Salsa is the bee's knees. Also I have to recommend the tostada.

I am not the biggest fan of Mexican food but their tamales were AMAZING.  Currently developing a mad craving just reminiscing about it.  Please keep in mind there's a food truck outside that usually runs out of certain items but if you go into the restaurant they will have it!   The service isn't the easiest to understand especially if you don't understand spanish but a great trade-off for the cheap food!

I LOVE EL TAURINO!!! I eat here almost once a week =/  that makes me sound like a major fatty, but I don't care! The care asada TACOS are AMAZING.  You HAVE to have the red sauce.  It's a MUST but it's extremely spicy!  So be sure to ask for sauce on the side.  if you can, adding the green AND red sauce together is the best!  The red sauce is a must have and the green sauce is an added bonus ;)  (they're really stingy with the sauce, so if you only get three tacos you'll only get one sauce).   The NACHOS with cheese, onions and cilantro are AMAZING!!  THE BEST nacho cheese I've ever had in my life!  Don't get meat with the nachos tho, it makes is salty and you can't really taste how good the nacho cheese is.   The chicken tamale is good too.  And you should try the tostada at least once, but it's hard to eat.   YUUUMMM!!!!

As a LA burrito & taco connoisseur, I MUST write this review. As with most people, the first time I ate at El Taurino was after a late, drunken binge. When your drunk, anything tastes good. But what I've noticed time and time again, is that El Taurino is more hype than good food, or service for that matter. I just had a burrito last night, for the very last time. I pay $6 for a carne asada burrito, but what I'm actually eating is a "rice burrito" with some speckles of beef. They also charge for "extra" anything, which in my book is just plain stingy. El Taurino is not bad, BUT there are BETTER places TRUST me. Here are some examples: First off, El Taurino is owned by the same family that owns the KING TACO chain. Although any KING TACO is better in all aspects than el taurino. This is not a coincidence. Second, on Olympic and Figueroa there is a taco truck called "Danny's". These guys make some really bomb tacos and burritos. Also a great salsa bar. Third, on Vermont and 5th there is a taco truck called "El Flaming Taco". They make some unbelievable al pastor tacos w/ pineapple. The salsa bar is also very generous and fresh! I don't mean to bash on el taurino, but they had it coming to them. All the years of extra charges for this and that, people will get tired of it. and the food quality is just getting worse, as the company tries to nickel and dime on every little thing. When you start skimping on meat, you need to get hot sauce thrown at your face.

I moved to Los Angeles from Louisiana (the other LA) about 5 years ago. My idea of tacos and Mexican food was limited to Taco Bell, but man, did I love Taco Bell. So, when I got introduced to "real tacos" through the medium of El Taurino, my taco/Mexican food reality was shaken. The burritos and tacos took a little bit of getting used to due to the hold Taco Bell had on me, but as the years went and go on, I now consider myself a good enough taco-taster to know what "good" tacos are. After having countless tacos from countless different places, I've come to the realization that El Taurino's tacos are not THAT good. They're good, yes. But compared to the places with GOOD tacos, El Taurino's are just average. What makes El Taurino such a unique place is their sauce. Their Salsa Roja and Verde are the best around. If I could take their sauce to my favorite taco spots, I would (and have before). I've had El Taurino's tacos, sopes, tostadas, burritos, tortas, nachos, and I think that's about it. (various meats) I would give them a 3.5ish stars on their tacos. Their sauce calls for an extra star, 4 stars for El Taurino.

If you live in the mid-Wilshire/Koreatown area and have never eaten at El Taurino, you're doing something wrong and need to reevaluate your whole life. Literally everything here is good, especially the carne asada sopes and tostadas with carne deshebrada. It's packed on nights when the entire world is expected to be drunk, but if you can make it during the weeknights you should be able to order and sit relatively quickly. Oh yeah-- ALWAYS get a large horchata. Sidenote: I feel like no one is going to take this seriously because Los Angeles has some serious Mexican food contenders. You have to try this place if you really appreciate the most tender of meats.

El Taurino, what happened to you? It was my first time back since I've moved to OC 7 years ago. I went last Saturday night after a night out with my boys. It was 2am, the place was packed. It took almost 45 minutes to get our food. Ouch! I ordered the carne asada nachos. It was very disappointing! Just nachos with cheese sauce and small chunks or meat. It was bland and ungratifying. So I ate a carne asada taco also with the mucho spicy sauce. Again, not what I remembered. For we got, it wasn't worth the wait! Maybe next time El Taurino.

This is my very first post on Yelp. To choose El Taurino, the father of King Taco, as my first restaurant to rate shows how AMAZING this place is! First of all, if you want legit Mexican food, this is the place to go. The tostadas are to die for! They really make your taste buds explode with happiness (with the mixture of meat, cream cheese, tomato, onions, and avocados). And make sure if you like avocados, pay that little extra and add more onto your tostadas. The all meat burrito is great also! You can always get this at any King Taco, so I don't put it on a pedestal, but if you ever want a burrito filled with just juicy meat. Get this! Remember to Request the Sides: chopped onions and cilantro, spices (red or green). They really make your dishes that much better. So delicious! This place is a must :) Side note: the location is in downtown LA, so it's not the classiest place to eat at, but the food is BOMBS!!!

I would give them a 5 star  BUT the service sucks and they pretend not to speak English when u ask them for 1 extra salsa YES 1 extra salsa!!!!!! They made me wait in a 5 minute line just to pay .71cents for the best red salsa I have ever had in my life ...... I go there as often as once a week but learn to pay for the extra salsa I have had every thing on the menu and it's all great!!!!

The smell, it's undeniable and recognizable from miles away. The taste will satisfy all 6 senses. Yes, your sixth sense, which your stomach. For those who want authentic and fresh ingredients, flavors, textures, or even try a new type of meat, el Taurino is the place to go. I've been coming here for about 5 yrs now and I still do not get sick of the food. If anything, I crave it every week. After my friday church service, my friends and I always go to El Taurino. If you are a fan of sanwiches I suggest you try the torta, which is one of my favorites. If you like cheese and meat, get the quesadilla with asada or suadero. And if you get the guac, mix it with the red hot sauce, you'll thank me later. For those who want to step out of their food comfort zone and try different meats I suggest you try delicious meats like cabeza (cow's cheek meat), which is tender, juicy, and flavorful. (Reminds me of oxtail meat) Or you can try tripas or suadero which is also great. There's a reason I have been constantly coming here for 5 years. It's because I have never had a bad experience and they are consistant with the products they bring out. I highly reccomend for all. Enjoy!

El Taurino is like almost an ordinary Mexican joint of its kind. But they "exceptionalize" Yeah I said it, "exceptionalize" in the SAUCE. Go ROJO! It's rare to find such a good taco sauce and you never eat Mexican food without some kind of sauce. I dear you! OK, besides quesadillas. Oh... and it is better when you're drunk, because you can find forgiveness in the horrible lines, worse crowd and extremely loud Mexican music. I just wanted to add since I visited another taco restaurant. If El Taurino or King Taco sold their sauce everywhere they'd be rich as hell, but their restaurant would be just a good or bad as everyone else. Damn! Their sauce is the VERY BEST.

Carne Asada Tacos with their red sauce it one of the best tacos I have ever tasted. This place blows all the San Diego taco joints out of the water.  It's funny how San Diego residents think they have the best tacos since they are so close to the border. No f'n way.  Even my buddies that grew up in San Diego would have El Taurino anyday over San Diego tacos.  My only complaint about this place is the lines and the price. The tacos are $1.25 but the portion of rather small.  The meat is top-notch though.  No fatty pieces and perfectly seasoned and cooked.  Maybe all the San Jose joints should take a page from their book. God, I miss this place.

Korean guys speaking Spanish, college kids, workers, drunk hollywood go-ers. You really can't go wrong with this place. I go to school at USC, so after class I like to drive here with some buds and get some EL TAURRINOOOOOOO. Anyway, I love this place, sure it's an exact copy of King Taco, but I highly recommend the food over the other places around the area. Chano's is the closest one to campus but really, it's nothing compared to El Taurino. The biggest drawback is probably the ridiculous lines and waiting (but also a testament to how good the food is). It is ALWAYS busy.. I like the sauce, the red sauce. G'damn, so good. Combo burritos are great, carne asada tacos are BOMB, pitcher of beer is about 6 dollars. I think I might have to go there later...

As good as it gets for spicy carne asada tacos...been a fan for a long time...and I've never been disappointed. For the general palette the sauce will be too spicy, but for those that can hang...this place is as good as it gets for tacos... I've recently tried the Nachos and damn, they're good... I usually get 4 carne asada tacos with hot sauce onions and cilantro and one pork tamale...with extra hot sauce. I dig it.  I enjoy it.  I'm a fan. One of the better taco places I've been to....Highly recommended...

This place is by far one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  The tacos, burritos and Tortas are my favorite. Best carne asada in town. Just about every person I have brought here has really enjoyed their food. The Red hot sauce is to die for!! The biggest plus is that this place is always open late! Very late, I have been there after 3:30 am. The bad thing is that parking is a pain, lines are very long, it can be difficult to find a table,  and you have to wait a very long time for your food on busy nights. Its also not the cleanest looking place. But I love it!

Long line. Worth the wait and confusion in calling of order numbers. I come for the hybrid nor-cal meets so-cal burritos = delicioso. If you get the hot sauce be sure to get a horchata since the hot sauce is wicked H-O-T. Sat there is a truck in the parking lot to ease the heavy traffic.

WARNING- BE CAUTIOUS WITH THE RED SALSA!! ;) I swear this salsa is delicious but oh so spicy!! Just like I like it!! Anyway Im surprised this joint has over 500 reviews! love coming here for the torta de milanesa, its basically a breaded steak sandwich with onions, avocado, mayo and tomatos. Its really great and that red salsa just makes it more delicious!! I have also tried their asada tacos and sopes but didnt like them because the meat tastes like lemon and that kills it for me and the sopes well the masa tastes frozen and not fresh and since I love the homemade sopes I make its just not the same. The cheese tamale is also good their horchata and pineapple drinks are tasty! I dont like the endless wait time on a weekend so come during the weekday! Also they charge for extra condiments like extra tomatos, cream, cheese and lemons! Really lemons?! That makes me laugh!!! So overall nice place to get your grub on totally recommend!

El Taurino I heard lots of good things about El Taurino and yesterday I was finally able to go and try some of their tacos and their oft raved about tostadas. The tacos were great but not anything out of the ordinary. They are pretty much exactly the same as King Taco's tacos. The only reason King Taco's are better is because their sauce is superior. Anyways, the tacos were of very high quality. The meat was juicy and full of flavor and the size was perfect. It is what you would expect from a good taco. Now the tostada. I am comparing this tostada with the excellent tostadas they have at the Tortilleria Mexicana Los Hermanos in Brooklyn, NY. Now I know you're asking, "How could you even give NY credit for having authentic Mexican food?", but trust me, that place is as authentic as any other SoCal Mexican taqueria. The tostada here at El Taurino are good, there is no doubt about that, but it doesn't beat TMLH. The tortilla was fried to a light and crispy texture, and you can taste the flavor in it as well. The meat was again juicy and full of flavor and I appreciated the huge slices of avocado on top. What I didn't really enjoy was the big dollop of sour cream. I typically enjoy sour cream but I don't think it should belong on a tostada. It overpowers the rest of the flavors a bit too much. My advice is to opt out of it. The atmosphere at El Taurino is great. Bull heads, paintings, and the never ending colors of red, white, and green just set this place up as a legit Mexican food joint. I went when it was a bit busy and when its busy your food may take a bit to come out, but nothing to cry foul over. All in all, El Taurino serves food every taco lover would expect from a great taqueria.

Mmmmmmm. If you're craving some genuine/authentic Mexican food and you're in the area, va a El Taurino! Meat is tasty, veggies are freshh. Plus, you have to get the sauce (red and green!). The line can get long and you might have to wait a bit for your food to come out, but that's only because of the demand for the freshly cooked food. Love the carne asada tacos and combo burrito. Give it a try! :)

If you want to taste genuinely authentic, mexican food then El Taurino is the way to go.  Your stomach will thank you and your wallet will thank you.  I have always tried to get other things on the menu but always end up getting my favorite, torta con queso.  Other guests I have taken there tried some other things and they were blown away so I trust that anything on their menu is fabulous.  The only con is that it's always hectic in there.  As soon as you walk in, you feel overwhelmed with the line.  Last time I waited an hour and I was hungry so it wasn't pretty but then again there's a reason why there's so many people in there.

El Taurino is a restaurant I have been coming to for years. The place is owned by the same owners of the King Taco franchise so you can find the same tacos, burritos, and sopes that you would find at King Taco here. For me, it doesn't get any better than an all meat carne asada burrito with red sauce. The carne asada has a rich lime flavor to it. The red sauce is he spiciest sauce they have so beware not to ask for the sauce in the burrito, always ask for it on the side. The two signature dishes at this location are their beef rids with sauteed onions, beans and salsa and their "Barbacoa" which is slow cooked sheep meet. The ribs have a very rich flavor to them and the onions just help to make the dish better. The only downside to this plate is that they give you very few beans to go along with the meat. The barbacoa is only served during the weekend and you can always expect long lines during the time that they sell it. I have gone on Saturday and Sunday mornings and have had to wait over an hour and a half from the time I order, to get my food. To avoid this problem, I started driving to El Taurino at 6am to avoid the crowds but I haven't done this for a few years now. You can also order a bowl of "Consome" with the barbacoa which is the broth that the meat was cooked in. It was never my cup of tea but my wife loves that stuff. The only cons to this restaurant is the long waits and how crowded it gets during their peak hours. Some people will make it a habit of waiting right in front of the pick up window for their food leaving that area crowded and leaving you squeezing through people just to get your food, then trying to get back to your seat to eat. I even had the cashier reject a visa gift card because it didn't have a name on the card, I explained that it was a gift card and she just said "we can't accept those cards" so I just paid with my credit card. Even after this, the crowds, the slow service, I keep coming back because the food is really good! The way I look at it though, is if I am in the mood for tacos, burritos, or sopes I go to King Taco which is much closer. For  the ribs and barbacoa, it doesn't get any better than El Taurino.

If you're craving authentic mexican, look no further than El Taurino. Their great food starts with their meats. Mostly beef-based (the restaurant is aptly named), the meats are flavorful and tender. I particularly enjoyed their barbacoa, which is some of the best I've had. It's also very cheap, which is a plus. I got 4 tacos, a tamale, and a drink for under $10. I look forward to my next visit!

This is the best Mexican food on planet earth.  The roja sauce will vaporize your tongue, the tortas are a favorite, but the burritos are my most favorite.  The soup the have on the weekend is really great too. The only problem is on weekends, the wait can be extremely long.  Don't try coming here after clubbing yo.  I think I waited 45 minutes to get food once.  If you have, try buying from the truck outside.  Otherwise you'll just have to deal with watching everyone else eating while you stand there hungry as fuck.   I usually avoid Friday-Saturday unless I really need some tacos. P.S. Cabeza tacos. Awesome.

The only thing is that since they are so damn good and popular the staff is really rude, its super pricey (for food that come out of a truck) and always packed! But I am a sucker for their carne asada burritos and their tacos al pastor. Their hot sauce is amazing: *WARNING* their red hot sauce is suicidal!!! The green is yummy! Go ahead and try it, its amazing but be prepared for long lines, pricey tacos and some rude staff but enjoy every bite of their burritos.

Experience with mexican food, since birth. This is a bit too much for what I'm used to. It's not worth it. Everything is a bit overpriced compared to the quality of the food. Maybe the extra cash your paying goes to the enviroment. Everything is really well decorated and I have yet to ask about the authenticity of the photographs posted on the walls. Overall good place to dine though. I suggest everyone eats here at least once or twice, maybe trice if your loyal to your food. Tacos- Cabesa Lengua Tortas- Milanesa Asada Sopes- Naw Drinks- Orchata is made there. =] Don't put quarters on the disc player. It only takes bills. =/

Best Mexican joint for me so far.   Carne Asada tacos is the thing to get here, tasty, tangy bits of meat that I could eat by the handful in small corn tortillas.  Cover it with fresh onions and cilantro.  Then top it off with salsa verde (that's the green sauce, only green sauce I know of that has all the flavors of it's ingredients).  Or, if you're very picky like my guy is, you can have them leave it off and simply have corn tortillas and beef (which is very good also, especially when you have that "MEAT!" craving). And then, and then, I discovered their sopes. I thought their tacos were good.  But tacos alone I may  have given them just four stars, like much of the trend here.  But the sopes, oh man, the sopes...consider a corn tortilla that is three times the thickness, deep fried, but not dripping oil like other places, with just a small amount of refried beans (a major thing for me since I think that a lot of places use way too much beans as filler), a small mountain of carne asada, some chopped up cabbage, and what I believe is cotija cheese (although I am not sure, it's tangy white cheese).  So, so good.  Especially when it's freshly made and the corn tortilla sopes thing is still hot and crunchy...ohhh.... If you haven't tried it, it's a definate must! People who work there seemed unfriendly at first, but seeing a lot of customers yelling at them or just generally giving them a fuss, I sympathize.  And after seeing me order there so many times they are wonderful to me and always give me so much salsa.  Worth the wait!

Although I thought this place was preettyyyy overhyped, I still enjoy coming to El Taurino. My only complaint is that the portions here are small as heck! The tacos and burritos were freakin small! The times I've been here, I've had the all meat carne asada burrito, tostada, al pastor tacos, and  sopes and I was a little disappointed by the portions but they were still pretty good. I've had better al pastor tacos but that's only because I've had them in Mexico where they don't have the FDA to monitor what kind of things go inside the tacos. haha Everything else was pretty solid. The sauce here is pretty dang bombsauce too. I don't really think there's anything like it, besides the King Taco sauce. I heard from a friend that King Taco and El Taurino are owned by the same person. Whatever. Random Trivia FTW! While I was there, there was this creepy clown lady who made balloon animals for a small fee. My friend and I decided to take a picture with her. I can't seem to find the picture but I will post it as soon as I find it. All in all, come here for a good experience!

I'll just start off by saying that when I crave Mexican food, I crave El Taurino!!! The red sauce is AMAZING but let me just warn you that your lips and insides will feel it hours after you are done eating. I'm not usually a fan of Mexican food but El Taurino sure is tasty. I've had the carne asada burrito which is a tad on the small side but doesn't leave me feeling disgustingly full, which I like. On other occasions, I've tried the tamales and sopas, as well. While I really enjoyed the tamales, I thought the sopas were just okay...not something I would crave or order again but not horrible, either. I docked off a star for the ridiculously long waits at 1-2am in the morning and their stinginess with extra cartons of sauce. Not being able to find tables at 2 in the morning on the weekends is a bit inconvenient, too.

El Taurino=King Taco. Same company same dudes and dudettes. There is no "value" in their food. Food is good but these guys are the world-class tight wads with the portion and specially with the sauce. They'll only give you 1 sauce for the burrito and $0.69 cent extra per sauce beyond their limit. What a joke!!! Price keeps going up and the portion gets smaller. What are they thinking? Do they think they are the only MEX food joint in CA? Went there once and I no longer patronize. My hard earned money is now going to El Chato.

El Taurino is the BOMB!!!  Definitely go for the carne asada or al pastor burrito.  Ask for it "ALL MEAT" and you will not be disappointed.  But honestly, the burrito is good, but what makes this place worth mentioning is their signature, totally one-of-a-kind hot sauce.  NO LIE.  El Taurino's hot sauce is THE BEST!!  It's the perfect blend of spice and flavor.  My friends and I will literally drive for hours to this place in order to pick up a bottle of the sauce.

We have been loyal taurino patrons for year, but f the security. We stopped by in a minivan with our two toddler children and some drunk tried to start a fight with me as we were leaving. All the security guard did was wave us out of the parking lot. Sorry but you lost some long time loyal patrons. Adios!

I've tried pretty much everything on the menu, and I would say my all-time favorite is the carne asada tostadas. I swear they put crack in their hot sauce because it is super addicting! I probably crave the sauce more than I crave their food. Too bad they're super stingy with their sauce. I would go here more often if my boyfriend hadn't started boycotting the place for their horrible customer service!

THE BOMB!!! 1. taco and burrito are the bomb.  these are the only things ive goten from this place. i'm sure the other stuff is good too. 2. they use good meat, it's not that tough dry meat. vegi's are very fresh. 3. price is very reasonable. the only reason i gave this place one less star from perfect is because i feel like i'm going to get shot or mugged at this place.

Best tacos within the borders of the USofA, and I've driven across the country more than a few times... I'm not the greatest fan of Mexican food but the tacos here are just the best. And to boot, their green salsa sauce is next to perfect. The mood is nice and has a workers'/close community feel to it, which I enjoy. It'll come to something like 13-15$ including a pitcher of beer for two... You'll get STUFFED at that rate, and will have a few tacos to take home. I recommend specifically, the al pastor tacos, and the carne asada tacos... Beware, at feeding hours, the line can go out the door, and though it moves quickly you'll end up waiting a bit for your food to get done! I try to go in the dead of night after all the traffic has abated, there'll still be a crowd, It's that good...

The best (and most authentic) carne asada and al pastor tacos in L.A. Period. Lines are long, but they also have their own taco truck in the parking lot which serves the same tacos and burritos as the restaurant. The neighborhood is a bit shady, but they have security guards in the parking lot and in the restaurant.

The best carne asada burrito I've had anywhere in LA!  The carnitas tacos are very good too.  The meat is always juicy and flavorable.  Great simple Mexician food (tacos, tortas, sopes), cheap and open late.  It's in the ghetto off of Hoover and you could expect outrageously long lines especially in the evening but it's all worth it.  One of my top 10 places to eat in Los Angeles!

This place is definitely 5 stars but I gave it a 3 cause we had to wait 45min for the food.  Mind you i was the 3rd person in line to order and still took 45 min. Otherwise, the food (quality & quantity) is definitely 5 stars!  Just not sure if I want to wait 45 min. for my food.  I could have gone to a sit down restaurant and gotten my food faster there.

This place is has the best torta de Milanesa I've had. Really good tacos and always clean. Really nice decorations of the bulls on the walls.

Oh Taurinos, I wonder how many drunk young-ins have stumbled into your restaurant post concert, post club, post party, drunk starving and hoping in vain to stave off a hangover by filling their bellies with your taco-ie goodness? I cannot even begin to count the times that I myself have done so, partly because I cant actually remember anything other than finding your salsa scented wrappers in my car. Tacos, burritos, tortas, you know what you like, and taurinos is so good, its hard to go wrong. They have a couple of different salsas, if I order carne asada, i make sure to request the red sauce, if I order pollo, or carnitas, I get the green one, both of them are smoking hot spicy, so if you're not into that, or not sure if you're into that- get it on the side. They offer sessos, cabeza, tripas, and all kinds of other nonstandard body parts if your feeling like you need to eat something a little more risky than a plain beef burrito, though lets be honest and say that at 2am when the haze has cleared just enough for you to notice the slight throbbing in your head, your make up smeared across your face, the fact that your shoes are mysteriously sticky, and one of your friends is M.I.A, sinking your teeth into an all beef burrito, is about the only way to guarantee you wont wake up crying and swearing "I'LL NEVER DRINK AGAIN" . It also gives you something do while you ponder the eternal question that is "what the f' is a mind eraser and why the hell did I drink it?"

This review is short and simple. Best tacos in LA. Staff rings up order in Spanish. My favorite is the carne asada with green chili. The red sauce is like an volcano eruption in my mouth. i don't get tacos like these where i'm from but these are seriously the best ones I've had in the US so far. Yes they are small and cute so gorge as many as you like.

El Taurino has been my go-to Mexican food place in LA for years.  I was first introduced to it 6 years ago when a group of friends decided to drive out from Arcadia just to get some delicious Mexican food.  Since then, I have been a constant consumer of tacos, burritos, and tortas. Over the past 6 years, El Taurino has been the place where I have tasted and experienced all sorts of different "first's."  Here are some: -  Hottest Red Sauce in LA -  "Different" meat (lengua is delicious... imagine a smoother and more flavorful carne asada) -  Horchata -  Tortas (because of El Taurino tortas, I now judge every Mexican place by their tortas, if they have them) -  Tostadas (Crisp taco shells, topped with sliced avocados, crema, cheese, tomatoes, and onions) Each of what I have listed above is what makes El Taurino an experience all in itself.  The various different kinds of meat make ordering anything an adventure.  The sauces add kick and flavor that no other sauce can (TIP: try mixing red and green together).  The tortas are filled with creamy goodness (avocados and crema) along with perfectly cooked onions and a soft, warm bread to sandwich them in between.  The tostadas are the texturized brother to the torta, putting all of the same ingredients on top of a crispy shell. The only thing I dislike about El Taurino are the incredibly inflated prices on drinks.  I rarely buy drinks from here because they are so expensive and not worth it.  If anything, I walk across the street to the Food4Less to buy a bottle or even a 6 pack of soda instead of paying over 2.50 for a large drink.

ok, so i had heard that this place has the best tacos al pastor. i was ready with cash in hand. they were average. i was disapointed. i left. these tacos were just so so, not very tasty, not very flavorful, not really anything special. and, it's a King Taco...ahhhhhhh. not worth the drive to the east side.

el taurino is the pinks of mexican food meaning hype, long lines, and ordinary food. it seems like 99 percent of the people who have reviewed this place were either drunk, rollin, or just plain hungry at the time of consumption.  i'll admit i've been at el taurino at 2:30 am while seeking the hodori alternative and a chance to sober up.  but this food is mediocre. the carne asada doesn't even taste like beef.  i've had the two types of carne asada usually associated with tacos and burritos.  type one: the grilled, slightly charred kind.  for what it lacks in fat taste it makes up with the charred flavoring.  type two; the cooked and greasy kind.  although it loses the grilled flavoring of the previous type it makes up for it with grease adding flavor.  so the carne asada el taurino uses falls under the second category but isn't particulary greasy or tasty in comparison to the other type II carne asada i've eaten.  because of this  their burritos and tortas lack cohesion.   if people weren't drunk these reviews would be more realistic.

i'm a taco whore.  el taurino is not my fave, but it's pretty damn good.  and pretty much the only place to get good tacos after you can't drink anymore.  the lines are long, but it's as good a way as any to sober up, and good tacos will reward your patience. the last time i was here there was lots of screaming, and it wasn't because the burrito was too spicy.  apparently someone got robbed across the street and i saw a lawman sprinting down the street with a shotgun.  then the copter showed up.  then more cops shut the entire block down, told us to go home, and i was robbed of my late night snack.  sonsa bitches.

a long long time ago, i had the tacos here. from what i remember, the line was quick, and the tacos were fairly good. but as i'd JUST come from san diego only a few weeks prior, i still had standards. and i didn't go back, even though every one else kept babbling about how gooood the tacos/burritos were. fast forward three years. although san diego mexican food holds a special place in my heart, i can only faintly remember how good it tastes. how mexican food is supposed to taste. today, im a lover of king taco and michoacan carnitas. to me, these places are GOOD mexican food. and when friends from san diego visit and i take them to these new places, they give me funny looks and shake their heads sadly. i bet they'd shake their heads if i took them to el taurino. a longass wait for a small-ish burrito that probably isn't as authentic as they're used to. but to me, tastes like sheer heaven. carne asada burrito, hot sauce on the side, add cheese & sour cream. my idea of the PERFECT los angeles mexican meal. unfortunately, the al pastor here is NOT good, thus the three stars. go to michoacan carnitas for that. best torta i've had in LA. anyways, let me wrap this up. the hype is true. the line is long. the wait is painful. naked children will run around outside. parking is plentiful. prices are average to high. the food is good. the red sauce is extra spicy. the food tastes JUST like the food at king taco, except king taco is better, quicker. if you live closeby, check it out. that carne asada burrito is really really good. really. but it's no san diego burrito.

Super high expectations unmet! Actually I'm quite disappointed. I guess if I went in the early 2000's it would've been much better. First of all there's plenty of drunkards late at night, so annoying! Anyways, the food takes a good 20-30 to wait in line to order and then for your food to arrive in a hard to hear/understand speaker. Tacos/burritos/Mexican food should take so long to make. The tostada was pretty good, crispy and fresh shell, nice cheese and sour cream and avocado, but lacks meat. Also had a torta, which lacks meat again, and had too much bread. I felt like I was eating Mexican pan! LACKS MEAT is a HUGE concern for taco places. Hook it up please!! Anyways, I'm so glad I grew up in the Nard and work in SantAna, much better Mexican food here!!

Don't get it, meat is dry here. Had the al pastor, carnitas, and carne asada. Prefer El Parian's meats. Sauce is CALIENTA!! Horchata is very good though. Big parking lot, with security guard. Tacos $1.25. Marielas Taco's $1.25 are better, but not the horchata.

I wish I could give this place a lower rating. Horrible customer service - the ladies always look at you like you insult them with each word that comes out of your mouth. I ordered carne asada tacos (and of course they put an uncomfortably spicy hot sauce on top to destroy the true essence of the meat) and my cheese tamale had burnt orange cheese inside. When I brought it back to the cashier, she looked at me as if I had no right to complain. This place is awful and a king taco rip off.. Trust me and just stick to king taco. I'm sure I'll be vomiting in a few hours.

i dont like eating late at night.  but i accompanied my friends here on a post going out food run.  i sat in the car while they went to the truck to grab food.  turns out the friends wanted to sit down inside so eventually i had to exit the car and go inside. BECAUSE THE TACOS TOOK ALMOST AN HOUR. i was curious why this little taco truck had such a huge parking lot with security guards lurking.  and why there was no parking after circling a few times.  when i walked inside the loud restaurant i understood why.  i was told this was authentic mexican food.  but how authentic is it when every table was asian? anyways i dont know if the food is really worth the wait. the hoochie little asian girls are pretty entertaining to watch though.  especially since we got to see one group bitch each other out over ditching one another.  i felt like i was being transported back to high school.

For some reason, El Taurino always tastes better after hours, when everyone is drunk and ready to grub. You can always see the line forming at 2AM with all the clubbers coming in their hoochie regalia. That alone is a sight worth seeing in the middle of nowhere. All I can say is: RED SAUCE!!! My latina friend told me about the sauce and dropped a dirty penny in it. After a few seconds, she fished it out and wiped it with a napkin and it was as shiny and new as if it was just minted. So basically, I'm in love with a sauce that can probably burn holes in my stomach lining. The al pastor is amazing, and I always request extra onions... better to go with a Spanish- speaker: they treat you a lot better and don't nickel and dime you for extra sauce and cebollas. Make sure you have a couple sips of the Horchata if you plan on going my route with the hot sauce. I usually dump about half the container on each taco. Like I said, burn holes in my stomach, but tastes so good!!!

Stop #4 - El Taurino.  So it has been awhile since I've been to El Taurino but I always remembered that their al pastor was always good.  Yes, once again, these tacos were staples for the many nights that my buddies and I left the Korean night scene single... meaning we were drunk so the judgment may have been slightly impaired.  I needed to include this spot because not only did I want to try this place sober, I wanted my friends' opinions on the joint.  Plus they serve beer... and we were damn thirsty. Parking is always good.  We could have rolled up to get tacos from their truck in the parking lot but we wanted beer so inside we went.  This was a mistake.  This Saturday afternoon, it was damn hot.  And the wait was too damn long.  This was an exercise in business inefficiency - 10 people working in the kitchen... one cashier who also handled drinks, 3 workers just standing in the corner watching, other's working their asses off in the sweltering heat, no one to help serve beer (which is done at the counter furthest from the front door).... result, 15 minute wait to order, another 20 minutes to get our pitcher of beer which we were able to get 5 minutes after getting our tacos.  Not to mention that we were dripping in sweat while waiting since there seemed to be no a/c.  I don't know if all this led to my disappointment in the tacos but all of us agreed... nothing special.  It was still better than King Taco even though we all noticed all the similarities between the places.  I never confirmed it but I heard that this joint was owned by someone in the same family, etc.  Nevertheless, this place tasted like the mom-and-pop version of what the King Taco chain was based on... al pastor was moister and the tortilla was better than King Taco.  Unfortunately, I don't know if I will ever be back... especially since I no longer frequent the k-town night scene as I once did as a youngster... thank God.

Some of the most authentic Mexican food in Los Angeles.  Never a let down.  Best carne asada, sopes, tortas, and tacos.  Steer clear of the nachos though, unless you like that fake nacho cheese.  Environment ranges from nurses/doctors to local families.  Always delicious and fresh.

I remember taurino being the best tacos in LA but now they are equivalent to taco bell, which is garbage.  The tacos are small, expensive and overrated. The line was long and only one cashier was open. To top it off i took a burrito to go which ended up being the size of a skinny tamale. Horrible. try it for yourself see what you think.

So far this is one of the best places to eat REAL Mexican food. The food is delicious but caution you will leave with few extra pounds under your belt!

El Taurino used to be the best place to go, but things in El Taurino has changed a lot! I understand how the prices went up due to the economy, but the proportions didn't as well. I got a burrito the other day and literally thought it was just a bigger taco. My Sope barely had any cheese on it... I used to love this place, but I'm just not too sure any more. I usually go late at night 10-12pm-ish and they never have any red hot sauce! It could just be timing and the burrito-bartista that's making my order but lately I've been getting disappointed every time i stop by.

sorry, i think grand central's tomas still has the best tacos and carnitas michoacan still has the best burritos and nachos. but  maybe i'm biased... but i feel pretty right on this. the confusing, long lines, body heat and smell...just wasn't worth it for me in the end...oh yea, not to mention their stingy hot sauce rationing!! but being as crazy popular as it is, it's something you've gotta try at least once i guess. (you should know, i didn't try their burrito...friends ordered the burritos which looked just alright, but maybe that would make the difference? i had their tacos and nachos...just bien, not muy!)

I went to El Taurino for the first time that place was horrible tasteless. Long lines not worth the wait disgusting, people in downtown don't know what their talking about. King taco is still king. El Tepeyac in east LA are the only games in town.

My mom and aunt use to always buy me, my brother and cousins burritos from this place because it is close to where they work. So at least once a week, usually on fridays, after they got off of work they would pick us up from our grandparents house and we had these bad boys waiting for us. I have so many fond memories of burritos and horchatas from here and although I have never actually been physically inside this restaurant, I can testify that the burritos here are the best i have ever had. Thanks mom!

buritos are great only they got smaller. the place has a matador theme, so you'll see bull heads on the walls with pics of bullfighters.  it's a pretty good mexican spot that's open well after midnight.

El Taurino has been a staple in our family since I was a child. Prices have changed, so has overall quality, but in the end, nobody beats Tacos Al Pastor nor de Asada in LA, nobody! I usually head over late night after a night of clubbing in DTLA. Always crowded, but it's for a reason. The authentic tacos and burritos are what has made el Taurino a household name in LA, and even for those that are from out of town. You can't go wrong with a carne asada burrito and an agua de horchata to wash it down with. The carne asada burrito I usually get costs around $5 only because I ask for an asada burrito with meat-only, no beans, no rice, nothing except meat and onion/cilantro. Try it, you'll be glad you did.

So I came here, finally, with some school mates after much rave and debate whether to go here or to King Taco for a quick bite near campus. The place ain't more than of hole in the wall decked out in a tauromachy theme/decor which was cool, though a bit tacky. I was surprised and perplexed when i read the menus, since I thought we'd chosen El Taurino, over King Taco...yet the menus were suspiciously similar, aesthetically and almost identical offerings...And the taste you may ask...non surprisingly about the same. Don't get me wrong, the tacos and sopes are good, yet uninspiring. Nothing special here; at least nothing i can't get in nearly half of all the other restaurants and King Taco's around town. Unless you're in a crunch for time, or just happen to be starving and in the immediate vicinity, I'd skip this place all together. Follow other yelpers, a.nd now my advise too...go chase a taco truck, or go to La Loteria instead.

As everyone else, I stop by this place late at night. Usually it's filled with Mexicans and Koreans. The carne asada tacos are the best. Great marination and HOT sauce. I gave the place only for stars because the wait is too long. It's like going to the DMV. Try the horchata.

My first experience at El Taurino was on Halloween night around 1 am. The line was long-- but it was worth the wait.  I had the carne asada tacos which were delicious and really spicy (the way i like it). I've come back a bunch of times afterwards and the only thing preventing it from getting 5 stars is its inconsistency and slightly powdery horchata.  I came here on Cinco de Mayo for the al pastor tacos and horchata and it was just okay.  I meat didn't seem fresh and wasn't as spicy.  The horchata wasn't fully mixed since I got a shock of powder at the end of my drink.  But I do love their chicken tamales.  Warning: they call out the numbers in spanish so be alert.

Did I order the wrong thing? I got a combo burrito with beef suadero and a carne asada taco. Where did I go wrong?! My roommate and I both went to college in San Diego (best tacos ever) and are originally from the Bay Area (where awesome burritos reside) so when we read on yelp that El Taurino had the best, we expected something that came close to our standards. This was seriously one of the biggest disappointments from yelp - mostly because the burritos were definitely below average. First of all, the tortilla wasn't even heated. It tasted powdery and the texture was terrible. The fillings of the burrito were okay but they need to add about 2x more into the burrito. The proportion of flour tortilla to the actual contents of the burrito was terrible. All I could get was tortilla.  Also, I wasn't even full after I finished off the burrito.  Usually, I can never finish an entire burrito in one sitting.  Even at Chipotle, I can only get about half so I was very surprised that I could still eat more after finishing up the burrito.  The taco was average at best, carne asada was way too chewy.  On the other hand, the al pastor sope the roommate got wasn't bad.  Too bad I didn't get myself one of those. I might give this place another try some time in the future but I'm not sure yet since I don't think it's worth returning to.  However, I have to give some stars to El Taurino for being pretty spacious and clean for a Mexican taco/burrito joint and having a big parking lot.  I was a little hesitant when I read the review about the cockroaches but El Taurino exceeded my expectations in terms of cleanliness.

This place IS good, but it's definitely overhyped AND overpriced. The only reason why this place has such great carne asada is because every other mexican restaurant buys crappy beef, it's usually pretty old, and they usually try to hide it by drenching it in lemon. Besides their tender carne asada, I don't see why this place is "soooo good". The reason why their carne asada is so good is because it is better quality beef, and it shows in the price compared to portion. The taco was literally three bites. Now, don't get me wrong.. It was indeed yummy. I also tried their nachos, and it was literally chips, nacho cheese and carne asada. Really? I prefer real, melty cheese on nachos... Has anyone ever had Super Nachos before? I can't even count what's on it! Plus, how hard is it to throw some onions and cilantro in it? The curiosity was killing me.. why does everyone and their grandma swear by this taco joint? I ordered a al pastor taco. That taco made me believe that this restaurant has got some serious beef with LA because it wants to char up every citizen of Los Angeles' intestines. I can't even say that just the pork was spicy, but they also drenched it with red hot sauce! It was alright, but soooo friggin spicy. My lips were seriously numbing. I'm STILL not satisfied with what I've tried.. so I had to get something else. I got a chicken burrito with rice, beans, onions, cilantro... it was mediocre.. I give up. The only thing worth getting is the carne asada taco, and it's expensive in comparison to other joints. Oh yeah, and no soda re-fills? WTF? I would even understand if they had 50 cent refills, but it was a WHOLE $2.50 for a refill? Do I ENJOY getting robbed?? Do I WANT you to backhand me across the face and thank you for it? No. I would come back if I'm around the area.. but I wouldn't go out of my way for it, and I wouldn't get anything other than carne asada taco or burrito. And I'll bring my own $1 soda from 7-11, thank you.

LATE NIGHT DRUNKEN MUNCHIES. I love carne asada anything. Love the steak torta with avocados.  I'll eat about 4 carne asada tacos covered in onions and cilantro and drenched in red sauce with a dash of Tapatio and then soaked in lime juice.  Worth they wait--yes, well worth other people's wait..I usually luck out with having it brought over to me.

First off great carne asade tacos. However, the wait is terrible, it took me close to 40 minutes to get 6 tacos and they are quite stingy with the salsa. Also the smell of the place is really powerful, don't be surprised if you smell like the restaurant after you leave. Overall, great food but mediocre service.

So I usually rate King Taco as my favorite taco spot, but I forgot about El Taurino. Iv'e only been here once but it was a good experience. It did remind me A LOT of King Taco. I heard as well that it did have the same owners as King Taco, but one just branched off and started El Taurino. Based on my first experience, I loved it. The meat was really good! The salsas were ok, I liked king taco's better. If it wasn't so far, I would come here on a regular. The area is real sketchy, but if I am in the area I'll definitely make a stop.

This place gets insanely busy at night! I thought that King Taco gets busy, no this place gets crazy busy. This place is such a spot at night that the security is outside focused on traffic control, no joke! Not only can you go inside to order, but they also park their taco truck outside to lighten the load of business inside! I would rank this place up with King Taco, absolutely delicious! No matter what you want to eat here, it is all good! I usually get the carne asada tacos...mmmmm my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Be careful though, their red sauce can make your ears steam! This is a must eat at place!

I love the hot sauce here. It's super spicy and it hurts when you eat it, my mouth is usually on fire by the end of the night. (Which I love) I have yet to find a place that has hot sauce that is as good as it is here (well, I guess there's King Taco, but it's owned by the same people right?). I love the red sauce but the green sauce is really good too...sometimes I mix, sometimes I don't...depending on what I feel like I can handle. I usually pay for it the next day, but it's totally worth it!

i shouldn't even be writing a review on this place.  why? I'M ALWAYS BLACKED OUT WHEN I'M HERE.  i've only made treks here at 3-4 am after a night of clubbing or drinking.  and i'm goneeeeeeee. i've never ordered at the counter myself because that's what my awesome and less-drunk friends are for!  i'm too busy knocked out at the table.  so i don't even know how much all the food is. all i've tried here are the SOPES!  i might not remember much about anything at el taurino but i can tell you that the sopes are delicious.  the crunchy bottom shell atop with grilled cubes of beef and cotija cheese (amazing that i remember this huh?).  and what makes it more amazing is the famous red sauce.  i never realized how spicy the sauce was since apparently, my taste buds go dead when i'm drunk.  but the morning after, the surface of my tongue starts peeling off.  yea, gross, i know.  i must've taken shots of the red sauce for that to happen... my guy friends rave about the all-meat burrito.  it's astonishing how fast guys can finish a huge burrito in a matter of minutes.  there was this one time when one guy finished it so fast, he asked for another one, not realizing that he just devoured one (yes, he was blacked out). i used to come here at least once or twice a week but the long lines and wait forced me to search for late-night food elsewhere (yay for ghetto dogs on sidewalks!). tons of people come here after 2 am.  you look at some of them pondering, "didn't i see those guys at the club?  ...huh, so that's what they really look like in the light..."

After two visits and countless bites from people's late night cravings, I'm still not sure what all the fuss is about. Maybe because my taste buds are not accustomed to the west coast Mexican food (which I realize IS the Mexican food), but there's a lot of other types of food that will come up to mind when I'm drunk and in need of nourishment.

I had high expectations for El Taurino after hearing how great it was, but I found it to be just mediocre. I should have known better since I've been to King Taco, its sister restaurants. Just like King Taco, the carne asada here is frozen, pre-cut and comesin clear plastic bags. They just cut open the bags and throw the meat on the grill. My guess is that El Taurino and all the King Tacos get their prepackaged meat from a central processing facility. That's great for consistency across locations, but not great when it comes to freshness or flavor. The al pastor I saw cooking on the trompo was okay, but nothing spectacular I'd go out of my way for. I much prefer La Taquiza's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…). The hot sauce, which people rave about , was just okay and whomever thinks their hot sauce is spicy must have a low tolerance level. I see no difference between El Taurino and King Taco except for the name. It appears that a lot of the positive reviews for El Taurino come from late-night K-town partiers and those that have been doing heavy drinking. The ordering system there is disorganized and confusing. I didn't know which window was available and the people taking orders weren't very attentive. The mid-afternoon wait for my order of four tacos also seemed a little long. I'm glad I didn't go when they were busy.

Best Tacos EVER! I've been coming to El Taurino since I was a little girl and I have to agree, long lines and it's gotten A LOT more expensive. You can't beat the horchata though it's the bomb!! The sopes, the burritos, the tacos, the tortas, yum everything there is so yummy. The meat is infused w/lime and tastes even better with the salsa. Tip for everyone, phone your order in then you don't have to wait in line, your food will be ready at the register. I've got them programmed on my phone.

OH El Taurino how I love thee! I'm horrible bc I always get the same thing! But then again, if it ain't broken why fix it, right? I always get the Carne Assada Burrito. I live for that! It's like crack! OMG I do want to try their other stuff though bc everything looks and smells delicious! Just a warning: For those of you who do not like SPICY remember to ask for the sauce on the side or else you will cry after taking a bite off your burrito! The sauce is good but pretty spicy even for my standards so i dunno. I like how this place attracts a very eclectic crowd. you see the Mexican families enjoying a nice meal together, the business ppl grabbing a bite to eat after a long day at work, and the fobby krns with their high heels and LV purses with their equally fobby bfs with their Ed Hardy hats and True Religion Jeans hahaha That can only mean ONE thing... this place is good! I have yet to sit there and order a pitcher but that is definitely a bonus for this place as well! Only reason I wont give it 5 stars its bc it takes FOREVER for the food to be ready, the burritos are smaller then what I would like them to be and the place is ghetto and smelly. Other than that, El taurino is 24 hrs great drunk food OR sober food and makes me happy :)

i do think this place is a little overrated...or maybe i just came with high expectations? maybe i got the wrong thing? this place looks pretty legit, and definitely not as ghetto as other mexican food places i've been to. it was really crowded, which was a good sign, considering there's so many other similar places in the area. $1.25/taco..not bad, pretty reasonable. i got 2 carne asada tacos, and i wasn't too thrilled with it. carne asada is my fave meat when i go  to mexican places...but the carne asada here was sooo dry..maybe it was an off day? my friend told me i got the wrong meat and should've gotten something else.. =( my bf got sopes here and i've only gotten sopes in san diego at this place famous for them, so it's the only place i have to compare it to ---and this does not hold a candle to the other place..the fried tortilla thing on the bottom tasted stale.. how did we get through this meal? with everything drenched in the spicy, delicious hot sauce, followed by many gulps of horchata to relieve the burningggggg! man, when everyone said the sauce was spicy, i thought they were just wimps that couldn't handle spicy..i was wrong...pretty spicy..lol BUT GOOD!

Fantastic food, get the giant steak thing that is bigger than the tray and dripping with lard. The hot sauce is very spicy and takes you by surprise because it's served chilled.

I will give them 3 stars because I have to admit their burritos are good.   Also, cleaness of their kitchen.  But don't even bother yourself to get a good or nice customer service if you are not Hispanic decent.  They will charge you literally with everything.  Extra for more onion, sauce, etc... But when I went there with my Hispanic friend, they didn't charge a penny more for extra thing she'd asked for. They should be more clear on extra condiment policy.

if i was for whatever reason jailed, sent to the gallows, had 24 hours left to live, or was just looking for some good tacos, el taurino would definitely be one of my top must-have before "fill the the blank" foods. carnitas, carne asadas, their toxic orange red hot sauce... they take my breath away. ^ ^ not to mention giving me some kickin' breath, what with all those raw onions and cilantro (i am NOT a raw onions fan - see review of Versailles) my stomach goes through hell the next day, but what the hell, they're too tasty to pass up. i'm totally a fan. i'm just a bit mad about the fact that they don't give FREE hot sauce, like king taco does. c'mon now - spread the spicy goodness 'round!

There's not a lot of places where you can get good meat... hot fresh cooked meat, and this is one of those places, but every time I go there, I have premonitions of being lanced in the flank as some of the bulls were being lanced in the pictures in el taurino.. but meh...

Not bad, not bad at all.  I come here randomly for lunch when I am at school...that being said, be prepared for a wait if you are coming during lunch time.  And really, you can't go wrong with the carne asada or the al pastor tacos but really when I come to these taco shops I rather get sopes.  For those of you that don't know what they are (like me) its pretty much a fried version of the taco with refried beans, cheese, and lettuce.  And finally, as other say, this place's red and green hot sauce are pretty bomb.

I used to come here for the tacos from the truck outside. Now I come strictly for the costillas rancheras. These are the illest. Beef ribs served hot and greasy.  I actually got these on accident the 1st time but can't order anything else now. They also have barbacoa estilo Texcoco on Sundays. This is some steamed lamb cheeks or something and is pretty interesting. If you're lucky you might get to see them crack a lamb head in half with a machete.

I went here after reading the Yelp reviews.  I wanted to try the al pastor meat from the spit.  I had several tacos of all types, a sope, and a chicken tamale.  I was underwhelmed.  I've had better tacos al pastor not from a spit at places in Los Angeles like El Super Taco.  It didn't come close to my gold standard for tacos al pastor, at one of the many places on Avenida Nueva Inglaterra in Cuernavaca, Mexico.  They serve them with a bit of avacado and pineapple in Morelos.  Anyway, this place was just OK.  I won't be back.  I went to taco Zone later in the night and got a suadero quesadilla, which quenched my appetite for good Mexican food that persisted after stopping at this place.  Maybe the tortas are better.

Not a lot of people know that this place is definitely the same as the King Taco chain. For proof, order a tamale and you will see the King Taco Corporation wrapper. The food is always consistent and delicious here, but there is nothing unique or special about their food. The 5th star is awarded to restaurants that bring something extra special.

I've been a patron of El Taurino for 14-15 years now and things have hardly changed since my first visit. The food is cheap and taste perfect every time. The salsa rojo is my personal favorite, but be careful it packs a punch. Especially the next day if you catch my drift. They have an assortment of meats and fixing's you can pick from. But you can never go wrong with the carne asada tacos and all meat burritos with a side of crema. They're open late and perfect for the midnight munchies, just be aware that you'll waiting in line like you do at Pink's. El Taurino is the same company as King Taco but the food, sauce and menu is slightly different. El Taurino definitely has a better larger menu.

This place is pretty much like King Taco except not as good. They seem to skimp on the meat here too. I think it's overpriced here and I've had plenty better for Mexican food. I probably won't be eating here again. I had the Al Pastor tacos, Carne Asada tacos, and Meat/Queso nachos.

This place makes excellent mexican food! Their al pastor tacos are actually cooked on a spit just like you usually see it south of the border. The carne asada plate is really good too!

I have been hearing endless hype about King Taco from my friends who know more about LA than I do, and was craving a great carne asada burrito tonight. Unfortunately King Taco and I have differing circadian rhythms, so my friend recommended El Taurino since they are managed by the same people, essentially the same, etc... I guess I have been spoiled by taco trucks, and this local cantina back in the OC called Los Primos. The taco trucks in LA are awesome, and appear to have pretty quality meat, and tons of free salsa, and sides, for FREE. Ditto for my gold standard place, Los Primos, all the amazing salsa you could ever want, for free. I am doubly spoiled by Los Primos though because for just under $9 they make a burrito that weighs over 2 lbs called The Mr. Serious. It is a behemoth of a burrito that is stuffed with the best carne asada I have ever had anywhere, and rice, beans, salsa, sour cream, all the goodies that go into a truly superb burrito, and it is so large two people can split it, and fail to finish it, and I mean people who eat a lot. By the time you get done properly "accessorizing" your burrito at El Taurino you are pretty close to $8, and the burrito is about 1/10th the size of The Mr. Serious; meanwhile, the ingredients, while perhaps a bit better than what you find at the local taco trucks, are not really close to what I get at Los Primos. Someone commented that this place is better than the other OC late night options like Alerto's and Alejandro's. That's somewhat true, as this is much more authentic, and somewhat healthier (read: lacking in copious quantities of grease). However, those places have great salsas, and they don't charge for them (even for extra!). Plus, there is almost no competition in OC. In LA I would have expected a place with such a reputation to deliver more of a punch, not simply be slightly better than the taco truck a few blocks away (literally, there is a taco truck by the mobil station a few blocks down on Hoover with the best pastor tacos, and gallons of the most delicious salsa for free!!). Finally, what I had heard most was that this place had THE salsa. Well, it is not really THE salsa. The salsa is pretty tasty, though it definitely requires crema for my palette, not because it is too spicy (I had heard it was beyond spicy, but it tastes fairly mild to me, nothing even close to Chichen Itza's salsas), but just because this style of salsa needs crema to compliment it in my opinion, besides which, a truly great carne asada burrito just sparkles with crema. I will say this, the red salsa, which is really more of a hot sauce, is tasty, especially with the crema combination. If they gave you unlimited salsa, or at least a decent helping for free with your burrito, and had a reasonably priced crema option, I would have probably given it at least four stars. But honestly, the sauce tastes like a high-end taco bell mild hot sauce. I mean that in the best way, but that is what it tastes like, and you could get 4 burritos and free sauce at taco bell, and it isn't clear that you would be that much worse off. I guess if you need mexican after 3 am this is definitely your place though (which I frequently do, so who knows, I'll probably be back). I may go back and try the barbacoa, which another reviewer recommended as the specialty. Perhaps that is what is keeping this place in such high esteem. To summarize for those who stick to the bullets: - Over-priced (unless you like your mexican food sans-condiments). - High-end taco bell hot sauce. - Doesn't live up the hype. - Fairly small portions. - But, tastes pretty good overall, and is the only place to get a burrito after 2-3 am in LA. - Also, the barbacoa may be the true specialty.

if you're from LA and u don't know about this BOMB mexican spot, then you aint eating right. most people compare this place to king taco (which i think is also really good) but el taurinos is HANDS DOWN YUMMY! i always get their carne asada burrito with no frijoles and add cheese in it. it always comes out fresh and warm, the cheese is all melted, orgasm in your mouth. 2 bad things are they don't give out cups of waters but only sell water bottles and the burritos are a little small. despite those two probs its still the best spot for mexican food in LA.

Ehhh...really guys? I ordered a carnitas combo burrito and it was pretty disappointingly lacking in size. Not much filling, and the meat had that oldish oily taste. Only redeeming factor was the salsa verde, which was pretty bomb. Otherwise, sorry, don't see what the fuss is all about here, have had much better elsewhere.

I've been loyal to El Taurino for some time but recently, it just hasn't been as good as it used to be for me. Quality is definitely going down, most likely because there is a huge crowd all the time and they just want to feed everyone faster. I feel like I've also found many better alternatives to their tacos and burritos elsewhere. Tostadas are still the best here though. And their red sauce wins... if they lost the red sauce, it'd be over.

The food is awesome. Obviously going to be cheap. there's a roach coach outside of the restaurant to saturate some of the traffic. Parking can be a bitch and the cholos definitely make the restaurant look degrading. Security is decent. If you like spicy, then El Taurino is the SPOT. their hot sauce is friggin aye man..... Good Lord. El Taurino is conveniently located 5 minutes or so east of koreatown and about a 10-15 minute drive SE from hollywood. Opens quite late so when going under the influence of alchohol, i believe enhances the experience becuz ya won't eat this place when ur sober. Ya have a hard time walking in. Service sucks ass if you don't speak Espanol~!!!

One word: danksauce. El Taurino has yet to fail me and I've never been there under the influence of anything. Their tacos hit the spot and always get the sauce on the side if you're not a fan of spicy. I'm especially a fan of their sopes, extra crunchy goodness. Don't forget to ask for the green sauce and they don't provide water like regular restaurants so just order a horchata while you're at it. And if you want to be a true LA-er and live it up, take the food togo and eat on the trunk of your car. pure danksauce.

I decided to put all my eggs in one basket and ordered five tacos al pastor. Tacos were definitely authentic and tasty. Ask for taco sauce.

i've been going here since 2000 and they're still as good as they were when i chomped into that first, fateful carne asada taco. if you're lucky, there will be less than 3 people in line when you walk in.  i stick to the standards: carne asada, al pastor, carnitas.  taco, burrito.  their salsa verde is limey and good.  their salsa roja cannot be compared to any other red sauce i've ever had anywhere, period.  it rates a 9 out of 10 on my spicy scale, but still manages to keep a good, saucy consistency and is very flavorful too!  if you are weak sauce, all of the crushed ice that accompanied your horchata inside your cup may not be enough to put out that small scale chemical fire in your mouth.  you may have to go through a small stack of napkins wiping away the sweat that beads up on your brow, but this place is one of the most satisfying mexican dining experiences i am lucky enough to enjoy once in a while. preparation of your order may take a while, but it is oh so worth it.

Maybe I didn't hop on the bandwagon for this place in time to fully enjoy it. Or maybe I just didn't try anything worthy enough to make an opinion. But after late night dinner, my friend was still hungry & I didn't drive so I was forced to tag along. I just ordered an horchata, but was thoroughly displeased. Each sip left a chalky residue on my tongue making it feel like sandpaper. YUCK. I don't know why it was like that, but I'm used to the horchata from local taco trucks and those go down a lot smoother. Had to trash the horchata @ the end when I usually suck it dry. Yes, suck it dry. The asada in my friend's taco seemed kinda chewy, and I swear they cheat you on the sauce. However, I'm willing to come back and order something else. But only if I'm in the area... til then, I will stick to my trucks.

We came here after checking out Seven Grand, Golden Gopher, and Library Bar.  Not that great food even after having some drinks in me.  There were a lot of club kids here at 2 in the morning.  We ordered the Special Carnitas Plate and Carnitas Torta.  The carnitas looked and tasted like it had been cooked, stored in the fridge, and then re-heated.  Friends ordered the nachos, which looked disgusting.  The cheese came out of a dispenser that wasn't very appealing.  The order pick up is chaotic here.  I'd only recommend the tacos or tostadas at the very least.  The burritos looked decent.  I wouldn't recommend this place - I've had better Mexican food in the SF Valley.

What can I say that hasn't been said? What can I inform, that hasnt already been raved about? I'll say this: El Taurino is your basic Mexican food, you know burritos/tacos/tortas, etc, etc... but done oh' so very very perfect! Just the way you would want you it. The chilli is unique and adds to the tastiness. The location is a cool spot, and the atmosphere is lively, matter of fact last time I was there, they had a clown passing out balloon animals (is that lively enough for ya). So if your in town and want the best of the basics, get your butts on over.

I went to el taurino to grab a late night snack. I ordered a carne asada burrito. As I was eating it, a bug drops on my plate. I went up to the workers and told them that a bug fell out of my burrito. They called the manager over and he said he'll give me more onions. Say what?! Onions? why on earth would I want more onions. I asked him to make me a new burrito and guess what? He said NO! I was like you stingy lil @#$%^&*(. No matter how good the food is, I would never go back cause the customer service is HELL.

i'll pop my yelp review cherry w/ this joint, which used to be my favorite restaurant ever.  the ET tostada is still my favorite thing to eat on earth. their hot sauce still sizzles the tongue.  horchata still hella good.   BUT man how the mighty has fallen.  inflated prices coupled with deflated fixings makes for a bad pairing.  i have a strong dislike for restaurants that are sheisty, and everything on the menu has decreased drastically in size.   the "combo" burrito is a misnomer - hardly any meat and mostly rice and beans.  the combo burrito looks more like a flauta now.   the tortillas on the tacos are inconsistent too, sometimes cooked just right while other times hard from being undercooked.  depending on who your 'burrito technician' is, even the tostada is flawed.  not enough refried bean paste on the shell, barely a sprinkle of meat, and a sheist-fest with the onions, tomato, and avocado.   3 years ago, i would've given the place a 5-star rating,  even w/ the ridiculous lines.  but no more.  when done right, the food can still be good.  so i recommend going pre-lunch, pre-dinner, or before the post-clubbing crowd arrives.  stick with the tostada, torta, all-beef burritos, and horchata.  i would avoid the non-carne asada meats, the combo burrito, and the tamales.

An hour after returning on a trip from Ensenada, we really wanted to compare tacos. I think that my standards are set too high now, not sure if I'll find a place that will ever satisfy my taste buds. This place has pretty good nachos minus the nasty spicy guacamole, carne asadas are just ok. I won't be rushing back or anything. Not really worth a trip to the ghetto.

The food has it's ups and downs. Surprisingly, the most recent time I went in there was no line. Maybe it's because it's not as good as it use to be. I remember back in the day before the economy problems this place use to be off the chain! The staff was friendly, the food cooked right, it was full of flavor and everyone was happy. Now the food is ok, my friends force me to come here haha because it's on the way home. The only real reason why I would decide to come here vs. my local taco shop is because of the salsa. That stuff still tastes really good :) but they are very stingy with it so enjoy it responsibly.

Normally my friends and I go to Michaocan's after clubbing. But we decided to go here because my sister and her friend's wanted it. This place is bigger and WAY more packed. The nachos are different from Michaocan's in that they aren't drenched in nacho sauce. I like both. The tacos here are also good but pretty spicy. I like that there is more seating but be warned with so many people they have to serve your food will take a while.

i love love love carne asada tacos and burritos here!! its perfect for a late night bite after drinking/clubbing/partying whatnot..it seriously hits the spot. i always get like 4 carne asada tacos or a carne asada burrito hold the frijoles. the red sauce is seriously...so HOT and addicting..when i think i cant handle anymore of the incredible spice, i catch myself pouring more onto my tacos! and i like to buy extra sauce and take it home to pour all over other foods~ hehe. the only reason i gave this place one less is because whenever i go, theres a ridiculous wait, but then i have gone during peak times...but seriuosly...last time i went at 2am, and i i think i waited about an hour for my food.... anyhow i love it!

The food was good and very no frills and authentic. I had the carne asada burrito, which I sorta wished was bigger, but it was tasty nonetheless. Tried some of the nachos, which were also good, and the tamales, which didn't have enough meat in them. Go easy with the red suace, which is SUPER spicy!

3.5 stars ordered the carne asada, al pastor, carnitas, and lengua tacos $1.25/ea took forever and this was not afterhours, when it's traditionally crowded the chaotic system doesn't help any maybe it's best to go the truck outside the restaurant overall it's good, but the problem was, the various meat was so spicy, I couldn't easily tell the difference among them horchata -- extra on the cinnamon

El Taurino is a carbon copy of King Taco.  I don't know which establishment came first, but I first started to frequent King Taco before El Taurino so I have to give King Taco a slightly better review as it first introduced me to quality authentic Mexican food.  The one benefit El Taurino has over King Taco is that it is open much later than King Taco although at times it creates chaos as it does get insanely busy at night as mentioned by Ricky.  You have to really stay on top of your order when they are calling it out usually in Spanish or you may be waiting around for a long time.   On one occasion my friend didn't hear his order called and when he went to ask, the server stated that he called his order about 5-10 minutes ago.  It can be a little hard to hear when it's busy as they can be calling out multiple orders at once and you have the noise of the crowd.  I haven't disliked anything I have ordered whether it be the sope, burritos, nachos, or tacos.  It tastes the same as King Taco so everything tastes pretty good.  The prices are either the same or comparable too.  The red salsa is the hotter of the two sauces and they will ask you what items you want on your burrito.  I asked for everything on my burrito yesterday and when I got my order I asked for some salsa to which the food preparer said that it is in my burrito so I didn't need additional salsa and did not give me any.  She was right as they had placed the red salsa in my burrito and it was pretty spicy.  Next time I'll ask to withhold the salsa and just get it on the side.   I prefer to go to King Taco as it's not as busy probably because they so many locations, and most of the King Taco's are larger than El Taurino, but if it's late at night then off to El Taurino and wait through the long crowd.

I love this place! So weak about  it. The red sauce is awesome...it's so good that it burns, but only in a good way. I usually have something with Lengua or Cabeza. EVERYTHING is good! It's not a fancy schamancy place with waiters. All food is served on disposal "dinnerware". Also, the horchata is like no other. Do not go with people who are into the Westside or Weho bistros, unless they are open to hole-in-a-walls. Sober or drunk...this place is awesome!

I'm reviewing the taco truck...not the restaurant. The reason for the 2 stars is that they don't have a salsa or condiment bar...so you can't add all the onions/cilantro and slather all the salsa that you want. Boo on you.

Tacos, tortas, burritos, Costillas de ranchera, barbacoa... 23 years later (for me) and it hasnt changed... well maybe except for the size of the burritos and the price. If you go on Sat and Sun they have Chicarrones for sale, you can buy extra salsa rojo al lado (on the side/beside) and take home some piggy for piggy.

My friend gave up meat for Lent. At the stroke of 12 after midnight Easter mass, my brother and I met up with him at El Taurino. He then proceeded to annihilate a tongue burrito, four carne asada tacos, and a carne asada tostada. El Taurino is that good. The carne asada tacos at El Taurino are bomb. It's a light spread of beans on the tostada, topped with a mound of carne asada, onions and cilantro, Mexican cheese, and grilled onions. IT'S SO GOOD. I can eat their tostadas for days. El Taurino offers a variety of different meats with their dishes. My brother especially likes the beef tongue. Most other joints boil their beef tongue, but El Taurino grills theirs which gives it a lot more flavor and keeps the meat from being too chewy. Their all tongue burrito is really good. The al pastor is equally as good. You can get it with any of their items and that shit will melt in your mouth. I am also a fan of their tamales. I had their mole tamale during the Christmas season and it was seriously one of the best tamales I've ever had. Don't be put off by the hoards of people lining up to order. It gets especially crowded late at night because people come in for their drunken late night snack. You actually encounter a wide mix of Mexican and Korean people enjoying the same great food. Two different ethnic groups from two different continents enjoying the same food really says something about El Taurino.

So truth be told like some others, the first time I was brought to El Taurino (after late night drinking) I was very apprehensive and waited in the car for my bf to go get the food. Granted it was my 3rd time visiting LA and given the location and not being familiar with seeing bars on windows or door height markers on restaurant doorways, this place seemed a bit "hood". The bf came back with a burrito, three carne asada tacos and a horchata and i didnt want to try it as I was worried about the cleanliness.  Thankfully i have no will power when it comes to not eating and after a few minutes I gave in and boy am I glad i did. I ended up finishing more than he expected and had to go back in myself to get more.

Carne asada tacos. $1.25 plus tax (which is getting kind of expensive in LA county, don't you think?). DELICIOUS. Their red hot sauce is so hot it makes my face flush red, my eyes water, and my nose run. But oh so delicious. Their tacos are small and simple: two corn tortillas, meat, onion, cilantro. And the deliciousness factor. Oh, how I want one.. or five.. right now. And they do take credit cards with no minimum purchase order. I have (shamefully) charged two tacos before no problem.

One of my top 5 restaurants.  Been eating/craving El taurino for about a decade now.  I'm in OC, so it's a real treat whenever I go to LA and have El taurino. I love their al pastor tortas, carne asada burritos, carne asada tostadas, lengua tacos and LOOOOOOOOVE their intense hot sauce.  That stuff is so rich and strong, just how I like it. It really burns going down... but it's not just BURN that I like about this sauce... it has this amazing, savory flavor too!  Anyway, I big warning to anyone trying El taurino for the first time... be prepared to frequent the "restroom" afterwards.  eek!

omg el taurino......... once you have tried el taurino, you will get hooked!! especially the hot red sauceeeee. i wish they sold the sauce separately because i would totally buy it. i'm a torta lover. i only get torta when i come to el taurino and my friends would scold me because i'm not enjoying the true mexican food that they're offering such as tostadas or tacos. whatever! i still get torta because it just melts in my mouth. the avacado.. the melted cheese.. the carne asada meat.. the tomato... (i take off onions&beans cuz i hate them) oh yummmm. i'm pretty good at handling spicy food and let me tell you, the red sauce burns. my lips turn super red but that sauce is seriously addicting. i use the whole thing (sometimes i feel like i eat the food just to finish the sauce....) my mouth is watering as i'm typing this at 3:20am. sigh EL TAURINO FTW

oh El Taurino... in all the years that I have been frequenting your establishment... so disappointing every time I go (as of late), thinking it will be better... and yet, I still keep coming back to you. your prices have increased, the size and quantity and quality of your food items have decreased. and a mini battle seems to be waging in my GI tract from our last encounter. i am saddened on this day. such high hopes were crushed and sent to pray to the porcelain gods instead.

my place to go for late night tacos after drinking in LA. i can't believe i never wrote a review for this place. what i eat: - tacos! usually asada and al pastor, these lil two biters are perfect mix of meat, oil, onions, cilantro and hot sauce. TIP: ask for the red sauce on the SIDE. their roja sauce is dangerous! you want to control how much you put on. their green sauce is also very good - nachos con carne: they use the gooey nacho sauce. normally i hate that stuff and avoid it, but i dont mind it here. TIP: ask for onions and cilantro on top pros: - parking lot! i've never had trouble finding a spot, whether it's late night or dinner time. in LA free parking lots are a blessing! - FOOD: this is the greasy, stick to your ribs, coat your alcohol drenched stomach kind of mexican food. - BEER: they only have 3 beers on tap, but god bless them for even have beers! i always get amber bock - price: okay, so i've had tacos for cheaper at a truck, but el taurinos has a dining area where you can sit and enjoy your food instead of shivering and drunkenly swaying out on the street. so, i dont mind paying the extra few cents for a place to sit down. i can walk away gut busting FULL with about $10. - TIP: for all the late night weekenders, try getting your food at the truck! fri/sat nights they usually have a taco truck in the parking lot. usually the lines are a lot shorter! cons: - busy! they are always busy. in all the times ive been here ive always had to wait in line. smelling all that carne asada while standing in line can be torture, but its worth it! its also a great place to people watch all the ktown clubbers and mexicans that just got off work looking for a bite to eat - table hovering: sometimes when its packed its difficult to find a table. - cleanliness: cause its so busy, its not always the cleanest. your table may have some remnants of the previous eaters meal on it. just suck it up and wipe it off! your tacos want to get in your belly! would i come again? YES i always do! :)

The only things to hate on about this place are the portions and long waits. I thought it just the 2am rush that slowed down the place, but when I came here for lunch I got the same questionable amount of wait time...for 2 tacos. People always try to compare King Taco and El Taurino, but what makes El Taurino better is that they have crack aka tostada. I literally cried when I went into KT and saw no tostada on their menu. Other than that, the red sauce is the same and pretty much changed everything I knew about tacos. Which is kinda sad in a way since I live in the OC and none of the taquerias here are even slightly similar. I literally drove 20 minutes to buy some red sauce to bring back for taco night.

I LOVE this place.  Whenever i have trouble figuring out what to eat for dinner, I seem to want to eat here.  The ironic thing is, I don't really like mexican.  I know some might argue tacos and burritos really isn't mexican but i never really liked either.  I guess the problem is that I've been to mexico and have had real authentic mexican food in juarez, mexicali and along the gulf somewhere and it was just honest and quite tastey.  El taurino really just reminded me of those days in mexico.  Had a good combination of flavors.  Love it!

The food is really good, the only thing is the fuck'd up managers and some of the staff are a bunch of assholes, depends on the time you go when it's not too busy their pretty good with the amount of meat  depending on who makes it, but trust me if you have any complaints to the manager he's just an asshole,I suppose most immigrants are not as good with customer service like the Americans are.

i had a tostada here and it was BOMB. but you know what. when you're drunk and it's 2am, almost anything tastes good. either way, i enjoyed what i got, but i probably would not come here sober to satisfy a mexican food craving. apparently they've gotten cheap with the food and charge you for water too wtf. i have to say though the red and green sauce was SO good. i definitely did not think the red sauce would be as hot as it was so i doused my tostada with it and my lips were red and swollen afterwards. so good!!

love this place.  been here a couple late nites, and each time its great seeing the [albeit relatively segregated] mix of latinos and koreans (love the k-town culture clash) stumbling around in their club gear and heals looking to end their nite [of probable failure at hooking up with a random in the club given their choice of post-bar activity] with delicious mexican food.  it would be a an even nicer twist on k-town if there were spanish speaking koreans cooking in the back, but alas the cook-force is standard los angeles.  a weird yet quite cool experience when you're the sole grubbin whitey.  decor is attractively ethnic with plenty of seating even with the huge lines that form post-bar, and the added awesomeness of a jukebox playing at an appropriate volume (music and friends can all be heard; nice). have had tacos and sopes with buche (alltime fav; if u don't know, don't ask), suadero, carne asada, and carnitas, all of which are 4 stars delectable, and for completeness, seem to be chopped up on the finer side (guessing the lengua is chunkier as is typical).  the tacos are dressed standardly (onions and cilantro) with optional (yet oh so requisite) yummifying fixins of hot as f smoky liquified red sauce and delicious chunkier-than-usual green sauce.  have also had a quesadilla with carne; goes great with the spicy guacamole that comes with.  nachos with carne also delicious with melty nacho cheese; awesome dipped in either sauce, imo esp. the red.  based on other reviews and personal taste--in descending order of awesomesoundingness--i gotta try their torta, tostada, and burrito.  sorry not much of a food review but all them stuffs are solid 4 wins.  as a whole can stand up to some really good taco joints, but those of you with my kind of fat-passion would probably similarly opine that certain spots do particular meats/dishes/sauces really well, and it sounds like i have yet to try many of those items here (sopes and sauces excluded), including the above mentioned and maybe the al pastor.  future fattening could possibly bear another star. added funness: last nite a fight broke out between wut appeared to be a young drunken korean lad and a high school korean tagging/racing/being lame crew with matching faux-gangster outfits.  sadly was not the race war i was hoping to be extra entertained by, but good enough by my standards at this boring age, and thankfully no one got hurt.  mostly consisted of yelling the n word repeatedly; gotta love that high school level of racially insensitive ignorance.  i think the one guy at the joint that really shoulda got offended wisely bounced instantly upon outbreak.  loved how the employees were just kinda goin on as usual, with one of the cooks queuing up more music on the box during the height of the brawl.  can't beat that entertaining milieu, not to mention the scantily clad eye candy taking me back to my southern california college day fantasies. when u see me--and u will--buy me a sope and i'll let u get friendly with the other quasi-white meat, here rare and exotic.

After reading all the great reviews on yelp, I decided to give this place a try for the first time. Me and my friends got there around 11 at night, the wait wasn't too bad, but by the time we got our food, there were huge lines of people behind us. I got a carne asada burrito with everything on it, with green sauce inside. And I asked for the red sauce, the man who prepped my food was really stingy about giving me the red sauce. It's not like I asked for 5 things of red sauce, I just asked for one. Anyways he hands me the red sauce, so we grabbed a seat in the corner to enjoy our first el taurinos. Honestly, it wasn't too bad, but it was as good as I expected it to be. The meat was moist and tender, and they loaded it up in my burrito, but I thought they put too much onion inside my burrito. Also, the red sauce is HOT!! I had mad heartburn through out the entire  night! I would much rather go to street taco trucks to get better tasting burrito, and faster and better service, but that's just me.

Tooorrrrrrrrrtaaaaas! Call it a Mexican hamburger if you want, but these things are to die for at El Taurino especially after a long night out. Throw in an ice cold pina drink and you're on Cloud Nine. Most people come here to hit up the grub-a-licious tacos, but the tortas with loads of guacamole are better. Know what you want on your food before you get to the window rather than looking like a tourist when the cashier asks you. I've been fortunate enough to have come here on multiple occasions, both while sober and not, and I must admit that the quality of food is just as good as my inebriated mental notes say it is. There's always a line to order regardless of what time of day you go, but the trick is knowing how to listen for your number. Occasionally they'll throw you a bone and say the numbers in English, but it's always helpful to know some numbers in Spanish so you're not left standing around the pick-up window trying to identify your food - learning a new language is fun and very useful in this case. Always ask for the hot sauce, even if you know you can't handle it because it's worth trying. If you plan on sitting down to eat, be sure you're comfortable with loud (really, really loud) jukebox music and a distorted speaker calling out numbers every so often (imagine the drive-thru speaker box on full blast). One rule of thumb, cash only. Cheap tacos, moderately priced burritos, and cold beer to hit the spot, but if you ever feel fancy, try getting the big plate. It's the one that's the hardest to pronounce and looks like a hunk of dead animal with some side dishes - crazy delicious. A good date place if you want to show off to your date that you know an awesome "local" place with good eats, assuming he/she hasn't been here before. Warning* If you really don't know how to operate in a restaurant like this, don't attempt on your first date. If you decide to go at night, you can always go shopping outside on the sidewalk for bootlegged DVDs and music. Dinner and a movie anyone?

I don't know what all the hype about this place is about.  It's plain, simple Mexican food served in the middle of the night.  The service is horrible, and the wait can be an hour right after club hours.  I'd only go to this place if it's two in the morning and the brotha's be hungry.  Otherwise, I'd check out some other joints that give better service and you don't have to wait 30 minutes for your tacos.

so i was totally psyched to be back in california and eatin' an awesome burrito--but my excitement quickly soured after waiting nearly 20 minutes on line and waiting 30 minutes for the food (*note, i don't mind waiting for great food) but when i took a bite into my burrito there was NO FLAVOR, it was awful, completely tasteless so i was hugely disappointed especially b/c this place has gotten so many awesome reviews for the burritos:( we also ordered nachos--and here's the disclaimer, you could go down the road to any 7-11 and get the same quality nachos! seriously, im not even joking, these were store-bought corn chips with store bought cheese whiz! i will say the tacos were very good, but the place is inconsistent--the tacos were very good one night and the next the tacos were not good. I bid you farewell el taurino---what we had was not special, and i've moved on to tastier places--goodbye

Over-rated. Compared to the local taco trucks, this place is all hype and filler.  All it got going for them is a ridiculously hot, hot sauce that tastes decent at best.  They put way too much lime juice on their onion cilantro mix makes it taste too citrus-y.  Their tacos are a rip-off for $1.35 and have got to be the smallest tacos I've seen.  If you got no other spot to go to and you're coming out for an after-clubbing grub-out and you're willing to wait in a long line with a bunch of drunk latinos/koreans, then this place is for you.

This is the same company that owns King Taco.  They have a sit down restaurant plus a truck at the location.  I love their roja sauce!  Their asada, al pastor and chicken tacos are good.  While the meat is not the best I have ever had, their salsa alone makes up for it.  If you're in the mood for the nachos pass, just chopped meat with movie style nacho cheese...  Do what I did, buy tacos from your favorite joint and just put their salsa on it..ahhaah..but for reals, a decent taco spot...

I think the place gets 3 stars overall because it's like HEAVEN when you eat it post-going-out around 3am, but try going during the day and it's not exactly the same. Don't get me wrong, the carne asada tostadas are AMAZING in every way! With the red sauce, that burnnnnns on contact.. I went with a group during the day once and it wasn't even packed, maybe a quarter of the place filled but our food took FOREVER!! I mean, we ordered some tacos and tostadas, maybe some nachos but it took over 30 minutes! How does that happen? Maybe it ALWAYS takes this long but we're usually tipsy so it doesn't seem that long... I don't know... Will I be going back? Of course, only for those carne asada tostadas.. I can do 3, but I'm usually fine with two and maybe a taco...

Great place for cheap, delicious food.  It doesn't get any better than the carne asada tacos with the green sauce.  Tortas here are great as well. I usually like my salsa to be as spicy as possible, but the flavors in the red sauce aren't as complex. so I eagerly make the sacrifice. In the never-ending discussion of whether this place is better than King Taco, El Taurino wins by a nose. The wait can be LONG late at night, but it's worth the wait.

I had high expectations because not only is this Mexican food in LA, but it has over 600 positive reviews. So you go in and wait about 30 minutes to order, then it takes another 30 minutes to get your food...ONE HOUR! So much for 'fast food' I have never been here, i ordered two tacos, a tostada and a carne asada burrito which i thought would be enough food for myself and my girlfriend. She ended up not liking any of the food so I ate it all and still was still very hungry. Nothing pisses me off more than going to a restaurant and wasting your time only to be extremely hungry afterwards. Be warned: Portions here are SMALL! If you have nothing to do and want to waste your entire Saturday night for small portions and mediocre food come to el taurino.

If you have tried the Pseudo Healthy Mexican Food with "black beans" instead of refried beans or have been captivated by the all you can "drink" watered down salsa bars.  Do not go here! But I was looking for the stop your arteries, hot sauce craving, mouth watering, fat lady in the corner eating, oral orgasmic, wet dream, Mexican Food.  . . I found it. El Taurino - The beef is good, but if you like Pork their Al Pastor or "marinated pork" is unbelievable.  And their Salsa is so rich, flavorful and deep that they only give you 1 super tiny cup and make you pay 75 cents for another super tiny cup. Horrible~!, for me who typically eats 6 cups from the all you can eat salsa bars. But, even with this Soup Na#$zi like policy, the restaurant is packed with people all day long. . .  I ate there for lunch yesterday, and I had to go back for dinner tonight. . . How do they do it?  El Taurino portions are smaller than a lot of other places, (i.e. get the all carne burrito, because the mixed with beans has almost no meat in it!) - and furthermore, those cheap scapes (or good stingy business men) don't give out napkins very easily, and again, I can't stand their salsa policy, giving you a dirty eye when asking for more as if it were some type of drug.  But maybe it is, because El Taurino is packed and they must be doing something right or I would have NEVER gone back to be abused by their stingy polices, again and again and again. . . . and again.

This place was a 5-star back in the 90's when only the locals & the die-hard taco hunters knew about it. Now that it's become a household LA name, the quality has gone down. Part of me feels that they've tweeked the menu in order to cater a bit more to the nose-in-the-air, trend following 20-30 somethings. I feel it can be a bit overrated now. I will still devour their food if it was placed in front of me though. I miss the Tarurino's of the 90's :-(

Same owners as the King Taco folks! If you look in the back they cook the meat straight out of the K.T. bags. The salsita is the same thing as K.T., meat and torts. Difference is they serve beer and sliced ribs. Thats it, if you are driving past a K.T. to go to Taurino you are just wasting gas.

I had been going to El Taurino for a few years and had enjoyed their food and about 8 months back the prices and taste began to change. I was very disappointed and stopped going. But recently I went on a trip for a few months and missed the MexiCali food. I know a lot of people have been raving about the Kogi truck or the Kalbi truck, but this is the truck that started it all. I didn't want any type of fusion taco. So I went to El Taurino. I don't know if it was the lack of Mexican food, but the taste and texture of the Asada burrito was heavenly. It tasted like it did the first time I had it. The meat was extremely tender and full of flavor. Mixed with the spicy red sauce... I drooling just thinking about it. I think El Taurino is back to my standards of greatness.

An LA classic. Been around a long time and, hopefully, will continue to be around for a very long time. The red hot sauce is rich and thick. It gives a good burn. The carne asada is juicy and tender. Definitely worth it!

One of the first things I did upon arrival in CA was go to El Taurino.  While in college on the east coast, my then-boyfriend talked about this place (he lives in LA), and my other friends from CA did too.  Constantly.   Now, if you've never been to the west coast and you hear west coasters talk about how shitty mexican food is elsewhere, you think they're talking smack.  And an argument ensues.  Let it be on record that they are right.  I used to not believe Him, but I was wrong.  El Taurino was  where I had my first real mexican carne asada burrito.  And that three/four taco plate order after.  Um, what is in that red sauce?!!  For me, spicy is love, and that red sauce was love.   And how come the majority of mexican food joints on the east don't have horchatas?  Good god, this is what's missing on the east coast. Forget anna's tacqueria and bocca's.  They're crap.  Not that I enjoyed their food to begin with.  After visiting CA that spring though, I think the closest I've come to good burritos on the east was at Felipe's located in Harvard Square.  He would strongly disagree. Next stop: La Salsa!

This is one of my fav Mexican joints because it's exactly what Mexican food should be: cheap, spicy and tasty. I've always been a fan of the carne tacos and burritos but lately I've switched over to their special "Castilla Ranchera" I think it's called. Dunno what it means though. I think it means "Castilla Ranch" but who knows. I have to deduct 1 star because there's a creepy clown inflating balloons in the restaurant. I see him in my sleep. Oh and I wish they would call the numbers in English. I'm constantly thinking back to middle school Spanish for my food.

May I say this place serves the BEST tacos in the world? I have fallen love with this place. I find the tacos to be amazing especially with the Green-colored salsa. What makes it better is their Horchata. I honestly have NEVER found a better Horchata than what they serve at El Taurino. Strongly recommended. :)

The food is convenient and great. However, it's become infested with a post-Ktown nightlife clientele and it can get really icky trying to avoid the faces of (many times tipsy) casual acquaintances from your past under the harsh unforgiving lights. It's a lot better in the afternoon when it's not so busy. They're really anal about the pricing of additional toppings like onions and cilantro, which is a turn-off. Their nachos are flimsy little nacho chips with fake cheese sauce (which honestly, you sometimes still crave...). However, their sopes and tostadas taste great and are totally worth the price. Their burritos have shrunk a lot, but are still the perfect serving size for the average girl, i think (I mean, if you get a few tacos on the side, too, that is... hahaa). Yeah, it's overhyped, but it's still tasty and open late.

Amazing tacos and tostadas.  The pork tamale was good as well, but after having a bite of the tacos and the tostada there was just no comparison.  And if I had to rank the tacos I had from my favorite to lease favorite, it would go 1) lengua, 2) al pastor, and 3) carne asada.   Stay away from their nachos.  It's movie theater cheese.

A great place for late night Mexican eats and very close to Downtown.  Loved everything especially the costillas rancheras.  I'm taking off 2 stars for the long, long wait time (despite of the 2 order windows, average wait time during the day is 30 minutes) and because they aren't open 24-7 and they don't serve pozole.

So I went to this joint at 1pm Sunday afternoon.  It was packed, good sign, packed with Latinos, another good sign.  Those were signs of  reassurance that never came to fruition.  This place is chaos warmed over, poor signage making it difficult to find out where to order and pick up food.  Numbers called over a speaker system that is antiquated.  I had to keep losing a seat to go up and get my food which I thought was called but since it was noisy, I never knew when my food really came up.  After waiting for 45 minutes for a burrito that I expected to be fabulous it was lackluster.  Poorly managed.  Food not great.

one of the best mexican places i've been to. a bit dissuaded by the overwhelming number of koreans in there though. and i'm korean so i know that they're korean aside from the obvious elements such as oversized fake designer sunglasses and handbags, those turquoise kitten heel slip ons and an overabundance of perms and guys with ed hardy trucker hats. but i don't blame them because the red sauce is spicy, perfectly suitable for korean tastes. i am a carne asada enthusiast so i had the carne asada tostada, tacos and burrito, which i split with a friend but could have well eaten all on my own. it was delicious. i only gave it four stars because five stars is reserved for something... spectacular. something prepared by a one armed mexican boy who keeps dropping the food on the dirty mexican floor while his one eyed hundred year old hunchback mother is making tortillas in the back. and i'd still want to eat it.

The tacos are good but what makes it truly delicious is the salsa. All Mexican restaurants are defined by their salsa. The better quality salsa the better the flavor. Food is more expensive than other similar restaurants. It is worth it over all.

I no longer live in California but growing up I remember this being THE very first place that I had a REAL carne asada taco and burrito.....simply THE BEST.  No extraneous toppings....no lettuce, tomatoes,etc...just the basics like it should be: meat, cilantro/onions, sauce and a small double corn tortilla.  I've lived in NY, Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee since 1994 and have yet to find anything even close to this place or anything like the real Mexican So Cal tacos.  I started going to El Taurino in the early 80s...it used to be a barber shop actually.  Tacos at the grand opening were .25 cents!  This is taco and burrito heaven and I'm happy to see that its still going strong.

Awesome! The hot sauce is really flavorful (you know, the kind that can burn a hole through your ass...haha!) and the carne asada tostada is my FAVORITE! Burritos are decent but I think coming from S.D, I'm more used to California burritos with sour cream and stuff (I know, not authentic but it's damn good). Would recommend: -carne asada tostadas -Horchata Always craving this late at night. Only down side is, I don't think it should be rated 1 "$" cuz for a mexican joint, a tad on the pricier side. Tostadas are like $4 something for 1! But worth the money.

Best bean and cheese burrito in LA. Yes, I said it. There's something about the cheese they use, combined with perfectly seasoned pinto beans that aren't mushy in the least. I usually douse mine in the salsa verde, which can pack some serious punch, so be careful! The meat-eating BF loves the carne asada and the tortas. Beware of the nachos, however-- they're little better than ballpark nachos. Odd cheese sauce and all. The downside is that this place is a madhouse unless you're able to go to the truck in the parking lot. Usually it's out later in the week and on weekends. It's gotten to the point that if the truck's not out, I'm not going (anyone know where it goes on it's off days???). I've waited 45 minutes more than once for a burrito and tacos. Not exaggerating. A close second is King Taco not too far away on Alvarado, which I'll hit up if I'm really feeling Taurino but not the absurd wait.

Not like it used to be. Don't know what happened but I'm sticking to King Taco from now on. Their burritos have gotten way smaller and they're damn stingy about extra hot sauce.

Oh, and they read your numbers out in Spanish super fast so time to remember your Spanish! Things to order: I loveeee their carne asada torta and carne asada tostada, and tacos. Their hot sauce is super spicy but oh so good. I'm a big fan of their green sauce too. Only thing is, they're kind of stingy with their sauces. I'm craving El Taurino as I'm writing this review.

I LOVE EL TAURINO! there is no better way than to end a night of drinking at el taurino. don't get me wrong, it's just as good when you are sober, but something about their food at 2am makes my mouth salivate.  i'm not exactly sure when they close, but they have lines even into the wee hours of the morning.  they have a truck outside that also takes orders, but you won't be able to order from the full menu that they have inside.  regardless, it is definitely worth the wait!  their tostada is something i have to order no matter what. the crispy tortilla with the avocado, onions, cheese, tomato and carne asada is to die for! their carne asada torta's are also very amazing.  my friends enjoy the bistec torta as well, but i've never personally tried it.  their al pastor is also a favorite, causing me to get atleast one taco with that delicious pork filling (: mm mmm goood~ don't forget to ask for their red sauce (proceed with caution because it is spicy!) and green sauce (milder for those that can't handle the heat).  they may be hesitant to give you more than one of each, but if you ask nicely they usually hand over the goods.   the walls are adorn with bullfighting memorabilia and at night the crowd does get a bit rambunctious, but all in good fun.  its not as boisterous during the day, so its a calmer atmosphere for lunch.  make sure to listen carefully for your number because they'll be yelling them out at top speed in spanish (more of a challenge for those that need to brush up on their spanish). just know that once you try el taurino, you'll be going back for more!

My go-to place when I'm craving Mexican. I live in the area, so it's an easy stop for me. I'm not going to say it's the best around, because (1) there's a lot of competition and (2) it's not. Pluses: 1. It really is good. 2. Parking lot has lots of spaces (and a security guard). 3. It's next to a Food 4 Less (multitasker here). 4. It's open really late. Minuses: 1. Takes a long time to get food. I either come with friends, bring a book or call ahead. 2. Prices are off. It's taco truck quality food (simple and good) for twice the price.

I grew up in this neighborhood.  I have raved about it for years. I grew up down the street.  Moved to New York, but talked about my home taco place....However.... Lived in New York and raved about this place for years.  Recently, I've had problems.  I use to get one cup of red salsa and one cup of green.  I love them both.  Now, I can only get one sauce.  Lately the meat isn't as good, and the portions are smaller. Go to the El Chato truck on La Brea and Olympic.  Portions are the same and they will give you as much sauce. Make the trip to King Taco on 3rd in EastLos.  The Best!

I've personally never been here, but I hear it's  very similiar to King Taco. Some friends of mine, who used to be regular customers, went here and they  complained  because the burritos they ordered were much smaller than usual.A  lady  named Adriana,  that  was working there, got angry because they complained. She told them that they were made exactly as before. They even asked to speak to the manager but he sided with the woman. I noticed that some other people on Yelp have also noticed that the burritos got smaller. My friends have decided to go with King Taco from now on. You be the judge next time you go.

El Taurino is as good as it gets.  WIth hundreds of Mexican restaurants, it's kind of hard to choose which is the best.  You can't go wrong here.  If you like it hot, the roja is so hot, but it tastes good (which is the most important factor to spiciness).  The green even tastes amazing, but I don't mess with it.  I need that fire. Afternoon, after dark, after club....whatever.  El Taurino is fire.

I expected the usual traditional Mexican burrito or taco. But what I got was the best carne asada burrito I've ever had in my life. The asada was so flavorful and must have been marinated in lemon juice which was a really welcome taste. Another good thing about this place is it open 24 hrs.

Best all meat and combo burritos!!! Prices went up a bit but still the best..By the way, portions went smaller too... Lines are long so make sure you r not in a hurry.

I don't really get this place. I think somehow it became really popular, kind of like a cult status type of thing. The food is standard fare to say the least. Also it seems as if they bathe the asada in lime juice all night, which is a technique to prolong aging meat. Yeah, obviously it has a huge following, but like I said... I just don't get it. I'd rather go to El Tepeyac in East Los.

If you're familiar with King Taco, this place is pretty much the same, but with a different name and a slightly bigger menu. If I'm not mistaken, I think they have the same owners (their tamales had the King Taco logo on it and they follow the same order/pick-up system). Whatever the case may be, the great taste of King Taco remains consistent with El Taurino. But like King Taco, it does tend to get crowded and the food quantities are quite small (Comparatively, their $5 burrito is half the size of a $7 Chipotle burrito. Sorry to compare the two, fans of authentic Mexican). A burrito, tamale, and tostada all costing $10, left me perfectly content. Burrito: the homemade tortilla was amazing, meat was seasoned well, as was the rice, cilantro and onions were the perfect complement. Tostada: never had anything like it, from what I could remember, it had: queso fresco, lettuce, beans, a slice of avocado, slice of tomato, sour cream (?), meat. There might've been more, but this combination proved to be greatly satisfying. Tamale: a regular tamale, but certainly the most flavorful tamale I've ever tasted. Overall, delicious. It's more so quality over quantity over here, so order an extra taco or two in addition to what you might usually get.

one word:   HOT SAUCE    ok two words. i am talking about the red one, not the green. i have never had restaurant hot sauce like this. it is soo good, when you ask for more, they look at you and if you white, they won't even give it to you.   ok, here's the deal, the hot sauce is thick, not watery with chunks of chili skins and seeds. this is a rich puree of I'm guessing habanero, with hints of Cinnamon and chocolate. and it is soooo damn spicy, i usually take like 3 hot sauce containers for one burrito. at el taurino, one small one and my mouth is pleasantly a-fire. i am actually not even sure if the food is that good cuz i am too busy putting hot sauce all over it. naw, just kidding the food is good. i always get the carnitas cuz that is my favorite. i like the rice, it has peas in it. upon entering el taurino, non-hispanics, it is a bit confusing and intimidating.  everyone in there is mexican and they kinda stare at you like what are you doing here. but never mind. here's the deal, get in the line and place your order, oh cash only. you well get a receipt with a number, then you have to wait around for you no. to be called. they are kinda slow, and most people kinda hover around the area where you pick up your food. which is kind of a good idea if you don't speak the language.   the neighborhoods a little sketchy but not unsafe, they do have a parking lot in the back.   prices are good, burritos are small to medium, which i  prefer so i can actually finish the whole thing!

Wow, my previous review of this place was horribly written. So bad! Anyhow, came here with friends because Susan wanted some carne asadas, which sounded good to me too after eating healthy too long! So I came back to this ultimate mexican food joint and got two carne asada tacos and shared a carne asada burrito with Susan and now I am fully carne asadaded out! The red sauce made my face turn pinker than usual but the horchata calmed my poor tongue. I actually don't eat meat that often (besides chicken) and this is one of the few places where I will actually eat the carne asada. The tacos were gREASY! But sooooo good. So good this place makes Taco Bell wish its bell was never rung (and I don't mean it the Anita Ward way).

The carne asada burrito. I crave it. But oh god it's spicy if you get the sauce inside - get it on the side. Get both the red and green sauce. I always end up walking out in a sweat but it's worth it! The burrito's are a little on the small size so order 2 if you're really hungry, especially because the wait can be a pain. The taco's okay. The nachos are awful - pumped orange cheese goo like at a gas station. And one star off for their horrible order/pick-up system. Also avoid Sunday nights the wait is frustrating. But god I crave their carne asada burrito.

Is it just me, or the burritos have gotten smaller?? i went back last week for the first time in months. I got my usual carne asada burrito, con arroz, frejoles, cebolla y cilantro, salsa aparte, and my horchata. My burrito looked like an enchilada!! I couldn't recall the portions ever being so small!! Don't get me wrong, I love el taurino as much as I love king taco... but their small portions and because they are so stingy with their sauce I am forced to deduct a star.

When it comes to Tacos and Tortas, the first thing that comes to mind is El Taurino! I think El Taurino makes the best Torta in LA! The bread is super soft, the ingredients are nicely balanced, and the carne asada is perfectly cooked! The fact that they are open all the time is great too! Not the most pleasant looking place, especially when all the drunk clubbers invade the place around 130-2:00AM, but i guarantee you will not regret trying this place!

Meh. So this was the great "El Taurino"? Seriously, just like it's sister taco joints (King Taco), the sauce really stood out. The tacos themselves, I would have rather from a taco truck. The major plus about this place, they serve alcohol!! I think if I was completely drunk, then maybe, just maybe I'd enjoy the tacos more. It was decent, but for some reason, I didn't like the fact the tortillas were a little on the dry side and the meats (Buche and Al Pastor) wasn't anything to really write home about. The buche, even well done, didn't have much crunch to it or flavor. The Al Pastor had a slight taste of the smokey/sweetness, but nothing much that said it was Al Pastor. I guess I'm just biased because my taco guy must sprinkle crack on his tacos or something, I just can't really come to liking other places. So for me, the search continues for a taco guy to sweep me off my feet. Thanks to Mike F. for getting me a second round of Horchata, that dang sauce was burning a hole through my tongue!

In the endless quest for the best tacos and burritos in LA, one needs to start with the number one contender: El Taurino.  This isn't a sophisticated neo-Mexican place like the Sonora Cafe, with its spinach & wild mushroom enchiladas, or El Coyote, serving its ostrich tacos- those places are all well and good... but when it comes down to authentic feel, one needs to start on Hoover, south of Olympic.  Walking in, one is confronted with bullfighting regalia and trophies, a mix of locals of many ethnicities chowing down in what has become a K-town icon. It is a place bustling with activity, families mixing with people trying to grab a bite after a hard day's work.  The menu is simple, the fare uncomplicated, but therein lies its brilliance.  Well-balanced carne asada burritos, cabeza that isn't waxy or too fatty, and a wonderfully flavorful pastor. Personally i prefer the old reliable burritos over the tortas & barbacoa (served on weekends) but the tacos are first rate too.  And you've probably read the other reviews concerning the 2 sauces here.  Apparently my gringo friends find the salsa verde (fire roasted tomatillios, done the right way) too hot- i guess they were expecting 'mild' sauce when they opt for the green stuff.  That would make the salsa roja unbearable for them, but perfect for me- hints of spices on the low end as well as a wonderful habanero and jalapeno burn on the high side, with notes of citrus (and vinegar?) bringing it all together.  I wish i can duplicate it at home, but its just too complex- i admit i usually buy a tub of the stuff to go, seeing that i've used up all the extra sauce they've already given me.  Something one cannot duplicate- now that's all one can really hope for when going out to eat, isn't it?

The wait wasn't that bad initially.  We went up for seconds and it took longer the 2nd time around.  But I uncovered the reason for the long wait.  The guys preparing and putting together the food had to go back and man the grills to get more meat ready.  I wish they'd use a nice charcoal grill to cook the carne asade to get a nice crust.  The carne asada is the best meat they have - good citrusy flavor and marinade..  We tried carnitas, barbacoa, el pastor and carne asada.  The one I'd stay away from is carnitas.  I don't know what this was but it wasn't carnitas.  The carnitas at Cemitas Poblano kicks its ass up and down the street everyday of the week and twice on Wednesdays.  What a joke.  I want my $1.25 back for this turd.  The burrito was flavorful mostly because of the carne asada and hot sauce, we ordered without beans as many suggested.  The tortilla shell is definitely not made in house and has a lot to be desired in my opinion.  The carne asada taco and el pastor taco were our favorites.  I very much enjoyed the hot sauce.  The next time I go back I'm going to try the special of the house.  I forget the name but most of the Mexicans were ordering this.  It was meat, beans, green sauce and a bunch of smaller taco tortilla shells.  The meat is similar to the kalbi you'd see at Korean supermarkets - the cross cut flanker with 3 bones in it.  It looked super tasty and these were flying off the shelf.  so there you go.

This place has a Mexican Jukebox! It's sweeeet! Nothing like overbearing Meixcan accordians to make you in the fiesta mood.  El Taurino is ghetto Mexican at its finest. Their tortas are tasty and their tamales are really good. Their salsa is hotter than hell and it will make you sweat.  Make sure to try the all meat carne asada burritos. They are delicious. You can't go wrong with seasoned meat wrapped in a tortilla.  Beware of the nachos... they taste nasty and the cheese is worse than Cheese Whiz.  Sometimes I stare at the dead bull heads that are hung so proudly throughout the dining area and it makes me a little grossed out. I dared a friend to pet one of the bulls but she said no.  Also, beware of the bathroom. The men's urinal is a trough that is filled with Ice. The actual toilet looks like Montezuma's revenge. Unless it is an emergency and you MUST go, then go in there or else I would avoid it at all costs.

Last time I went there with a couple of my buddies around 8pm, I waited, I kid you not, close to 40 minutes for a freakin' burrito and a taco!!! And the people who work there aren't that nice either, I saw a girl asking for extra hotsauce and this fat cook didn't want to give it to her. It's just hotsauce!!! I'd give about 4 stars for the food, but only giving it 2 stars for bad service.

I can't believe some people gave it less than 4 stars.  Unbelievable.  I remember first going there back in '92, and I didn't realize how good it was until all these other places couldn't fit the bill.  Seriously, you have to try their tortas.  I used to eat carne asada until I fell in love with the Milanesa (thin breaded meat).  Unlike other tortas, I feel like I can taste everything from the sauteed onions, hot sauce, melted cheese, avocados, meat, and the toasted, buttery bread. And you ask for the red sauce and dip the torta into the hot sauce.  Mmmmm.  Then you can't feel your tongue so you wash it down with some horchata.  C'mon!  The tacos and burritos are also good.  Everything looks good.  I'm not that crazy about the truck outside.  It's just not the same for me.  This place is always packed and I don't think they have to advertise.  It kind of reminds me of the "soup nazi" in Seinfeld....you are at their mercy and don't mind waiting forever.  Have some patience...it's worth it.

Best mexican food in la by far. It's different than typical authentic places. idk how/why, but the taste is just different. and the red hot sauce is hella hot but TO DIIIIIIE FOOOOOR. i always take my leftover sauce home and eat it on everything/anything. the tostadas are freaking good, except a lot of sour creme. And the chicken tamale is perfect. I also love the sopes here. The bread is perfectly soft on the inside and crispy on the very outside. The carne here is okayy, but all the rest of the flavors deff make up for it. If it's your first time, I suggest you try the asada burrito. It's unlike any other. They have take out as well, and also a truck outside in the parking lot for faster service, but it's limited. Best place to go when you're starvles after a club or a night out at the bars. It's open til 4 I think. And TONS of tables! You know it's the best mexican place because when you go in, EVERY customer is either Mexican or Korean. :]

Mexican Juke box! Matador artwork! Take a little trip when you go to this "nice place to eat"! It is a TRIP! No salsa bar here, no "baja" style fish tacos.... lots of meat choices.... tortas, sopas, tamales, tacos, burritos, nachos.  It is definitely for carnivores. Being (mostly) veg, I had a hard time finding something to order. But I'm always up for an adventure.  I decided on a veg sopa and a chicken tamale since I love masa. The tamale was super clean, excellent masa and the chicken looked clean and white. I just picked around the masa which I topped with a super hot red sauce they give you on the side and a side of guacamole. The sopa was nice and thick topped with a pretty small "shmear" of beans then fresh crunchy green cabbage and flavorful Mexican cheese.  I enjoyed the beans and only ate about half of the thick sopa. G got chicken tacos (surprise, surprise). He asked for no onions, but the green sauce had onions in it! The chicken was kind of shredded and boiled, not grilled like he likes. The tortillas were fresh and the other patrons there were a friendly mix of families, neighborhood workers and couples meeting for lunch (like us!). Go to check out the artwork and play a cancion on the juke box. A meat lovers paradise! I would get the tamale again. It was a fun experience and they have pitchers!

All my friends has raved about this place, so I was really excited to try it out.  When I tried it.. it was just okay.  I tried the carne asada tacos, carne asada torta, and carne asada nachos.  The portions are small.  The meat is decent.  This place just did not meet my expectations or even my standards.  I've been living in sd for over 8 years now and compared to the fast food late night mexican restaurants here, el taurino does not even come close to even a hair to places like Robertos #2, Coxitans, Harbenos, and Lolitas.  I do have to give it up to el taurinos on their hot sauce! It is spicy, even for me and I LOVE spicy food.  However, they were very stingy with their supplies.  They only gave my friends and I, 2 hot sauce and a couple of napkins.. for 5 people.. really?? One of the ladies yelled at another male worker for almost giving us 4 hot sauces.. so he took back 2.  Wow.. seriously? .. As for the napkins.. we had to even split it between the 5 .. I guess the note of the recession has really hit this place big time ..  Or maybe I"m just spoiled by the SD unlimited supply of hot sauce and napkins.  Whatever it is.. would i ever come here?? no .. i'll pass..

It almost pains me to write this because I've had El Taurino almost my entire life.  Having grown up in the Rampart district of Los Angeles, my fast food experiences consisted solely of Tommy's for hamburgers and El Taurino for Mexican food.  I remember as a kid, how massive and spicy the burritos were and always filled me up.  Also, my dad and I would always be the only Koreans throughout the entire restaurant.  It didn't matter that my dad spoke broken English at best, when it came to ordering Mexican food, his Spanish was on-par with the natives.  They thought he was from Argentina or something.  Anyways, something happened throughout the years.  More and more people found out about the place, which is cool because business got better and I assumed so would the food.  I was wrong.  Dead wrong.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say non-Mexicans (including Koreans) have ruined the place.  When it was strictly a Mexican-dense restaurant, they had massive sized foods, even cheaper prices, and it just tasted better (probably by using less stringent health practices).  The more others started coming in and not finishing their portions, and started bitching about getting sick here and there, the restaurant had to change.  The sizes got smaller, the food was less flavorful, and the prices went up.  Seriously, every other person in this restaurant was Korean, and Koreans are notorious for eating small but filling portions.  I can't come back here, knowing what it has become.  Whatever, fuck it.  There's always Chano's.

Don't believe the hype. My friends and I tried this place after hearing all about it and dropped by after going to a bar off SM Blvd. It does not take 40 minutes to make Mexican food. The meat is already cooked and all you gotta do is put it in the tortilla for f*cks sake. Took us forever to get our food, the rice in the burrito was dry and there was barely any carne asada in it. Portions are small, but prices are cheap...but it doesn't make up for the overall shittyness of the restaurant. The torta wasn't that great either, El Gallo Giro torta smashes on El Taurino's torta. Really unorganized and I have no idea what they're saying when they're calling out numbers...either speak up or speak clearer or get a new speaker system. Apparently the 30+ min wait is normal after clubbing, even full service restaurants are faster! It wasn't even that good, there are some many other options for Mexican food...never coming back again.

YUM! El Taurino always satisfies the craving for greasy mexican food :) I always come here for the CARNE ASADA. I don't really stray and eat chicken or pork here...strictly carne asada and it has never failed me. Never got food from the truck outside, and that seems to be working pretty well for me. I always get the carne asada sopes here and they're SO BOMB. They're pretty sheisty with their cheese on them though...MORE QUESO POR FAVOR. Top it with some green sauce...mmmmmmmmm. I also get the Cheese w/jalapeno (that's probably spelled wrong) tamale and the cheese is kinda rubbery but it's still good. I still always get it for some reason O_O The tortas are good too but I have to be REALLY HUNGRY and REALLY in the mood for some grease because that stuff drips oil. Still good though :) I also get the carne asade tacos. Can't go wrong with these. I like the horchata here because it is VERY cinnamony and sweet and the pina is also good. I really like the food here but the only down side is that usually it's always busy and you have to fight for a table with open seats and the table is dirty from previous mexican-food eaters. Not a nice place to eat like the sign says...but still, the food brings me back.

I'm not going to lie, when my friends and I parked into the lot before coming in, I was definitely sketched out. I honestly didn't know what to expect when I came in and I was very surprised. A friend had suggested to come here after we had gone clubbing and she definitely did a good job of picking out somewhere to eat. We wanted some food that would re-energize us after a long night of dancing and this hit the spot. My friends had ordered the carne asada tacos and I ordered a carne asada tostada. All of it was so flavorful, juice and tasty. The only drawback was that it was hard to hear your number since the microphone sounded muffled but other than that I was very happy with my experience here. Next time I'm around this area, I'm definitely coming back!

For the longest time I thought that this place didn't exist if I was sober...  But it does and it tastes just as good sans alcohol.  I love the tortas with carne asada.  Also the Rancheros Costillas (I think that's the name) is awesome. The guacamole is super spicy (yum!) so take it easy.  The line seems never ending but stick it out because it's so worth it!

With zillions of mexican restuarants in Los Angeles .... its really hard to decide. A life-long resident of the east side told my husband this was the best, and after reading the reviews on Yelp .. I had to give it a try!!!!!!! The first time, I had a burrito brought to me ... amazing! Last night, we went to the actual restaurant, and honestly, I was surprised by the eclectic mix of patrons: korean businessman in suits, white kids with mohawks and leather, korean hipsters,  mexican families and yuppies.  I ordered the carne asada plate, with beans and rice ... and it was amazing!!!! My husband had the nachos ... and it was a pile a chips with that cheap nacho sauce and covered in carne asada ... so probably not the most authentic thing on the menu. The red hot salsa made my nose run (which is just the way I like it) and I didn't feel gross after the multitude of food I ate (I'm really sensitive to gluten and corn) I'm a fan ... and this will be my go-to mexican spot until I get bad food or bad service (let's hope not)

Food takes forever. I've waited 15 minutes for 3 tacos, when the place was half empty. Portions are tiny. pay for jalapenos. No refills, you have to buy a whole new drink. Scary clowns that stand in the corner and watch you while you eat. Why come here when you can get the same food at King taco minus the clowns?? and on top of that there are many better taco/burrito joints in LA.

Ah El Taurino. Just going there brings fond memories of causing trouble in the neighborhood as a kid. I used to live  a couple blocks away on Magnolia and attended Hoover St. Elem. Well, about the restaurant...It's gotten a lot more hype than it's worth. People head over there cuz it's "the thing to do." Korean kids love to hit it up after clubbing and drinking because there's nothing else within the "safe" K-Town pocket. And many don't know their order numbers in Spanish. Hence, the long waiting time. Bandwagon fanatics typically get the carne asada taco or burrito. It's decent, but certainly not the best. When I do go, it's for convenience, and I always get the combo burrito con lengua y salsa roja; and usually a puerco tamale or two. Good with cerveza (but only Bud or Miller Lite). They'd serve micheladas if they knew what's good for them. Don't get me wrong...I'm not hatin on the place. I like it a lot. I just lost a little respect after they raised all their prices. Plus their burritos could be a little bigger. And I hate feeling rushed and sitting on a table with pieces of onion and meat from the slob before me. So I like to find other hole-in-the-wall taquerias and broaden my tastes since Mexican varies slightly according to region (i.e. Oaxacan, Yucatan, Guadalajaran, etc). I guess that's what you do if your ealiest memories of food consists of tamales and pupusas with cabbage, and if your parents owned a small Mexican carry-out with 3 awesome cooks for several years. Sometimes I'll do the King Taco thing on Pico or off the 5 on Olympic...very comparable. There are a lot of better bargain places out there...where they have bigger burritos stuffed with good beef and complimentary limes, jalapenos, pickled onions or radish on the side. I'd say El Taurino is a good stepping stone at best.

OK. That really sums it all up. I went here with my husband, very excited to finally get a chance to taste the "best mexican food ever". I had read many of the reviews raving about this place and had even heard very great things from many of my husbands coworkers. I hate to say that this place was overrated. By no means was the food bad, but it was mediocre. I have had better mexican food. Everything was as it should taste but nothing extraordinary. When I went, the wait was not as terrible as some people claim and there were quite a few registers open. We found seating and the parking lot is big. The security gaurd was nice and the clown was scary. I would eat here again if i was in the neighborhood, but would never drive from Long Beach to LA just to eat here. I was disappointed. ( I almost forgot- my husband says that the hot sauce was very good as others have claimed and they do accept credit and debit cards)

They're on a circle crisp tortilla (not in a bowl) and are authentically yum, with avocados and sour cream on top, amongst the other delicious items like tomatoes and juicy meat and lettuce.

Awesome sopes and tostadas. Mmmmmm. I love their horchatas, too. It is kind of a dingy place to eat at, but I love it so~! So many good memories. Yes, a lot of drunk people come late at night to get their Mexican fix. Most of them won't cause any harm. THey're just hungry! Hahahha. Their verde and roja sauces are soooo good together! The verde gives all the various flavors while the roja gives that spicy delicious burnnnn! Ugh, just thinking about them makes me salivate (drink the horchata to calm the burn! such a great combination). Their combo burrito is one of my favorites as well, but they've become so tiny! :(. I mean, it's still worth the 5 bucks, but yeah. I wish they'd stuff it a bit more. Oh, and you can't go wrong with their carne asada tacos. Those are always a hit. This place seems to be more populated with Korean-Americans as time passes, though! There are always massive groups of Koreans all the time. I think this is the place all Ktowners crave when they leave LA!

We were planning to go to El Cholo on Western Street but there was a 2-hour wait. So we drove around and found this place by accident. At first we were skeptical because it didn't look fancy and was really bright inside BUT we went anyway. It was 9 pm and we were really hungry. We ordered tacos (carne asada, lengua, molleja and carnitas), tostada, nachos and burritos. They were super tasty! Just a couple of things I didn't like -- a) the service sucks, you don't know which window to go to for your order, you can hardly understand what number they said; b) if you want authentic Mexican beer go somewhere else, they only have Miller and Bud here

The best place for late night tacos or a torta for lunch. It definitely beats a regular sandwich for lunch, and satisfies your late night hunger.

NOT ENOUGH BANG FOR YOUR BUCK! This used to be my favorite place to go for the best tasting tacos, burritos etc... until today, our office decided to order lunch at El taurino and each person had specific orders, of course they didn't get anything right, burrito came with onions, nacho cheese was not on the side , hot sauce was not in one of the burritos.... but that's not what really set me off, it was the ridiculously small portions they gave us! I had the most anorexic burrito I was done in literally 5 bites and I was still hungry after,   I've noticed over the past several years they've become more and more cheap with their portions not only that they overcharge for any extra's, $1.25 for extra hot sauce not to mention they limit you one free per order. , they're just not what they used to be.... they've become more and more greedy and today I'm finally fed up, I will not go to eat there at this location anymore, I will just go to King taco a little farther, it's the same thing.

el taurino has the best tacos in la. make sure to get sauce on the side unless you want your mouth to burn all night. and also get a horchata, it'll be crucial once you taste the hot sauce. the only reason i gave this place 4 stars is because the line is waaay too long. i waited for over an hour one time..... that and the prices have gone up a lot since i first started going there.

i've been coming here since college when there were only mexican customers and students from USC.  now people from all over LA come to this joint cuz its just that good.  it's all about that hot as hell red sauce.  i used to get the carne asada but noticed lately a strong citrus flavor - i think they use lemon or lime juice on it to mask that its not so fresh.  so now i stick with the carnitas which is solid.  (for the best carne asada in town check out yuca's on hillhurst in los feliz.)  at ET, i get the tostada which is amazing... they slather a bean spread on the crispy tortilla, load it with a mound of meat, tomatoes, marinated onion slices, avocado, sour cream and mexican cheese (manchego?) crumbles.  it's the best. the tortas are also really good and they hold up well so i always get 1 or 2 to go.  can't stand the long lines?  call your order in advance and when you get there you don't have to wait at all!

tacos are good, but the real winner here is the sope. delicious. red sauce is also delicious. only bad thing is the wait at 2am after everyone's gone drinking.

been going here for atleast a decade. i love everything on their menu and their sauce is to die for. i always purchase extra sauce when i visit and it never disappoints. cheers to el taurino. ... but without their sauce.. this place would be a bust!
